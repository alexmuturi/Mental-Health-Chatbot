CPTSD,Feeling like I was made to be unlovable,19353ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/19353ih/feeling_like_i_was_made_to_be_unlovable/,https://www.reddit.com/user/null_erase,null_erase,2024-01-10 10:17:20,Feeling like I was made to be unlovable,"I don't know if it was the emotional neglect, the psychological abuse, medical abuse, bullying, the CSA, whatever. I'm a mess right now. I feel like a horrible monster that somewhat a lot of people see as attractive, but under the facade I'm still a monster.  As if I was someone who was built for being unlovable and despised, physically and emotionally, since I was born. I keep working and working but I still don't feel fit for this world."
CPTSD,DAE not know what to do with themselves when they have time?,1934xy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1934xy7/dae_not_know_what_to_do_with_themselves_when_they/,https://www.reddit.com/user/DearAcanthocephala12,DearAcanthocephala12,2024-01-10 10:07:00,DAE not know what to do with themselves when they have time?,"See title.

I used to be the person full of hobbies (biking, drawing, reading, writing, walking, gaming) who really disliked people who never knew what to do with their free time and would be clingy. Now I am one of them.

Through years of hard depression and su.c.dal.ty thanks to cptsd I have stopped all my hobbies. I entrench myself in work and by now also meeting people and sometimes obligatory projects (like drivers license) to an extent that leaves me without any free time.

When I have free time and am alone I lie on the couch and do nothing. I think I even pity myself? Also hate myself a lot for being this way. Sometimes I watch Netflix for hours, doom scroll Reddit. Waste time browsing the internet. I try to sleep a lot.

Sometimes it’s better and I am interested in baking or gaming again, but super rarely. I do take regular walks by now though. But I have no “real” interests anymore… used to love to read, haven’t read in years now.

No interest finding anything new either.

I’m already 34 and I’ve wasted my whole life in bed. I had regular fights with my therapist about wanting to solve the “lying in bed and wasting away” being a huge problem for me (he didn’t see it as an issue) and that I can’t be alone either (he didn’t see it as a problem either).

I’m also ashamed in front of my partner that he sees me like this… either when I do nothing but also when I try something out, then I feel stupid like anybody can see right through me “look at this pitiful idiot”)… makes me feel like I’m an incapable child…

It makes me desperately unhappy and idk what to do to change it… stems from severe emotional neglect as child (I basically grew up alone, isolated and completely ignored in an abusive household).

I've been grieving a lot in 2023 and I'm still grieving. It's hard to accept my current circumstances. 

I moved far from my hometown to a large city knowing no one. I'm NC with all of my family. I work from home. I have somewhat of a schedule (despite spending the holidays alone, it was triggering and I couldn't sleep for days) and attempting to join adult classes and group therapy. Other than seeing my therapist once a week and trying to go easy on myself by fully and radically accepting my circumstances, it's been so difficult to feel fulfilled. I don't want to go on dating apps or online apps because they usually don't work for me. We end up having different interests or it fizzles. I'm also not interested in romance or any casual fling at the moment. I am not ready for a relationship as I have no life of my own that I enjoy and I've been codependent in most of my past relationships.

It hasn't been long since I decided to really buckle down to better myself and learn to be independent. It's only been a few months. 

I'm hoping I can practice social skills once I get into these classes and group therapy because it feels like I haven't made a genuine connection or decent small talk in ages. It's been making me anxious. All I do now is work on my mental health, figuring out who I am and what I want, and go into freeze mode. It's extremely lonely, but a lot less chaotic than what I'm used to. Has anyone gone through this?"

I won't go into to too much detail but he's had a rough life. I have my fair share of traumas too. We're both diagnosed but I've been able to afford therapy and medication consistently while he hasn't.

We see each other a few days out of the week. We both have abandonment issues so whenever we part, there's always some separation anxiety. I've noticed though that as time goes on, his anxiety's only gotten worse. We used to talk each other through it via text for a couple hours then be okay. Now he just keeps to himself and shuts down for a day or two. I try to send him reassuring messages and offer support but I'm not sure if it helps or makes things worse for him.

Should I just give him space and wait for him to reply in these moments? Is there anything I can do to help him regulate?

Alternatively, is there anything you like to hear from your partner or something you'd like them to do for you when you have bouts of emotional dysregulation? Is there anything you don't like?"

My mom is an externalizer. “Externalizers don't learn from their mistakes, look to other people to make them happy, and have a coping style that is self-defeating and destructive.”

I am an internalizer for the most part. “Internalizers are sensitive people-pleasers; they feel anxiety when they displease others.”

We are both externalizers and internalizers in different parts of our lives. But on what I’m concerned right now, this is an accurate description of both our behaviors on social dynamics/displaying our emotions.

We had an argument yesterday, and her behavior really got to me. She disrespected my boundaries/wishes to end the conversation several times. Right after that she told me awful descriptions of me. “The thing you have to improve is…” “Your problem is that you …” I’ve had enough of those comments because I take what people say into heart but those comments are just reflections of her emotional state. I know that intellectually but I’m still at a lost for what I should do to stop taking whatever she’s doing to/for me personally. I believe the trick to solving my temper around relentless people like her is to stop taking every inch of her behavior personally."

If you need to fall apart, I can mend a broken heart. If you need to crash then crash and burn, you’re not alone.  


Savage Garden was one of my mum’s favourite bands. She used to listen to them all the time, and so did I. When I hear them now, I feel connected to her. She died when I was 12 years old.  


I barely knew her. I knew her as “mum”. Not Debbie. Not even as a person. Just mum.. How fucked up is it that kids don’t even realise their parents are their own, independent people until it’s far too late? If we knew they had a life before us, hobbies and interests and dreams they’d given up, would we be such shitty brats all the time?  


I have so many photos. The printed kind, the kind they used to put in albums and keep on the shelf to pull out every now and then and reminisce. I have albums, too. She made them. She wrote the captions and the dates to remind us when those happy times were. Who those people were. What those places were.  
Now all we have are smart phones, and digital albums full of bullshit we’ll never look back on. Nothing real, nothing tangible you can hold. No captions. No handwriting. Well, that or Instagram. I don’t use Instagram. Fuck Instagram.  


Today was a good day. I had an easy, laid back morning. I made a nice lunch. I got myself a massage, then had an appointment with my GP, followed by an appointment with the chiropractor. Self care and health care, right? So why, after such a nice day, when I’m on the last leg of my drive home, does this song come on and I burst into tears?  


Trauma, friends.  


I heard the words in that song and I thought about her and it felt like she was the one singing them to me. But she’s not here, she can’t be the one to catch me when I fall. She can’t mend my broken heart, how could she? She took damn near the whole thing when she left.  


And what was I left with? The gift of more trauma. Adults who could never understand me the way she did. Who could never love me the way she did. They love me, sure, but not like that.  


Not just that they can’t understand me, they see the parts of me that she admired as something to squash. Something bad. Something that needed to be (metaphorically) beaten out of me so that I could fit inside the box they built for me. The box society built for me.  


Be a good girl. Good girls don’t talk like that, not so loud, why are you opinionated? Nobody cares what you think about politics. Nobody cares. Good girls clear the table after dinner and load the dishwasher and wipe the table. Good girls go to school on time and finish their homework and get good grades. Good girls clean the house on the weekend. Vacuum the floor, dust the shelves.  


Good girls grow into good women. Good women go to university and get a degree, something like nursing, maybe? Good women find a boyfriend, who becomes a husband, and they look after him. Cook dinner every night before he gets home. Do the laundry every few days so he has clean shirts for work. Keep a grocery list then go to the grocery store and find all of those things, don’t worry about the bright lights and the loud music overhead and the dozens of people standing in the way with their carts and the fact that you don’t know where anything is and even when you find it, why are there so many choices? Which brand is best? Which price seems fair? WHO CAN FUCKING DO THIS SHIT?  


Good women don’t have strong opinions about anything, especially not politics, and even if you do, don’t bring it up around the men. They think you’re a left-wing nut-job lunatic for thinking everyone should be able to afford a house to live in. Everyone should have access to high-quality, free healthcare. Everyone should receive a basic, universal income that is enough to maintain a decent quality of life. That’s socialist garbage, that is!  


Good women do all of that, and work 40 hours a week because the mortgage is too much for one man to handle. There’s bills to pay, too. And, God forbid, there are ever children to care for. Good women have babies, and look after them. And raise them to be good girls too. On top of all the rest of it.  


I guess I’m just not a good woman.  


I crashed. I burned. I’m still burning.  


Who will be the one I call? If I jump, who breaks my fall? There’s no one coming to fly away with me into the night.."
CPTSD,Constant slight dissociation?,1931n3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1931n3q/constant_slight_dissociation/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Deer_,Accomplished_Deer_,2024-01-10 06:22:42,Constant slight dissociation?,"Has anyone else experienced this?  I know that acutely, I dissociate when things are bad or I'm upset, it happened in therapy once and I realized afterwards.  But for a while now I've suspected that I'm a little bit dissociated all of the time.  My memory is a complete blur, even giving you details about yesterday would be a struggle.  I'm always tired, and always tense.  But I'm pretty sure I've felt this way for a long long time, maybe over a decade. 

On one hand, it feels weird to me that I could have lived for over a decade in a dissociated state without realizing it, on the other hand, I have these flashes.  Just a few moments where my muscles aren't tense and the world is just clearer.  And 99% of the things used to diagnose me as ADHD are also symptoms of dissociation... And it makes sense to me logically, I have hypervigilance and 24/7 anxiety, so if my fight/flight is constantly active, I could conceivably be in a freeze/dissociate state 24/7. But then again, maybe I'm just imagining it? Maybe this is truly the same way other people experience the world?  Maybe this symptom really is just in my imagination.  It's so hard to tell, it's like a fish in water trying to tell if it feels wet or not.

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone recovered? If so, how?"

I have DID- so that in itself is proof enough that i’ve experienced some pretty terrible abuse and neglect. I was just attempting to write a page on my life and experience growing up with abusive parents- but I had to stop halfway through as I feel exhausted and sick. I know they were abusive, Ive accepted that- but there’s still so many missing pieces to the puzzle. Is it normal to feel like there’s always something so much worse and scary lurking hidden in my mind? Like Ive been through hell and back but only have the scars to remind me, not the memories?


One of them being how it ever got to be this bad- Ive show many symptoms of sexual abuse throughout my entire life. It was never identified and treated because my parents refused to take me to professionals- well they would’ve never accepted i’m ill anyway and haven’t when I’ve attempted to open up to them, and they definitely didn’t want to be outed as child abusers. But also I was a smart, happy, social, outgoing kid- so no one suspected abuse- despite me having *clear* issues it seems like no one cared. All my parents, teachers, and school counselors cared about was me getting good grades. 

What’s crazy is I remember being a very sad, lonely, and confused kid who lived in my own imaginary world inside my head. I never had friends- and all my time spent outside school was alone, as I was even forgot about my family daily. I knew that I couldn’t show fear or depression because I would be punished for it, as I had been in the past many times. I remember hurting myself on the playground at my elementary school just to get attention from the nurses- who ended up telling me I couldn’t even come back into their office anymore unless I had passed out or broken a bone.

I have a memory of being a victim of COCSA at church while I was around the age of 4- this is also when my hypersexuality began. My parents deny knowing anything about this- but I remember telling them about the experience and being punished for being “too young to kiss boys”. I have heard of the term “covert incest” and struggle to accept that this may of been my reality. There are photos of me naked and bathing hung up in my parents house, and I have memories of my mother showering with me (well after I could bathe myself). Before I started puberty a regular punishment of mine was to strip and bend over, while being smacked on the rear with a hand, belt, spatula, etc. This stopped as I reached puberty because my father felt “uncomfortable”- which is also when he began to withdraw from me completely and show no interest in me as a person. As a child I was extremely clingy with him and hated my mother- I saw my father as my savior from my bipolar crazed mother but he never did anything to stop the abuse- in fact I suspect my father was my first sexual abuser. My parents spent multiple times during my childhood separated, and during these times I would be taken to my father’s every night. I suspect he could be my abuser because I get the same feeling around him as when I am/was around my other sexual abusers- shame, fear, disgust- I feel used and dirty. I also support this worry with many weird and uncomfortable comments I received from him that I remember, and things my mom has said about his relationship to me. I know the people here can’t answer for certain whether he was my abusers- but for people who have been sexually abused by their fathers (and maybe blocked it out)- how did you know? 

After reaching puberty I quickly began to indulge in hypersexuality- I was groomed by people online and IRL. I had multiple sexually abusive relationships- the worst being with an adult man, which began when I was 15 and lasted for two years. My parents knew him well and respected him, they allowed him into their home and into my bed- they often would use their usual isolation punishments on me but made a acception for the man to come over during my punishments. They knew he was raping me, and I was punished whenever they would find the evidence he deliberately hid for them to find.

My punishments my entire life consisted of being screamed at, hit, gaslit and manipulated, berated, trashing my things, and locking me in my room away from everyone- even family. Sometimes I wasn’t allowed to use the bathroom or eat, although it was never long enough for me to soil myself (I think)- I still struggle with disordered eating not related to my image. I also struggled with bladder issues my whole life, and still run the risk of soiling myself in public whenever I leave home- and I did many times in school and at church, etc. 

I have little to no memory of my life- and now as an adult i’m starting to remember things. The other day I have a horrible flashback and things are only getting worse day by day. It feels like it’s all slipping. I have so much to worry about already- between working to survive and afford my bills- barely able to eat and definitely unable to afford therapy- how am I ever supposed to accept and cope with my parents being violent, negligent, and maybe even pedophilic abusers?"

I’ve been doing a lot of reflection or maybe just ruminating about the shame I feel for drinking. 

I’m from a refugee background, and as a child, I experienced parental abandonment, FGM and SA. When I was 17, a man who was 22 years older started to pay attention to me and give me compliments at the restaurant where he worked.

 As I got older, we became “friends,” spending much time drinking in pubs. He enabled my drinking by buying me drinks and giving me a place to sleep. He pressured me into sex and made degrading comments about me.  When I told him I experienced FGM, he raped me to try to prove that I could climax. He would not stop until I faked an orgasm.

 Throughout this time, I made countless trips to detox and different groups to try to get sober.

 Then, one day, I  sat in a bar with my “friend.” I met the man who is now my husband. I immediately saw something warm and kind in him. 

For the first four months of our relationship, I was still involved with that friend so that I could keep drinking. After four months of my friend offering me cocaine and booze  to spend time with him, I finally snapped and cut him off completely. He harassed me for weeks with new numbers, but I did not give in. 

I was terrified of losing my husband. I was terrified I would spend my life drunk, degraded and sick. So I got sober and fucking stayed sober. 

I have a beautiful life with my husband and dog. We got married in August in a ceremony his mum had planned. She gives me the care and protection I never received from my mom. I am also building a new career for myself. 

My husband knows that that I was involved with a predator but doesn't know that it took four months before I was monogamous to him. 

I am tortured with guilt. I know I am not wholly responsible when a man twice my age gets me black out drunk, but I am so ashamed that I hurt him back then.  

I need advice. I feel trapped by the mistakes I made when I was drinking. Does anyone have a similar story

P.S. That guy was never a friend."

But then they were also there for you in really bad times so you feel major guilt about it?

For context, I went through a terrible year last year, where I basically had a mental break down and an awakening to how much CPTSD was affecting me. I spend all of last year just trying to get myself stable, and in the process I had some friends who really tried to reach out and be there for me, which I really appreciated (and honestly felt like they saved my life a few times)

But as I have gone on the healing journey, I’ve also realized how one-sided the relationships always were, and how I really wasn’t truly valued in the way I valued them. This all came to a head on my birthday a few days ago, when after all of the stuff I have always done for everyone’s birthdays, I was so so disappointed in how irrelevant I felt by all of my friends. Especially after the awful year I had. It woke me up to the fact that this is how it’s always been, that I will never feel enough, and will always feel used in one way or another. 

I am still learning my way out of my own trauma right now, and confrontation definitely brings up a massive fear response in me, because I just feel like I won’t be heard. So for now I am just not communicating with anyone and have just set a boundary about that. But honestly, I know these are the relationships I chose because of my trauma, and now I know I deserve better. 

But in some ways they have really been there for me, so I am feeling this massive guilt about leaving it all behind. Maybe I’ll get to a place to talk to them, maybe I won’t, but would ending these relationships make me a terrible POS?"

Stray upvotes and stuff but no real comments unless I’m manic or super passionate. I’ve had this account as primarily a lurker for 4 years and have only just hit like 900 karma or something.

And it's working but it's also raising a huge question for me. 
For context, the particular trauma I'm writing about and focusing on was being spanked with a leather belt as a kid for ""lying"" when I was telling the truth and didn't stop until I lied and said what the abuser wanted to hear. I was in 3rd grade. 

And today, for the first time, what happened AFTER struck me as weird. Within 2 or 3 hours, I went about everything as normal. Played with myittoe brother, laughed, went on with the day as if it hadn't happened. 

So here's what I'm trying to figure out: How often would I have been hit, to just act like it never happened a few hours later? How often was I hit for it to just seem like normal life? 

I still have a lot of repressed memories, but this one was something I've never forgotten. 

I don't know how to deal with that big question now. I'll take advice, support, anything. I've been talking to my spouse about it, they've been as supportive as they can but it's different from someone who doesn't have an idea of what this feels like"

By month 3-4 he moved in with me because he was basically sleeping on the couch at his grandmas then i got pregnant anddddd that’s when hell began. my mood swings were CRAZY and i was severely depressed so i got on meds for the first time. He started smoking and drinking every single day, i ended up losing my car (repo bc broke af), and couldn’t work bc of the pain of my baby pressing down on me inside. To make matters worse he didn’t even have a job too he was always on and off and the environment was toxic AF. That’s not even half of what i’ve gone through with this man. At one point i left him bc he got so drunk he put his hand on my neck bc he thought it was funny to scare me, he was throwing shit everywhere in the room where my baby was sleeping, also had to chase him outside.  Now my kid is 2 yrs old and i basically gave him another chance for the third time, and yet again i had to put a pause on my internship (i only need my intern hours to grad out, i started school after when bby was a few months old), lost my car(repo) and i’m broke again. Now i’m leaving him for good, i’m moving back into my family’s house, my mom is buying me a car cash 3.5K from my uncle, also i’m going to work with her on mornings (cleaning houses) while my “academic leave” ends. i’m so ready to move on and finally heal from everything. My prev. therapist  made me realize it was a trauma bond, i have low self worth and suck at boundaries.  he reminds me of comfort and chaos just how it was growing up in a abusive household, which is probably why i let him talk me into believing his manipulative words. He just makes me feel so shitty i swear, he makes me feel so shitty for trying to move on and says it’s breaking our family apart. But i know i can’t come back to this anymore, I’m so fucking exhausted all the time.  i desperately need to be on my own for my kid and myself. I won’t lie it’s extremely frustrating and difficult. Anytime i’m alone i just burst out crying, i can’t believe i let myself endure this for so long. All this emotional abuse, i’m a fucking mess.

My first therapist only wanted to talk about my romantic and sexual life despite the fact i was 13 and wouldn't change the subject when i tried.

My second therapist brought my parents in and told them about everything I'd said about them.

My third therapist was fine but unempathetic and often ended our sessions early he was helpful in some ways but seemed to think my anxiety was cured by our 11th session.

My fourth therapist flipped out roles and i ended up counseling him on his struggles with his daughter and wife. He ended sessions halfway before they were scheduled to end often and when i sent an email to inquire about talking through my suspicions about sexual abuse in my childhood he ghosted me and never contacted or set up another appointment again.

My fifth and current therapist has been better than the rest but is rigid and conforms to a very by the book curriculum to the point I've found google pages she's quoted when doing my own research after sessions. I've asked to take a more emotion centered or at least less lesson plan-esque approach but have seen no changes.

I've also been to the psych Ward once where me and the other patients were neglected, threatened and mistreated by the staff. Other patients were also able to do some off things without the staff interfering like suggestive comments or bringing female patients to secluded areas without supervision. Its hard to go in the detail on it but it was a very traumatic experience and i have nightmares about being sent back there.

Today i was seeing my current therapist hoping that maybe since i had the courage to bring up some of my childhood trauma for the first time we'd be able to talk about it or idk discuss it some maybe? I was let down again as she began talking about our curriculum and how we'd start doing radical acceptance stuff. I'll give it a shot like everything else but it seems like stoicism bullshit I've done before that failed and lead me here. I decided to do some research and found out she read off a website that was the first search result when googling radical acceptance. I don't expect a therapist not to quote things sometimes but i had hoped since we were following a curriculum that she wouldn't have to Google what she's trying to teach me about. This last sessions just left me wondering if she really is a good therapist or if my standards are just rock bottom. I read her some poetry I'd written which really helps me get my emotions onto the page and responded by telling me I should write about more happy or hopeful subjects.

I feel really discouraged by all of this. I don't know what's left to do to try and recover or process my life. Just accepting it and saying it is what it is, that's what I was doing before and i fell apart I've done it all before I've tried so many different approaches to getting better and managing my struggle and they just seem to fall through Everytime. I just feel so hopeless i really put everything i could into working on myself and into therapy and self improvement and it just doesn't work. I'm still getting worse and worse and worse. I don't know why I still go to session or even do her assignments. The mental health care field has failed me so many times and i don't know what to do."

I cycled often through the usual narcissistic family labels. Mostly either scapegoat or forgotten child. Got diagnosed in the mid 90s with ADHD--and was the ass end of all the dumbass psych fads at the time (hi Ritalin). Grew up religious, so that was often used by the narcissistic parents as a bludgeoning weapon when I'd protest their abuse. These were the parents who would hold up their fingers to naysayers and let said naysayers know they 'never laid a finger on [their] kids'. True, they never beat us physically, but mentally? Emotionally? Financially? Religious abuse? They were not above those things. 

Fast forward to 2008. Started university. Studied art/illustration. Switched majors to music. Almost didn't graduate six years later. Managed it though. 

2012 got married. Both her and I had codependency issues real bad. Didn't realize it at the time. 

Graduated college 2014. Moved to her parents' property 2015, and had our first child end of that year. I don't know how to handle kids because I had no childhood and loud piercing noises triggered intense anxiety in me. The deep self hate only got worse. 

2020, COVID-19 hits. I contract type 2 diabetes. We have our 2nd--a daughter. My brain and state begin to deteriorate rapidly. I develop an overeating disorder (that's when the diabetes hit).

2021 she declares she wants a divorce, we separate, I move out to my folk's place in another state. Custody fights and battles take place. 

End of 2022, I learn (finally) that my parents are covert narcissists, and have been emotionally abusing me my whole life. I escape that December. 

April 2023, ex and I finalize divorce. She sets the court order to being thus: 'child support will be worked out mutually between the coparents'. (Obviously she saw the writing on the wall and knew I was going through hell).

April 2023, hit a low low point. Drive to the nearby mountain range to view something beautiful in the wake of the ugly destruction of my life one last time before putting a 9mm in my skull. By an act of God, or the universe, or whatever, I don't follow through and go to the crisis center. Spend 10 days on suicide watch at the local behavioral health unit. Lose my job, lose my car, lose so much. 

Back at square one. 

Move in with my brother. Tried to keep a job there, but cptsd is ass like that. ADHD makes it no less easier. Get diagnosed with high functioning autism.

Moved to a new location again. Worst mistake ever. Idk what else to do.

I have a diagnosis of CPTSD & BPD.

For context: 
Over the summer, my trauma therapist suggested practicing gratitude. As my homework, I was to reflect upon my day. The objective, was for me to notice and note down what I was grateful for each day instead of focusing on the negatives.

Problem is: 
Growing up, whenever I was disobedient, my mother would reiterate how ungrateful I am after everything she has done for me.

Ever since my therapist suggested gratitude work, I worry she believes I’m ungrateful, just like my mother does. I mean, why else would she suggest gratitude work…? 

With that in the back of my mind, I feel hurt and quite down on myself. In fact, I withhold information from her and sugar coat what I do share with her. Last session, she mentioned that I don’t need to sugar coat the topics we discuss together.

Next steps:
Most importantly, I do not intend to speak to her about this. Why? Because i’m embarrassed and do not want my therapist to further believe that I am ungrateful.

ALL feedback, insight and advice welcome:
How can I get over this and become more open with my therapist?

I'm currently taking 5 different ones and have 6 bottles because of the dosage of one of them. I've been at a csu for a few days so the staff does my meds, each time I laugh to myself because of how embarrassed I feel for being on so many. If it's someone who hasn't done mine before, they are so unsure about my medication instructions. It can take them up to 5 minutes to prep them, meanwhile the staff who are familiar with me can do it in a minute or so. It's a tad frustrating because I can do it in under a minute but I just watch and try to be patient. I make sure to check before taking them because the first couple days they either added an extra or forgot one. 2 of the ones I'm on drop my blood pressure, so if they get it wrong I'm not gonna have a good time."

Dealt with mild bullying as a kid. But I feel like everyone and their younger sister deals with these things and turns out okay.

What I think either worsened or solidified my trauma was my romantic relationships. I dated any guy who would have me basically. And each one treated me worse than the last. Belittling me, blindsiding me, silent treatments, gaslighting, leading on, projection, devaluing, using me, coercion… again, pretty much everything except physical abuse. My last situationship was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I barely made it back from the brink of suicidal ideation. I had a plan. It felt like life wasn’t worth living because I’m not good enough for anyone to spend their life with me.

I’m doing better now, but I realized that I never want to feel that way again, no matter what it takes. I have no interest in dating anymore. Part of me is grieving the love I thought I’d have someday, but I realized that the risk is my life. Even though I know I have childhood stuff going on, these relationships have felt more impactful but it doesn’t feel like a valid reason because everyone goes through heartbreak. I’m ashamed of how much of my worth I’ve put into my relationship status. 

I also don’t know how to heal when it feels like not healing is protecting me. I’m in therapy but it’s not helping. I’m in a DBT skills class as well. But I feel stuck. The pain is like a shell that keeps me safe, safe and stuck.

in a family dynamic, how to laugh and talk about serious things, intentional greetings and ways of “seeing” others. 

As we were leaving for the airport, i hugged each of his parents and the hugs were so…genuine. There was a squeeze, there was a hold, there was a pause to embrace.

I’m still getting to know them but i’m so thankful i met my boyfriend. i am so thankful to be included. 

Not that my family is bad or anything…but my home was no where emotionally supportive, my mom was chronically ill when i was little, my dad and i ran the household, my dad was a workaholic with an insane temperament and neglected trauma/anxiety, there was rage and yelling everyday, my brother was the go-to trouble maker that also acted like my third parent. I spent christmas with them and cried the entire drive home, i was stuck in a freeze state for days on end, i couldn’t eat, i couldn’t drink water. 

I have put in efforts multiple times to try and communicate with my family. They get defensive, blame me as a child (even though i didn’t have the vocabulary!), go into rage, just say “sorry” expecting to just forgive and forget, stumble among their own feelings because they struggle to express from their own neglect and expect me to LOVE spending all this QUALITY time where we sit together in fragmented conversation and even silence way too frequently just to show we “love each other”.

i feel stuck navigating this but i’ve been in therapy every week since i was in elementary school. it’s hard not to blame or shame myself. i’m still learning to trust my body’s wisdom."

23m here. I'm living alone for two years now. from the age of 8, I have lived with a very dominant distant mother and two sisters. there was no father. all these years I experienced bullies at school and coping using extreme form of porn. I don't even remember my childhood fully. Fast forward to today, I work out 4 days a week, I quit porn two years ago and have a prominent career ahead, but I am literally scared of women my age. I can talk calmly with anyone who I do not intend to be in a relationship: guys, far older women etc. I have this severe need of being intimate with a woman that is suppressed with huge amount of anxiety at the same time. I have enormous amount of shame surrounding the idea of expressing romantic interest towards someone. I consider myself very self aware, I have to admit that I tried psychotherapy three times and it did not work well. This thing drives me crazy and I really want to figure it out, because the moment I encounter a person of opposite sex my age who also happens to be attractive, it feels like my body just shuts down and I began internally panicking. Any help in this is greatly appreciated, I see that you guys are a lovely community here."
CPTSD,I have an intense fear of failure. Could it be related to the fawning response?,192vo0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192vo0f/i_have_an_intense_fear_of_failure_could_it_be/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Shouseedee,Shouseedee,2024-01-10 01:16:38,I have an intense fear of failure. Could it be related to the fawning response?,"To be specific, I have no motivation to do anything because I haven't been told what to do or how to do it. 

It started due to my dad. Up until I turned four and abandoned my mom and I, he liked to amuse himself by tricking me. He would tell me to do something, which was usually either something that ended up scaring me or being impossible for me, and I'd cry which would result in him yelling at me to stop crying. 

At first I trusted my dad and figured that what he was doing was supposed to teach me something. I thought that if I could just do what he wanted, it would somehow make me better in some way. I don't remember what made me realize the truth. But when I did it created a betrayal wound that has yet to heal. 

After that point, I all but refused to do anything he asked without getting all of the information first. I didn't trust him anymore. I wouldn't be tricked again. 

Now, as an adult, I feel like I have to research everything before I start any new task. I avoid making choices because there are so many options and variables I can't correct for. I don't have much in the way of agency, and tend to do just the bare minimum. I don't like to have to figure anything out for myself. I can't. 

I want to be told what to do or have someone else do it for me. But, at the same time, I don't like things done for me. Nothing is ever good enough. I want my surroundings, my creations, my interests, etc to mirror me. But nothing ever does. 

Is this normal for someone with the fawn response? Could it be something else?"

Hey! This is my first time posting here and I hope this is the right place to post to. Please redirect me if this is not the right subreddit. 

Lately I have been experiencing severe chronic pelvic and vaginal pain. My symptoms include stinging, burning, and itching in my vaginal area and inside my vagina, uterus cramping, constant urge to go pee but not going pee, pain after peeing, constant vaginal feeling of being raped, and losing control of my bladder. This may sound like an infection or uti but I have been to the emergency room, urgent care, obgyn, and primary doctor and they have all found nothing and they have all said it’s psychological. I had expiernced severe prolonged sexual abuse at the ages of 14/15 with my 27 year old drug dealer, I never healed or addressed it because consciously I don’t think it’s trauma. It was in fact severe trauma but I can’t cope or deal with it so I don’t. 

I’m looking for anyone with a similar story or has expiernced something similar. Tips will help too, to ease the pain. The pain has become unbearable and I am bed ridden. If anyone needs more info feel free to message me and I’ll explain more. I just don’t know how much longer I can tolerate this."

TLDR: Going to public gyms is difficult, attending outdoor block parties or ""events"" is difficult, and going to bars/clubs has never been an option.

Interestingly, I love lofi, and any ""instrumental beat track"" out there; it's the bars and prose that trigger me...

...maybe the same reason performed spoken-word poetry messes with me, too. Hmm...

...but the combo with the beats sometimes creates an association.

Context:
Granted, I was raised very ""white American boy"", and while I was by no means ""sheltered,"" I was very undiagnosed autistic, with a sh1tty parent who was undiagnosed autistic, and rap/hip-hop just wasn't around me much until middle/high school.

Intellectually speaking, I know it's just because I was a very socially-alienated kid and that's one kind of music that was either outside my bubble, or was listened to loudly by the people who bullied me the most (of all races/ethnicities, actually). Plus the way racial segregation still happens culturally to this day impacts us all.

Anyone else have similar? Or any other genre at all?"

Hello, everyone. I hope you all are having a better day than mine!I am here to just vent. Thank you if you read it all the way through to the end. I appreciate you attempting to hear me out.

My father was pretty abusive and my mother negligent. I lived my entire childhood in hell.

My father died when I was 17 in the last year of my high school.I was in my bedroom when it happened. He just got discharged from the hospital.He choked on water in the living room and suddenly collapsed. I was in my bedroom besides the living room napping when it happened.When I woke up, there was chaos all around. But I don't remember any of that.There was a small Buddhist shrine in the living room. He started collapsing on the other side of the room from it.When I woke up, he was in front of the shrine. I suppose he wanted to pray before his life ended.When I woke up, all I could see was him praying and slowly collapsing into a heap onto the floor.I could see him trying desperately to cling onto life. I could see the fear in his eyes. That's all I remember from that day.

Some people told me not to feel guilty but I guess I do in some ways even now because I was the only one nearby. What if I had not taken a nap that day? Would a life have been saved?

Fast forward. Two days later, I am at the funeral procession. Before his body is prepared, I am brought into the back with my mother. It's funny how much the fingers and the feet look weird after people die. His feet were curled up in a way that I can only describe as distinctive to dead people. His eyelids were half-open and his jaw dropped. I still remember seeing his front teeth. But all I could see was the fear in his eyes the moment he died.

It's been more than half a decade. I'm starting to recover from my CPTSD from the abuse. But every time I feel shitty or have a flashback, those two memories come back. Even now, I cannot stop seeing those desperate eyes and the frayed feet. They haunt me.The man was a horrible human being. At one point, I even plotted to kill him myself.(I was 13-14.)I don't know why this haunts me so much.

Last year, I was doing mushrooms with friends and at one point, I looked at my feet and said ""Oh, I feel shroomy and now my feet looks like that of a dead person.""My friends were understandably weirded out and concerned.That's when I realised. When you bring down all the walls that shield my heart and all the weights on my shoulders, these are the things that are still haunting me.

I feel broken beyond repair, my friends. I know this is just the inner critic speaking and that I have made a lot of progress with my trauma but I cannot help feeling this way from time to time.

I am tired of carrying all this on my shoulders. I hope it gets better one day.I wish it gets better for you as well, stranger."

Of course I told my mom and she was super cold. 🙄 She’s been doting about my siblings for weeks and is suddenly cold when I need something. Same pattern as when we were kids (we’re all in our 30’s now).

He assaulted me (grabbed my penis) talked about killing me. I left the apartment. 

Well he ended up going back to the group home, even after that he stalked my social media's, has been seen around my parents house, and I'm pretty sure he's been talking with my stepbrother and convinced him I'm a pedophile. 

He's been saying ""its on sight it's on sight"" 

I'm scared because this person already killed an animal in front of me, choked his ex girlfriend, and played all kind of mind games to blame his abuse on me when we lived together 

He gets out of the group home this summer, and is not allowed at his parents house. As far as I know has no other friends or anything waiting for him. He careies knives abd has a grudge. I'm scared for my life, that he'll either attack me or continue to manipulate things from afar as he has for the past year 

Im also male if that helps.

Edit: by the way I did report him to the mental health clinic we both went to when ìt all first started, they went from ""Yeah we'll handle it don't worry"" to ""no you're just trying to get him in trouble"". After the latter was when he assaulted me and started gaslighting/bragging about how powerful he feels "

Any advice?,"Hi all,

I live with my dad and we are estranged from my mother due to her abuse of both of us.

She is currently in a legal battle with him regarding financials and she will be at our home this weekend to pick up all her old things (This is years after the estrangement)

Despite my insisting, my father didn't manage to arrange the pickup to be elsewhere. It will be at our home. I have a feeling my mother manipulated him and the situation to be this way -- she literally asked if she can come in the house and she has started personally emailing him and calling him (which doesn't feel right -- today I walked outside and he was hanging up after being on the phone with her, and he was startled as if he didn't want me to know)

She is manipulating him as before, and he is still scared of her.  He also says he feels obliged to heed all her wishes because otherwise she may ramp up her legal case and we could end up homeless ( we are on the poverty line as it is ). He is very worried about this and I can understand

I am considering my options for what to do this weekend when my mother comes to our house. Please know that she hates me because I broke free from her; she has some concerning mental problems and could behave unpredictably; and she has actually tried stalking me at this house a couple of times about a year ago (I am hoping to get a restraining order in the future). 

Due to these stalking behaviours, I really don't want my mother to see my room and rummage among my things -- which I sense could happen if I am not here, given my father's inability to stand up to her.

It's also gone through my mind that I could be here at the house and film it all -- do people do that during transfers like this(?) -- but I really don't think I should be present during the transfer. My safety matters most.

I have received extremely helpful advice on this sub before (eternally grateful 🙏) and was wondering if you could help me with this...  What do I do while my abuser mother literally comes in my house this weekend, with my (also abused) father being unable to stand up to her?

I think the best thing is to get tf out for the day / a few days, bringing any valuables with me?

(And yes my dad being unable to protect me properly is a recurring theme and arguably abuse in itself. I am working on getting out of here for good, but as you know it's a process and i'm not quite ready yet. Please understand x)

He'd do it at home in front of my mom but not around other people, and my mom declined to do it with me. Sometimes he'd even stop me randomly and give me a candy that he'd been sucking on for a while, without me asking. 

Sooo... This is weird right? Or is it a thing that's uncommon but not unheard of, like parents kissing their kid on the mouth?

After years of pondering if/when I should go to therapy, I decided a couple weeks ago to leave an appointment. That appointment was yesterday. In the beginning, my therapist explained some formalities, insurance stuff etc.. and then finally said ""alright, so what brings you here?"". I had thought about what to answer ever since I left the appointment weeks ago. 

But the SECOND I realized that it was my turn to talk, all my planning flew out the window. In the first sentence I spilled how my parents have abused me throughout all my childhood. And immediately once those words left my mouth, I started BAWLING. I was talking through tears for the entire hour of therapy. I could barely control what I was saying, I was rambling random stuff about my childhood trauma. My therapist handled it great. She gave me a box of tissues and said ""You're apologizing for crying, I'm guessing you see it as something negative. But for me it's part of my profession and I am perfectly fine with it. You don't have to apologize, take your time. You are talking about something horrible that happened to you, it makes perfect sense to cry."" I felt very comfortable crying and explaining my past to her.

Now why does that matter? 

I have never ever once said out loud what happened to me in my childhood. Not once. Not to anybody. Not to myself. Not even to my best friend of 17 years who I would trust with my life. And I was scared and nervous. Because the second I SAID it, it was serious. In that moment, my trauma became REAL. It was not something I carry around in my head anymore, a place that says ""Was it even that bad? Did that really happen to you? Do you remember it correctly? Doesn't it happen to everyone?"". It was not a shameful secret anymore. Now it was out in the open, out there in the world, and known to my therapist, a person that I had just met for the first time in my life.

After the hour of therapy I felt incredibly relieved. But once I got home, I felt... emotional turmoil. I could feel it in my gut. I could feel it in my head. I was still crying 5 hours afterwards. I kept tearing up every hour or so.   Then I also felt regret. Should I really have told her all that? Especially that quickly? Was I weird for doing it that way? What does she thing about me?
I was contemplating if I should even go to the next session. I was wondering if it is even worth it and if it will help. 

I cannot believe simply mentioning my trauma on a superficial level like that wrecked me that hard and sank me like a ship.

But now, 24 hours later, still tearing up for some reason, I know I have to continue doing this. This is the right way forward, even though it's hard to sit there and talk about the things I least wanna talk about, I don't even wanna THINK about. But the answers are burried somewhere in there, where I least want to look.

It is scary, but worth it.

Thank you for reading, and: If I could do it, so can you. Trust me. I am rooting for every single one of us to get better. 

Sending love <3"

The game showed parts of the intimate scene (not p*rn, not downstairs bits shown) but seeing a character representing me engaging in those things... all the same voices that called me ""wh*re, sl*t, etc"" and the guilt pounced on me just as it did every time I was r*ped as a child.

In my own life, I am not sexually active because the same guilt overrides any possible pleasure that could be derived from it. I hate seeing my breasts, hate myself if anyone perceives me sexually 

Naïve of me to assume that a game would be inconsequential. Now I just feel ridiculous and pathetic. 


**spoiler of SA, as my emotions are triggered from previous and repeated SA from between 14-19 yrs. The game did not show SA, just to clarify 😅**"

I’ve been with my girlfriend for six months and she’s a wonderful partner who I can have difficult conversations with. I couldn’t be happier and we really grow from problems that come up in our relationship. We don’t have any huge issues in our relationship, we have disagreements it’s alway due to miscommunication because we have different communication styles; we always come to a common ground and we learn that we think the same but need to learn how to communicate better. I’m happy to say that we’ve learn and grown a lot in our short time together and I think we are both very happy together.

I have no reason not to trust my girlfriend, she has an abundance of reassurance for me even though she is not naturally a verbal person with her feelings due to her upbringing; I sincerely appreciate her effort to provide reassurance although is not natural to her. She doesn’t hide her phone from me and if I really wanted too, I can ask for her password and go through her phone; however, I never ask her for that because I know that’s sort of opposite to the concept of trust. 

In a few months she will be going to Las Vegas with her friends to see a concert and see the night life. This makes me sick to my stomach as I literally cannot imagine a scenario where she won’t cheat on me. 

She has done nothing to make me question her loyalty but 18 years of daily verbal abuse from my parents has demolished my self esteem. I’m now 27 and have tried healing from reading Pete Walker and listening to Tim Fletcher and I’m happy to say I’ve grown tremendously; however I cannot trust my girlfriend who hasn’t even done anything to make me think she would ever cheat on me.

I used to self harm physically for years and I’m happy to say I haven’t physically hurt myself in years, I feel a strong urge to self harm mentally by breaking up with my girlfriend. I still feel unworthy of love and breaking up with my girlfriend will satisfy the desire to hurt myself; furthermore, breaking up with my girlfriend will eliminate any uncertainty in my relationship. I cannot question her loyalty if we aren’t together in the first place. 

I know logically that breaking up with her is irrational but I have a strong yearning to return to the comfort of self harm and isolation. Being alone hurts, but dealing with the pain I cause myself is familiar and makes me feel like I’m in control.

Has anyone here experienced something similar and how you overcome these feelings?

It took me new antidepressants, a night of no sleep and a parent sitting across from me who didn't acknowledge my wellbeing and was talking about every topic under the sun except for my health (they know that I am struggling). I cried for half an hour, and they didn't hug me, or asked me if I was OK, which put my whole journey into perspective. I don't remember much from my childhood/teenage years but I am suspecting I never got a hug when I needed it.

I was told crying gives relief, but I feel like my nervous system is about to burst, and I think it was maybe better before. I have no energy to cope with this new sensation I'm feeling in my head."

I remember bits and pieces. 

The first customer may have had a point, it was a misunderstanding, but she started calling me a ""B\*tch"" and I lost it.  She left to complain to her husband. 

Right away I had to deal w another customer and was  initially cool headed towards him.  He did the ""I want to get a discount and speak w your manager"" thing.  I gave him a pen to write down his info so I could give it to supervisor who was due in 2hrs.

He threw the pen at me  saying I should have his information--and I went into another ""headspace"".

I said alot of things I barely remember, just stress responses.   Not a black out, but just what ppl would call ""a blind rage"".   When I remember the things I said back, I cringe.

Why did'nt I just stay quiet.  The words just shot out of me. I'm embarrassed. 

I think this job is not for me- I wasn't prepared for how volatile ppl would be.  It's a customer service job- rental cars- so stupid me didn't get the memo about ""taking so much hate"".   

I just didn't do my research.  

I put in 2 wks notice to quit--but feel scared about it all.  I just want a job.  I just need a job.  

Why am I so stupid and what kind of job can I handle?  BTW, I may be dysfunctional at times, but am what you'd call a ""people person"".  I thrive in busy social environments.

What kind of job should I go for?  What kind of training do I need?"

My father is a covert narcissist who has caused me repetitive traumas throughout my life. He hasn’t been the only one but as of right now that’s been what’s been triggering me so much. He is repeating the cycle. Repeating the same behaviors he did throughout my entire childhood and it’s created a flight or fight response in me that I really don’t know how to deal with. Every time he lashes out or acts out I go into extreme overload and panic. I also get so incredibly angry. It’s to the point we get into arguments pretty much every single day because of his behavior. 

I really don’t know how to deal with it anymore. It’s been like this for the past 5 months and it has been incredibly draining. I feel so tense all of the time and struggle sleeping from how bad the anxiety is. Every day I just wait for him to get upset again and it’s the same thing all over again. It’s draining me and making me into an angry person and I hate it. 

Any advice on how to bring this up to my psychiatrist? I don’t want to seem like I’m self diagnosing myself but it’s become a real problem. I’m starting to feel physically sick from all the stress."

I am 26M. I recently got a diagnosis of BPD for the first time (along with major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). Reading about Quiet BPD made so much sense and resonated a lot. I also know I had a trauma happen at 13 that really impacted me and my development, and I’ve come to learn about my childhood and dysfunctional relationship with my father before that.

I think my default setting, in between periods of more confidence and stability, is to regress to being a teenager fully dependent on his parents, unable to cook or care for himself, unable to keep jobs and sleeping all day, eating junk food and escaping reality through sleep or occasionally movies and tv shows.

I know how important connection is, and I know just a few days ago I was feeling so much more grounded in my true self, as quickly as the regression comes I feel like I have always been like this and will always feel like this, unable to care for myself, unable to keep a job, unable to live. Needing to live in my parents basement, sleep all day, watch tv/be on my phone all night, and just ‘wait’. 

Although it has been years and a lifetime later now, I don’t live with my parents, but I still don’t know how to figure this life out.

CPTSD,Old memories of physical abuse as a child are drowning me,192oj4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192oj4l/old_memories_of_physical_abuse_as_a_child_are/,https://www.reddit.com/user/clan_mudhorn,clan_mudhorn,2024-01-09 20:22:50,Old memories of physical abuse as a child are drowning me,"My household was very abusive. Parents loved to be perfect at church and the community, but both would turn into monsters at home. My dad would beat me a lot since I can remember. I have a lot of memories these days about him beating me to feel good about himself. He is a very insecure man. It often was when he made a mistake or something pointed out something he didn't know, he would boil inside in anger that he didn't know everything, and would take it on me.

I'm the eldest (now 44, with a son, and we are NC from my parents), and was recognized as highly gifted. I was bookish, got good grades always, have been succesful academically, I have a doctorate even in something brainy. I think they always knew I was very smart, and my dad really resented that. So many beating was that he felt inadecuate with me, I realize.

We weren't allow to do much at the house. Not go out. Dad dominated the TV.  So I read a lot of books. I loved reading. I read encyclopedias, I read my mom's old university textbooks as a small child, I was just so eager to read whatever I could find. And at some point, he started to hate it. Really hate it. He could come to my room at yell at me for reading too much. It wasn't that I had chores to do or something. It was just he hated that I might be learning.

And later for some reason he would get offended for anything I said, asking if I knew more than him. He would ask me to stand in front of him, while he hit my head and torso from side to side. It would start with open hands, but he would get more enraged. Often he would blame me for getting enraged, saying things like I had to look at him in his eyes while he hit me, or getting angry that I was staring at his eyes while he hit me, that I had to show I was humble and look down. Sometimes he would mix them up. He would often tell me I had to show respect to him, that I had to learn he knows everything. He would also say he was all-knowing and that he was going to teach me he was god. This happened almost weekly, that he felt slighted somehow for his intelligence, and I would have to take it. Sometimes I didn't even say anything, it was something unrelated to me, but he would claim my eyes said it, and he would take it on me.

I seeked helped, but all adults around me told me the usual invalidating stuff: he is doing his best, he does it because he loves me, God has a purpose, have you tried being a better child? Etc, etc. I hadn't thought of many of these beatings for a while, and I feel terrible guilt like I had been invalidating myself.

I decided to go NC because of some horrible things Dad did while I was visiting him, that hurt me professionally dramatically,  affected my income, and through that, my son. He was always very good to him, which felt like he trying to make it up somehow. But when I confronted him that the thing he did not only hurt me, but hurt my salary and him, he said ""It doesn't matter"". A month later he wrote a text that he had already asked for my forgiveness (he didn't), so I should let him talk to his grandson. I blocked him then, and have been hermetically in NC for many months now. It's not hard, because we live abroad.

At first, I thought I didn't mind if son called his grandparents every now and then if he wanted. He is 11, and I felt maybe if I didn't let him, I would be the bad one, or make them the good ones. He didn't show interest in talking to them, which was great. But a week ago, after months of not thinking of them, he talked to his cousin, who mentioned them, and he asked me about them. I changed the subject, he didn't seem so interested anyway, he just had realize how much time he had passed. I know I have to talk to him about it, but I started to feel afraid and guilty.

Afraid and guilty. In part because I know my Parents will pretend to act well and be nice, but they will start using him to send me messages, and eventually, messages with attacks he might not understand, or might make him feel bad. It how they always have been. In part because I worry letting him talk to them is exposing him to their manipulations. But then he does have a VLC relationship with them, and he does like my dad.

I think this inner conflict is what triggered a lot of my old physical abuse memories. I feel overwhelmed by them, and memories of how adults I trusted would invalidate  me and tell me to accept the abuse.

They never say what they really feel. They say one thing do another. Their actions and words never match up. I have observed a few actions and behaviour of a covert narcisstic father of my friend. His passive aggressive attitude can leave one extremely confused and almost obsessive. Because it looks so harmless but it can mean so much more than the eyes meet. 

Here are some actions of a covert narcisstic dad of my adult friend. Those who might have had a similar experience can share what you feel about it. I will also leave a brief explanation of what my friend felt about the experience. 

1.Covert Father telling his adult son who is trying to move out from the house and go NC : ""Wherever you go, we will always be watching you""

This statement made my friend feel paranoid. However the father claims his intention was that he will be watching over him. 

2.Covert father threw away a lot of personal belongings of his adult son despite him telling not to do so. He threw away gifts from his friends. 

This made my friend so affected as it made him feel disrespected and unimportant.  It also made him feel his father deliberately wanted things that reminded him of his friends to be discarded. 

3. Covert father starting a conversation when adult son was angry despite telling him not to engage with him during that moment.

My friend felt he was being deliberately provoked at a time when he was feeling agitated and the father did it purposely to get a reaction out of him."

After years of being mistreated and abused since my early childhood, now in my 20s I found a person I feel completely 100% safe with, they get me and I trust them with anything, it's difficult for me to trust and feel safe with someone so they were special, became a parent figure and they're part of my living situation so I see them everyday.

The other night when alone they made a very inappropriate comment that just shattered my heart, it filled me with dread and it's making me rethink out whole relationship, I can't talk about it with anyone, they were the person I trust, they only person I feel safe with and now it's just gone, they left me alone. They KNOW the CSA I suffered, how much I want to kms, how hard it is for me every single day to not kms.

I'm just so mad at them, why did they had to fuck up our whole relationship and throw it down the drain in one sentence.

I'm gaslighting myself into thinking I misunderstood or It isn't that bad just to cope and make the living situation bearable but I can't, I can't keep going like this this is just too much, it's just the last straw, I feel so betrayed seeing the way they always saw me.

My husband and I have been with the same couples therapist for probably over 5 years. She is a little bit old school, but is somewhat trauma-informed, and came very highly recommended by my psych. 

There have been times when we blurred the line between couples and individual counseling. Part of why we see her is that my cptsd and his go-with-the-flow-ness make it hard for us to address issues head on, so she gives a space to do that, but a lot of things circle back to my triggers. She also pushed hard to be there for me individually when I was between therapists for a few months. (Which I didn't really want, I was intentionally taking a break after 10 years straight of individual therapy, and I don't love her style when working individually - but still, she showed a great deal of care for me )

But something is going on lately. The session before last, she said something insensitive about my relationship with my mother, and I cried. I thought it was a misstep, but at our session yesterday it became really clear that she is projecting something of herself onto my mother. Lots of ""she made mistakes but she loves you"". Lots of insistence that my sending my mom a Christmas card with money is some grand statement about how much I love her and couldn't possibly really want to cut her off - despite me repeating over and over that the card was to keep the peace and kick the problem down the road because I'm not in a place to handle the confrontation right now. 

There was more but I dissociated pretty hard and don't remember most of it. 

That was yesterday. Today I'm having terrible brain fog and am really sad. I'm trying to just be kind to myself and take care of myself. But it's really hard. 

And I think, somewhere that I can't access right now, I'm really angry. We've worked with her so long and she's been legitimately helpful, I don't feel like this is enough to ditch her, and I certainly do not want to play another round if therapist roulette right now. But why would she do that? I know she knows better. I don't understand what happened."

&#x200B;

I'm not going to act like I'm a victim in past relationships because it takes two to tango. But in my past two relationships I broke up with them probably way later than I should have after they cheated on me, stole money from me, physically abused me, destroyed my prized possessions, called the cops on me with false accusations (even got dragged to court then case dismissed). I sure know how to pick them. I also know I wasn't the most perfect partner to them (didn't physically abuse/cheat on them) so not trying to have a pity party.

&#x200B;

1.5 years ago by some fate of the stars I met my current girlfriend and I love her so much that I am writing this post after she gave me a reality check yesterday. Logically, she is the most healthy, safe person I have ever had in my life. She is an open book, she prioritizes me, she communicates clearly, she does things to make me feel loved and seen. She's never raised her voice or done anything to hurt me on purpose. Even when we argue she is composed and never throws personal insults in my face like my exes do. She actually wants to know what I think and feel which is alien to me. She is smart, beautiful, and sensitive to my background. I honestly don't know why she's with a POS like me because in every dimension she is beyond my league. I know everyone is thinking that too.  I'm waiting for the red flags or the inevitable shit show to start and it's not happening yet.

&#x200B;

But I can't help but have moments where everything seems fine but my brain screams at me that she is lying to me or hiding something from me. I notice everything to the point it's a curse. I notice when my laptop is not in the same place it was when I left it, when I hear background voices when I call my girlfriend, when I see that the passenger seat of her car has some dirt marks on it like somebody else sat there. I can't be wrong every time. I let these observations fester in my brain until it creates a ball of rage and betrayal because she is obviously looking through my shit, putting me on speaker and letting others laugh at me, or f\*cking someone on the side behind my back and having them ride in her car. 

Why? Because that's what all my exes did to me. Because people have looked me in the eyes and said they love me, while they are cheating on me or using me for gain. I know to a random person I sound unhinged. But I can't help notice these things. I also don't want to come off as an abusive control freak so I shut up about these observations and my girlfriend is none the wiser, until inevitably I explode at a random moment and accuse her of spying on me, cheating on me, laughing at me. I'm ashamed to read back the messages I type or the things I say to her. 

She acts completely shocked and hurt but I honestly can't tell if she's faking or not. SHe begs me to tell her what exactly she did to make me angry and I feeel so fucking stupid pointing to how my laptop moved or some shit and the more she tries to comfort me and promise she didn't look through my stuff, and ALWAYS has an excuse like she moved it because she was cleaning the living room, I don't know what to believe. IT's the same shit excuses my exes gave me and the logical side of my brain is telling me to believe her but I'm just so suspicious of why she is even with me and then after the dust settles I'm such a coward I can't even talk about it again even if my girlfriend does. I can tell she's hurt and holding onto it and trying to resolve the situation. She tells me that I should be with someone who I Trust and feel safe around, and if she's not giving that then that's not a healthy relationship for either of us.

&#x200B;

Two days ago I blew up again at her for no fucking reason while she was trying to comfort me on the phone because I was triggered and enraged after one of my buddies screwed me over on money I lent. I heard whispering in the back and I knew in my heart she must have someone over and they are listening to the call and laughing at me, I hung up and texted her some vile shit. She messages back shocked saying she was watering her plants and that was probably the background sound, she begged to Facetime me so she can show me nobody is here, she shared her electric door key history to show nobody came in or out, and suddenly now I feel like the crazy abusive boyfriend again. She put her foot down and said she is not my exes, that the things we argue about are not actually about things she DID or SAID but about betrayal scenarios that I make up in my brain and refuse to ask her about early on as soon as the insecurity flares or an observation is made. She's right. But I don't know how to stop this cycle. I do see a therapist somewhat regularly since a few months back but I've also had therapists quit on me and actually change careers because they couldn't ""cure"" me or some shit. So what the hell do I do, anybody can relate?

 Keep me honest am I being an abusive POS? I fucking hate myself and my girlfriend doesn't deserve me. I don't even know why she hasn't left me yet at this point because this is occurrence #15 of times I've blown up at her for these exact same reasons and I can tell it takes a toll on her. I keep wondering there has to be an ulterior motive why she's with me and it keeps feeding into these bullshit loops in my brain. How the hell do I stop and just be grounded in reality?

CPTSD,How will I ever be comfortable around men and children?,192na7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192na7t/how_will_i_ever_be_comfortable_around_men_and/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Radiant_Subject_8322,Radiant_Subject_8322,2024-01-09 19:33:00,How will I ever be comfortable around men and children?,"Trigger warning, this post is going to get into SA/child SA. I myself am never uncomfortable around kids. I was a camp counsellor, spent my adolescence babysitting, am currently a teacher, and have spent a LOT of time with kids. I love them. However, whenever I’m around kids and MEN, I feel like crawling outside of my body I’m so uncomfortable. I read way too much into a man’s every move. I’m so on edge & fearful that they’re attracted to the child. I don’t know how to get over this. I know it stems from my own past and that it’s extremely unfair to paint men as a whole in such a negative light. Yesterday I was spending time with my boyfriend and his best friends daughter (she’s 5 years old). My boyfriend kept grabbing her, tickling her, putting her on his lap, playing with her hair, etc. I couldn’t even look at him. He at one point went into her bedroom alone with her, and even though it was only for a couple minutes, I could barely breathe. The little girl’s father didn’t bat an eye. I’m not a mother, but my history/training with kids is that it is NEVER ok to be that touchy with someone else’s kid unless THE CHILD initiates the touching. He later on said he worries about being seen as a creep, and I said “that didn’t seem to stop you in terms of touching her”, And he got defensive and said this is exactly what he means. I really do trust my boyfriend and I want to get over this but I truly don’t know how. Then I worried that I would never be able to trust my own kid with their father. Have any other women felt similarly and worked through it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’ve been living with the symptoms of what was ultimately diagnosed as cPTSD since I was very young. Compulsive ideation set in when I was just as young. 

I was lucky for a long time, my shambles mess of coping mechanisms helped me keep the desire to self harm away for more years that it ever had a right too. 

Then 2023 happened and holy shit. If you had told me January first that by Halloween I would be homeless and sleeping in my car I would have laughed in your face.

The end of October saw the one final moment of awful that led to homelessness and it fu
lly broke. me my mind saw the opportunity for a quiet exit I made a plan I cleaned up my affairs, no one noticed, right up to the moment one person did. They showed up after I had taken a bunch of pills and begged me to go to a crisis center, I did. After finding out what happened another friend stepped up and offered me a futon in his unfinished basement. Their efforts in those moments meant a lot to me and I decided to try to make things better.

It’s been a couple months now nothing has really changed anything for me, the people talking to me seem to believe that calling the burner phone they got me every couple days and asking me if I applied for jobs is helping me stay accountable. My dad even texted the friend I am staying with and told him that he shouldn’t feel bad if he ultimately decides to kick me out later because it might be the tough love I need. They don’t understand just how badly barely functional I am any more. 

A friend of a friend had a project I might be able to help with asked me to meet for coffee to talk about it. My environmental triggers used to just make my heart rate go up and my hands shake a little something about the people and the noise I had a full on panic attack and started hyperventilating at the table.

The people who say they want to do “anything” to help don’t actually want to do any of the little things that might actually help me. Calling the behavioral health center I got connected to to make appointments and navigating their phone system seems so simple but is now so hard almost impossible I get so flustered.  Instead of asking me why I haven’t sent out resumes someone could have helped me make sure I actually have the appointments I need to supposedly get help.

All I can think lately in the dark moments is how selfish of them to ask me to prolong my pain but then sit here and judge me as I struggle."

Then I found someone who helped me. His kindness woke me up. After that, aged 26 I found out I am neurodivergent (autism).

NOW I feel like a fucking teenager. I am almost 27 and I swear I just hit puberty as the neurodivergent self that I am. I cannot work, this is not a joke and it's terrofying. I spend hours on TikTok watching dog videos while I read science books as a teen.

CPTSD,I'm horrible with kids because I was not able to be one myself. How do I stop feeling insecure over it?,192mcnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192mcnz/im_horrible_with_kids_because_i_was_not_able_to/,https://www.reddit.com/user/CommandNo3498,CommandNo3498,2024-01-09 18:56:10,I'm horrible with kids because I was not able to be one myself. How do I stop feeling insecure over it?,"I am not good with kids whatsoever. I've been told this since I was a kid myself. 

Due to extremely unique circumstances, I was surrounded by adults for pretty much the entirety of my childhood years ( I didn't go to school until fourth/fifth grade) and was always on my best behavior because of this, on top of the fact that I was being abused at home. I didn't get to live my childhood as a child, instead, as an adult in a child's body. 

I have five younger siblings but always treated them as I would a friend/adult(which is all I knew at the time), which prompted my families comments about me being weird around kids. Beyond my younger siblings, there are no young children in my family. It's not that I don't like kids. Kids are great and I really enjoy learning about them. I just don't know how to function around them. I find it hard to operate around anyone really, so it's even harder around beings that are completely foreign to me. 

I don't remember what it was like to be a child, little lone how to operate around one. I get awkward, uncomfortable, annoyed and over-stimulated when I'm around children. I know how to say a kid is cute and that's about it. I took child development courses in college so I'd say I'm pretty well-informed on that but that's about it. I don't know how to hold a baby, I don't know how to talk to toddlers, play with them, get to know them, etc. 

It's become a joke to both my family and even my long-term boyfriend as I've grown. One time, I was offered to hold a really small baby and I felt like I couldn't say no. I was uncomfortable and felt like I was doing it completely wrong. My boyfriend told me he was thinking to himself ""oh god, put it down, put it down"" as it was happening. That made me feel pretty bad about myself even though he assured me that it was just super funny to him. 

Whenever I see women my age with a child, I get really insecure and almost jealous of them. I assume they are all fantastic with children and will be/already are perfect mothers, whereas I assume I will one day be a horrible mother unworthy of her children. Not to mention the generational cycle of abusive mother's in my family.

I really do feel like my 'maternal bone' or whatever it's called was stolen from me as a child. It wasn't something I was born without which makes me not okay with not having it. I'm afraid I'll turn out like my dad, emotionally distant and uninvolved, or worse, my mom. I feel like all odds are stacked against me with parents like that, the fact that I didn't get to spend my childhood being a child, and the fact that I am already uncomfortable around children as it is.

Posted this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/19218gr/comment/kh2om9u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/19218gr/comment/kh2om9u/?context=3)

yesterday and someone mentioned this sounds like enmeshment, and I just started looking into it todau  
  
I don't even know where to start or where this might have began, but basically my entire life has been me afraid to do/ask to do ANYTHING because I am so afraid of what my parents might say. This  isn't like I'm doing anything bad btw, say (hypothetical) if I wanted to take singing classes at like 8, I wouldn't have asked because of the fear that they would have either 1. told me no and embarassed me for having that interest or 2. smothered me with the interest and made it unenjoyable. I don't even really know what I mean by smothering, I almost mean like make them ""too proud"" ??? Like somehow me in this example, singing, would have become their identity too in a way, and I couldn't just do it just to do it?  
  
I was homeschooled by my mother k - 12, and graduated a year early. I was never really good at any community sports so I held myself to a higher degree because I was done early. Then it somehow turned into ""I'm done early and it makes my parents look good because of this."" And ever since it's been that way with everything. I have literally expressed out loud that I do stuff for them because I don't want to make them feel bad/look bad in front of other people, even if it's compromising my wants and needs. For example, my mother runs a youth group with kids I absolutely cannot stand. It is a CHORE beyond belief to be there. I have gone for 9 years and, while recently she has been saying ""you know, you can quit if you want (bc I am 18)"" its never not accompanied with ""How would God feel if you didn't go hangout with these people"" or ""I really wish you would start your own youth group since that was the whole point of me starting this one."" I do ignore her when she says to start my own, but the guilt tripping and knowing how bad it will make her look if her own daughter doesn't come to these events is what keeps me going to them. I know that sounds basic but its just been a LOT of these little things piling up to the point where I do almost whatever she says.  
  
In addition, we are WAY too close. Everywhere I go my parents have to be with me (if not both, my mom at least). Both my parents think they are so incredible for being close with me and my sibling but its to the point where its way too far. Neither of them will go out to eat unless me and my sibling go with them, if my sibling gets out of it, I still go. Shopping is the same way, its all considered ""family time"" as if my whole life hasn't been ""family time"". Comments made from my mother about how ""My daughter just gets me"" and ""My daughter is my best friend"" and so on. All the drama between my parents my mother has vented and complained to me about. I have heard about their sex life in a very strange attempt to give me sex ed. In my last relationship, she had to know every detail of what I did sexually with my ex and STILL ASKS YEARS LATER instead of just leaving it as ""yep she did sexual stuff"". I've asked people I've known if their parents do this regarding sex and they just looked at me dumbfounded, mainly because now I know this does not happen with other people, and mothers do not WANT to know every minute detail to every sexual encounter their kids have ever had.  
  
I know a lot of people will probably wonder why I cave and give her this info, and I've realized exactly where it came from. So in the youth group my mom started (religious) there is a lesson we go over on not lying to your parents which I have no problem with IF its a legitimate thing you have to lie about. There was a period of time where I was cheating on math homework, and after hearing the lesson I came clean to my mom and told her I was sorry. Fair enough. However, at some point it turned into this thing about consistently ""keeping a clear conscience."" Every night turned into me feeling so horrible about every ""bad thought"" I had in my head and I would just tell her everything because i was pressured into doing so. One time I was like 10 and I said ""bitch"" IN MY MIND, not even OUT LOUD, and i had to build up so much courage to ""come clean"" to her about this ""horrible thought"" I had in my head. When I did come up with the courage I was crying to her for quite a bit because I felt so bad about it. I was pretty badly sexually abused for a long period of my life so the intrusive thoughts I have are not normal and I knew should not be shared, but I felt so guilty (???) about not sharing them with her, so I would. this went on for YEARS and I cannot explain the amount of distress I felt NOT telling my mom something that I didn't want or even need to share with her. The problem was, when I would finally get a grip and stop sharing, she would guilt trip with the ""oh you used to be so open with me and you would share every thought you have! You stopped for some reason??? Why??"" The consensus was that CLEARLY, to her, I was hiding something, when no, not every thought I have, you have to know about. But I didn't want her to think I was hiding anything, so the cycle would continue. Literally the definition of 0 boundaries. This went on for a good 4 - 5 years.  
  
I know lying is wrong, and it's not like I want to lie to my mom, but when it comes to a lot of things (ex. sex) I cannot force myself to not share. I don't need to say ""nope never have done anything sexual"" but at the same time every minute detail does not need to be played out as if she was in the room watching.  
  
You will see in my other super long post that it is kind of expected that I don't leave the house. So what's weird is that, for my own wants and needs, I will lie about those, simply because what I say is what they want to hear. That I never want leave the house, I only want to spend time with them, I am happiest with them. Everything I do down to the clothes I wear and stuff I buy is with their permission. Every clothes shopping trip my mom has to come, to make sure she likes the clothes and are appropriate enough for her. Now though I have become codependent on shopping w her because I don't know what clothes fit, she picks them out. And my worst nightmare is coming home with clothes that she won't let me wear because it always turns into ""What kind of girl did I raise to think its okay to wear THAT (the ""that"" in question being a top that comes half a cm over my shorts so my skin shows). If not that, it's also I just have no identity, so I also have to pick out clothes SHE thinks are cute, not me. It's just never ending. I can't tell if this is enmeshment though or me just being a pushover..? Sorry for the embarassingly long post."

I discovered I am in a chronic long term freeze response that is continually reinforced by my constant ruminating of the many situations that gave me CPTSD. I have spent thousands of hours trying to understand what happened to me and the domino effect those things had on my life. But still thinking about stuff  over and over is actually re traumatizing myself and keeping  me in this freeze response. It causes severe anxiety and panic even when I am safe. So  I am going to stop thinking about all the horrible stuff and people. I don't need to figure out any more situations. Im tired of remembering over and over like a time loop. I need to stop that. I need cleanse and purify my mind from those people and allow new good things to fill it. Nothing is easy but understanding chronic freeze response is very helpful. I suppose we can be stuck in any of our trauma responses.

I feel like there's this trend, pretty much everywhere online, of trying to put women and men against each other. It's not cool, it's not right, it's not okay. 

We're all survivors here. We've all survived abuse, from abusers. Their gender doesn't seperate us. I promise, if you're a woman, there are male survivors that you can learn from, talk to, get support from.

I am now 28 and had one a few nights ago, I had a friend who was staying over with me. Whats frustrating is about 5 years ago, the last time she was with me, I also had night terrors. I seem to have them at least once a month, but sometimes I have them multiple times a week and then go through periods of not many (at least, not that I remember). Usually I wake up screaming and the screaming wakes me up. Sometimes I'm screaming because of something I see in the room, such as infestation of bugs or random figures in the room, but then snap out of it and realize there's nothing there. Sometimes the visual is so vivid though and I've had times when my siblings would come running into the room to see what's going on, and I tell them what I see and they see nothing and thats when I realize its just a night terror. I live on my own now though and I fear at this point that I'm just an annoyance to my neighbors.

Does anyone else still experience night terrors as an adult? I seem to experience them similarly to the way a child would, so I am annoyed I still experience them, especially with people around.

•looking at young girls and having intrusive thoughts about them being sexually harmed

•some connections = sex

CPTSD,How to stop bracing for the next trauma?!?!,192kkfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192kkfi/how_to_stop_bracing_for_the_next_trauma/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Wooden_Carrot_8163,Wooden_Carrot_8163,2024-01-09 17:44:25,How to stop bracing for the next trauma?!?!,"Been in a funk for a few days now and it’s been disappointing as I had come into the new year telling myself I was going to focus on creating a wonderful life for myself and focus on my blessings.

Well the last few days I spiraled.

I feel like everything is great right now and after years and years and years of allowing extremely harmful people around me, I’ve become pretty discerning and lowkey. I feel like I’ve done tremendous amount of work on myself and I was optimistic that since my inner world has changed, my outer experiences will reflect that.

Unfortunately, I tend to forget that I still have CPTSD which has never stopped haunting me. 

I spiraled because life has never been SO BEAUTIFUL and instead of being able to stay present for a consistent period of time, I’m just bracing myself for the next trauma OR watching my back.

No matter how much genuine love and support I’ve shown others in the past, what I got in return had been certain people trying to destroy me. 

So now that my life is so peaceful and private, I have this fear at any moment something is going to go wrong.

I broke down tonight. I went to shower for a good cry and then continued my cry on the sofa as I had a 1:1 with sky daddy.

I’m exhausted. Trauma after trauma since birth. Took ages to realize what traits I had that were allowing a lot of shit in my life, took ages to work on those things, took ages to realize I’m highly empathetic and need to be extremely discerning as I tend to attract abusers, users, etc. Healing has been an incredibly long journey and every time I take many leaps forward, I hate myself for feeling pulled backward into unhealthy patterns.

I just wonder with all the love and compassion I’ve given out into the world, when can I expect to receive it back? Or is being an “empath” in this world just supposed to be our job here, to be a light for all these leeches to prey on.

Gave so much of my loving energy to others in my 20s, who pours into us? Yeah I can pour into myself but I have loads of anxiety and paranoia that I struggle with all the time, waiting for shit to go wrong. Who is there to support us when we need a “light” in our lives? Empaths are carrying the world on our backs man and it’s exhausting. Just once I wish I had someone in my corner when shit felt really heavy to hold me and tell me everything was gonna be ok and I’m safe. I’ve always been the cheerleader for others. It’s sad that I can’t really think of anyone in my life that I can talk to about my struggles."

I remember my idealistic childhood, encircling my parents’ controlling volatility in a hope that one day I would be treated with the respect that didn’t seem to exist off book in my little suburb of Ohio. 
 I was raped at a catholic university in Saint Louis when i was 19 by an acquaintance. I had lots of friends, was doing well in school in spite of a penchant for self harm and an obsession with art, calculus, and chemistry that wouldn’t quit and lingering depression. I met a guy on my floor and we just clicked really well and he liked the same movies as me and we would walk together and make each other laugh like buddies even though we both had girlfriends. 
I was ashamed, disgusted, and embarrassed by myself, my experience with rape and mundane abuse. I felt radioactive, like anything I touched would decay in my presence, stripped of structural stability. I waited 9 years to find this guy again so I could figure it out and come out proud and not dysphoric. At 28 I feel hopeful, integrated, and far safer than before I did all the work to find that within myself. 
I was so happy about this I got atypical antipsychotic meds because I always worry it’s empirically not been as nice as I expect it to be. I think a healthy relationship is just about being loving in your actions and words and never turning on your chosen family because they’ve been vetted by the hypervigilant parts of us and can be trusted.

most recently moved from my house at school to live with a friend and her family. this brought back a lot of things i struggled with at home with my parents. i’ve fallen into a constant state of anxiety, worrying about things like leaving my room, cooking in the kitchen, showering etc. (they are very wonderful people, it’s just me struggling being in someone else’s space). 

i have two options when i move again and i keep getting so hung up on which will feel better for me. i currently live relatively close to some friends and family and my first option isn’t much further away. the only problem i see is that i would be living alone. i still have a lot of my trauma to work through and while i can very much see that having the space to do that would be helpful, i feel so overwhelmingly alone sometimes. 

my other option is to stay with family, but it’s almost two hours away from where i am now and a good hour+ from my job. my family there is sweet and supportive and i think could help to heal some of my parental wounds. i just get worried about not being close to the rest of my support system, putting more strain on my already-falling-apart car and maybe continuing the cycle of fear in someone else’s home. 

i guess my question with this is what would you do? or what have you done in your own journey in relation to moving? how did you manage and make it feel better?"

It's weighing on me so badly, how sad I am for him. How sad I am that he still lives with his parents, still has to go back to them every day. They beat their kids. They scream at them. Call them names. Curse them out. They expect their kids to run the household. Do all the chores, keep things running, take care of their baby brother, shut up, don't complain, if you've got a problem with it get a job and get out.

And I've witnessed half this shit myself. My trauma responses are fawning and freezing and even if they weren't, speaking up to abusive parents only ever makes things worse. So you can imagine how utterly fucking useless I feel when I'm listening to his younger sister get cussed out, or watching his mom hit his younger brother's knuckles with a spatula, or watching *him* defend himself from his mom trying to fight him. In front of me. And I just have to stay out of it. Or, god forbid, pretend this is totally fine and normal and I'm unfazed, when in reality I'm fighting back tears.

I am so, so sad. Because I know he can't think too hard about how shitty of a situation it really is or it'll start feeling a lot shittier too, so I can't tell him the full extent of how horrible his parents are. I can't tell him how awful I feel when I hold him close and I run my hands over his back and I wonder how many times he's been beaten there. I can't tell him I hate that bruises don't show on his dark skin because then I never know how bad it gets, how many marks are hidden. I can't tell him that every time I see a belt or hear the buckle jingle I think about how he's been beaten with that before. And when I tell him a small portion of how sad it makes me, he asks ""why?"" and I hate, hate, hate that I know that feeling all too well. Because the full question is ""why do you care? Why does it matter if I'm hurt? Does it really matter?"" And I've felt that same way so many times thanks to my emotionally neglectful parents and I *hate* that he does too, because his parents have taught him that being hit is okay.

Taking him home every day feels like I'm sending him to prison. I am walking him directly to his abusers. To be yelled at and threatened and hit and parentified. And I have no fucking choice but to allow him to be subjected to this, and he has no fucking choice but to accept it and do what he's told.

I am so, so, so fucking sad."

CPTSD,My Journey Through Abuse and Discovering Healthy Relationships,192hdee,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192hdee/my_journey_through_abuse_and_discovering_healthy/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Nouretwys,Nouretwys,2024-01-09 15:33:54,My Journey Through Abuse and Discovering Healthy Relationships,"Hey everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a significant part of my journey that has been both transformative and challenging. I'm a 25-year-old woman who has walked a path marked by enduring a lifetime of abuse from various individuals, ranging from those I held closest to my heart to people I barely knew. It's a journey that's left indelible imprints on my life, shaping my choices and perspectives in ways I'm only recently coming to understand.

For the longest time, the true toll this abuse took on my body and mind eluded me. There were moments when I found myself grappling with chronic illnesses and unexplained health issues, leaving me feeling inexplicably unwell. It took me a while to connect the dots, but I began to realize that these physical challenges were intricately tied to the intense stress and trauma resulting from the abuse I endured. The emotional scars ran deep, but the physical manifestations were a stark reminder of the turmoil within.

Moreover, this trauma had a profound impact on my emotional and psychological well-being. Accepting love, kindness, or help from others became an arduous task. The feeling of unworthiness and undeservingness was overpowering, leading me to retreat and isolate myself. It became difficult to fathom why anyone would want to extend care or support to someone like me. This struggle with accepting love and care made me withdraw further, unintentionally pushing away those who genuinely cared about me. I found myself caught in a vicious cycle of feeling undeserving and then feeling guilty for not being able to reciprocate or express gratitude adequately.

Additionally, in an attempt to protect myself from the abuse, I often made choices that degraded the quality of my life. It was a downhill journey where I consistently opted for what seemed like the least damaging choices at the time, only to realize later that they compounded into a series of detrimental decisions.

This realization, while empowering in understanding the root cause of certain behaviors, was also saddening. It highlighted the depth to which past trauma had impacted my sense of self-worth, self-prioritization, and ability to accept love and care from others.

Since abuse became my normalcy, I unknowingly welcomed and even sought out abusive people into my life until the damaging effects became apparent. I found myself overly stunned and in awe of healthy individuals and environments, having lived in a hellish existence for far too long. It felt beyond luxury, almost heavenly, encountering healthy relationships and environments. Questions flooded my mind: How can people live this way? How can they communicate gently and resolve conflicts healthily? How can they have healthy problems?

It's been a journey of discovering the stark contrast between the unhealthy environment I was accustomed to and the possibility of healthy relationships and interactions. As I've ventured into my healing journey and prioritized self-care and self-discovery, I've begun to understand that healthy environments are not a rarity but a necessity for my well-being.

Sharing this part of my journey is not only a means of reflection but also an opportunity to connect with others who might relate to these experiences or have insights to share.

Thank you all for your support, understanding, and the willingness to share your wisdom."

CPTSD,The financial inaccessibility of housing traps people in abuse and I will never stop being angry about it,192h1qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192h1qr/the_financial_inaccessibility_of_housing_traps/,https://www.reddit.com/user/MeanwhileOnPluto,MeanwhileOnPluto,2024-01-09 15:19:29,The financial inaccessibility of housing traps people in abuse and I will never stop being angry about it,"I've posted and commented about this here before but still, I regularly need like.. some kind of catharsis for this because it seems like now that I'm housed im supposed to just be ""fine now"". Cool, not like I run on fear or anything. Not like the fear of losing my housing again comes screaming back whenever i make the tiniest mistake at my job, the thing that enables me to have the ""privelege"" of housing. And of course, I *don't* have to worry about complete mental breakdowns every time I have to move (which is yearly due to rising rents) because it feels like my home is being ripped away from me again and again. Good thing that I don't have to deal with any of that at all, because. Gee. Wow. That would suck!

For context, I'm coming from a US perspective. Housing is inaccessible in a lot of other places too though. (It's just that I don't know enough about how it is in other parts of the world to be justified in talking about them.)

Right. So I'm angry. I'm always angry about this. Between financial abuse, the aftereffects (and compounding) of trauma, and some shit economic circumstances, I've been pretty poor for the last decade or so, which means I'm also very familiar with housing insecurity. I was also shelter homeless in 2022 and car+couchsurfing homeless at some point in the 2010s. There are different tiers of homelessness and the fact that I was able to get out at all speaks to the fact that I was on a higher ""tier"" (ie. I literally just had more luck) than those who couldn't. And hey, isn't that fucked up? Super fucked up!

A lot of abusers tell you that you're not worthy of food or housing or compassion or support. The fact that housing is commodified and homeless people are completely dehumanized just doubles down on that. I want to shake the entire thing and scream about how much that's just compounding the trauma of being told and shown and believing that you, a human being, are not worthy of a safe, quiet place to sleep. Jesus christ. I remember when I was in the shelter and trying so hard not to internalize that me being homeless meant there was something *wrong* with me, because I was surrounded by it and that, oh, how had I fucked up so badly as to lose my housing? (Whoops, sorry I had to escape my abusive father with no money!! Totally my bad)

Imagine if housing was not behind a paywall. Imagine how many people's lives that would change. I fucking just think about it sometimes and I feel sick to my stomach. Imagine if we had *some* kind of thing that would get people out of abusive situations without thrusting them into the abandonment hell of homelessness. I mean, fuck, imagine if we just... didn't dehumanize people for not having homes. But people get stuck with shitty landlords who know that they have power over someone's whole fucking world, people get stuck in dangerous relationships and with family members who hurt then.

And I'm not saying that housing is the only thing keeping people trapped in abuse. It's not. But its a big fucking barrier nonetheless. I'd say about 80-90% of the people in that shelter I was in had a history of some kind of relational abuse. At least. It wasn't a DV shelter. Isn't it funny how that works out? You're low on options for housing (and this can be for a whole host of reasons) and all your options are bad, so you have to stay in the bad option for longer than you would ever choose to otherwise. I'm just.

I hate it. I'm so tired of hearing my coworkers talk about homeless people and I'm so tired of being afraid that it'll happen to me again because I know how this shit becomes chronic. Familial poverty+financial poverty. Both of those together puts you in a vulnerable place. God fucking forbid you have any kind of disability.

Not everyone can rely on their family as a safe source of housing. Actually, a lot of people can't! And yet, is there any other option that isn't ""have enough money""? No?

Fuck, man. I'm just so angry."

It was sudden - this summer I just literally left and said I can't do this anymore.

Since then I show up to therapy each time and my question is ""What the hell happened to me?""

This week, my therapist said, I think your husband's substance use is important to consider.

And bam. A lightbulb went off.

I just got my diagnosis of CPTSD recently, and I was able to put the pieces together. For the bulk of our marriage, my husband was my rock. Safe. Calm. Loving. No substance use (weed, alcohol) for either of us as we both didn't like it.

And after growing up in a home with a violent alcoholic father who also smoked weed my husband was a refuge.

During covid, he started smoking weed, and it creeped me out. That's the best way I can describe how I felt. His eyes would change, his tone of voice would change, and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Now, I don't have an issue with weed - for other people. But for me, I now understand it was involved in my trauma, and having my safe person alter their headspace triggered me so hard.

I told him I felt uncomfortable and asked him to stop. To try therapy. To figure out why he was using to cope. He said he would get rid of it, but then I found his stash the next week. It was the first time in our life together he had lied to me.

I kept telling myself it was okay. It was legal. Other people did it, so why did I have such a problem with it? But my diagnosis and my history now allows me to see that his using triggered me.

It kept on, until this summer when we had a fight that just brought me back to the place I was when I was a kid, with all the anger and crying and pleading.

And a few days later I left.

I couldn't connect the dots. But the year he was using consistently retraumatized me. And I coped by flighting - as I always had before. I ran away.

&#x200B;

And it's taken me six months of being away from my home, six months of being villainized by the people I love, to realize that my fucking trauma (and I am talking serious repeated trauma at the hands of my dad all the way through college and meeting my husband) ruined my life.

I wrote my husband a letter to try and explain my actions. And I met with my mother in law to talk to her to.

She was so angry and told me to stop being a victim. That I am always the victim and her precious son did nothing wrong.

""I believe you,"" she said about my trauma when I explained to her. ""I believe you"" she said when I explained CPTSD. And it made me so angry because if I had said I had cancer, would she say ""I believe you""? Or would she say ""Oh my God, what's the treatment plan? What's the prognosis?""

It just feels impossible to explain to people how the trauma we experienced throughout our lives can manifest in ways that don't make sense to the outside world. How we've learned to cope in ways that don't align with the ""normal"" world. Disproportionate to the situation when looked at through the lens of ""normal"" responses.

Of course when my safe person began resembling the man who traumatized me, I acted in a response that was intense. No one could understand why - not even ME. Until therapy helped me connect the dots.

I don't know why I am writing this. Mostly just to say it's been incredibly hard to watch my life fall apart because I am a messed up person from things that happened to me that I had no control over.

I've worked for years in therapy to try and heal. I thought I had done a good job. But no one had given me the diagnosis in all that work. And I just thought ""Oh, I had a messed up childhood. But that was then and this is now.""

No. The body remembers. It remembers and it will fuck your shit up.

So that's my story. I feel like I'm not worth anything anymore. Like I am damaged beyond repair and I have ruined my life because of this stupid bullshit that I don't think I'll ever get better from.

I hate myself today. And I am angry at the world. And at people who don't understand what it's like to grow up afraid, beaten, emotionally terrorized, and in constant anguish. That I should just stop ""being the victim.""

Believe me, I really wish I could.

Edit: I would just like to add that the responses to this post have been a lifeline for me today. Each one, even the ones that have me confronting uncomfortable things about myself. But the love and ... the understanding ... is something I've never felt in my life. I have a group of people now. When I have always just felt so alone and weird and not like everyone else. So thank you for hearing me, and for all of the things you've shared. I don't post online because I always delete and feel stupid. But I am glad I did today. It's saving my life.

For context I'm 21f and friend is 23f.

I moved in with a fairly good friend of mine back in September after many years of living alone, mainly so it would be financially easier on us both to split expenses, but also because I thought living with another person might be good for me. I got diagnosed with CPTSD a couple weeks before Christmas, though initially my previous therapist suspected something in the realm of personality disorders (BPD and the likes). I informed my friend of this fact before we decided to move in together, as I have a tendency to self-isolate and struggle to regulate my emotions (like many of us do). It didn't deter her, and we've generally had a good start, with some bumps in the road here and there. I care for her very deeply, and she was one of the few people I could imagine actually living with.

Last year was probably the most difficult year of my life so far, and without going into detail it entailed a lot of triggering of old trauma and creating new trauma. Basically, a lot of bad shit happened and I was a total wreck until August/September. My friend/roommate knows some of my history, enough to explain why I might act the way I do sometimes, and knows very well what 2023 was like for me.

Despite us being in completely different places right now, I am truly happy for her that things in her life are going well, that she seems to be genuinely happy and in a good spot. She got a boyfriend recently who seems to be a great guy, she has friends and is going to school, doing something she enjoys. I feels like she keeps a lot of her personal life private from me, which is a little hurtful but completely in her right, but it also feels like she only wants to engage in conversations that are ""positive"" in nature. I feel like she isn't interested in really hearing about my day when she asks, because the times I've admitted I'm not doing so good, she doesn't really say anything other than ""oh"" and moves on to do something else until a different, ""positive"" topic comes up.

I feel really stupid for saying this, but it feels like the only thing she cares about is her own wants, needs and feelings, and that I'm ruining her ""vibe"" by not also having a good time like she is. This was upsetting but manageable for some time.

 (As a sidenote, some time ago she started preaching the idea that everyone should just mind their own business and not get invovled with what other people are doing, to a somewhat extreme extent (like that other countries should not get invovled in other countries' conflicts). Maybe she is trying to practice what she preaches? But then I don't understand how caring about your close friend is butting into their business?)

I did grow a little resentful, and that feeling intensified tenfold after my father put me through another trauma over Christmas break. I was out of the country when it happened, and I was able to keep it together for a few days because I had to face him and the rest of my family, but after coming home I feel like any progress I made this autumn is completely gone. 

I hinted to the fact that something had happened while I was away relating to my father,  but because it was New Years Eve and we didn't have much time before going out I kept it very brief, but she never asked me about it again. Now that I'm home I feel so hollow and angry and devastated on the inside, and being around her and seeing how good she has it is destroying me. I'm so envious of how easily she got out of her struggles, how quickly it happened, how she is able to bounce back from terrible things so easily. How seemingly my life is a constant downward spiral, while hers was a bump in the road with bountiful rewards on the other side? I'm so hurt that she doesn't see me, that she doesn't seem to care about anything else than her happy life. If the situation was flipped, I would at least have tried to help in some way, ask if she wants to hang out, ask her if she wants to talk, but when I've needed her she isn't really there.

I know it's not her fault that my life is what it is, and her losing all the good things wouldn't make my life any better, but god, I'm so fucking angry at her and I'm even more ashamed of that anger. It got to the point where seeing her makes my stomach feel like it's being torn apart, and in an effort to not take out that anger on her in a destructive way (yell, say hurtful things), I've shut her out completely. Whenever she is home I can't even form a sentence, I can't bring myself to even try to pretend that I'm fine, but by going cold I did exactly what I didn't want to do and taken that anger out on her anyway, just in a different format. She has asked me if I'm fine and if she's done something, and I said yes and no respectively, because how do I even begin to even attempt to explain why I'm cold and quiet all of a sudden? How am I supposed to say that hearing her say ""Ah, things are just so wonderful right now!"" feels like direct mockery and insult of my situation? I can't bring myself to beg someone to care about me again. I also feel like I can't be vulnerable right now, in any way.

I'm torn between feeling like wanting her to care enough to ask and offer emotional support is embarassing and needy and not my place, and wanting it so badly from just SOMEONE, especially someone who knows I'm struggling. I have literally no idea what I'm ""allowed"" to ask for in a friendship, and it's not her job to comfort me, and I feel like a total asshole and idiot for wanting it. Am I completely fucking broken for feeling that way? I feel like my brain is going to implode if I try to figure this out on my own any longer. I've spent nearly a week now trying to figure out what the hell to do and I have come up with nothing. Is she a bad friend? Am I a bad friend? Am I crazy?

I don't even know what I'm angry about at this point, I'm just angry when I see her or think about the situation. She has been avoiding being home the last few days, which is understandable, but it also just makes me angrier. 

If anyone has any insight or advice or literally anything at all I would be insanely grateful. I'm at a complete loss."

I just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has had something inf similar . 

Over the past two months , I’ve been really struggling with severe C- PTSD symptoms and of course not making progress in therapy . We are all familiar with Anna Runkle . Given that her stuff is far more out of reach , I wanted to see how accessible “ Over coming PTSD “ was . 

I went to their website , signed up for a day to schedule a consultation. There’s a video at the end of the sign up process . I watched it . The next day I waited for the phone call around noon as that’s when I scheduled it . No one called . I signed up for another time and waited again . The apt had been canceled with out my knowledge ege until receiving an automated cancellation email by the owners . 

I started to receive emails from the husband , Brad . Of course all automated. They were mostly about how I was feeling , any way I can support you , how are your symptoms , ect . 

Basically, I’m not impressed . There was no communication. The emails made me feel uncomfortable. They were extremely intense , emotional emails that triggered me . I of course unsubscribed and blocked Brads emails, because they were still coming through after unsubscribing. I feel like they are another scam .

 It feels more geared towards people with PTSD , even though Amy and Brad say they can “ cure “  CPTSD . Neither are of course in the mental health field . They both claim they have CPTSD and have cured each other . Along , with people in their community . 

It was a weird experience and I’m trusting my gut on it . I believe their intentions are mostly , good and I hope they really do help some people . I hope they are not making profit off other peoples misery . We are easy targets for hope to rid ourselves of this vile thing .  

If anyone would like to share their experience, please feel free .

EDIT : I was cleaning out my spam folder and found and email from Brad saying "" I'm sorry , but you don't meet out qualifications at this time . Please, refer to my Youtube Channel and Podcast on all the tools, ect "" . I'm going to say it's because I can't generate income for them .I found a few more of his emails and they were your usual , ""Wow ! This client cured there 30 year long PTSD in 30 days ! Obviously , this wont work for everyone , but HE DID IT AND SO CAN YOU ! "", Bullshit .  I'm not surprised , but I am saddened that they are part of the problem, rather the solution and have given into greed like so many people out there . I wish people like this could get banned from making content ad filtered out . I just hate this profit over helping people mentality that is killing people for no good reason . This is why so many of us stop trusting , live short lives, and stop connecting . Fuq you Amy and Brad . Fuq you ."

I am bored a lot, I feel hopeless and helpless a lot. It's really only alleviated by nice interactions where I learn things and people are pleased to show me.

However, my boss really rubs me up the wrong way. She's the same age as me, 40s, so no spring chickens both. However, she takes a superior attitude over me and corrects my work (and others) pedantically. It's her way or the highway. Now this would be normal and fine, but she speaks to me like I am an idiot. I have just as much experience in the job as she does, she is just a little miss perfect about it whereas I can handle a little slop if we get the right results. This causes friction as I get sick of being corrected by her. So, she spoke out rudely to me in two meetings, and I snapped. I asked to speak to her on a call, in the presence of two of her trusted colleagues and I told her. I told her I was sick of being talked down to and corrected, instead of helped and instructed. She suddenly got all upset and asked why I was attacking her. So I guess she doesn't realise that she's speaking to people the way she does. She also doesn't seem to realise that things don't have to be regimental and disciplinarian to get things done. Anyway, it's turned into a big incident, I was upset, she was upset, and I was reported to HR. The ""investigation"" is on-going, but I know the other two on the call will throw me under the bus for her. One of them has taken already up her role of questioning me as hard as possible.

I entered my first relationship a few months ago, pretty late in my life (I'm 30). I thought I was ready but it turned out kissing is triggering, touching is triggering, and I didn't really think ahead on how to show affection when you avoid touch. So I'm dumbly sitting in this relationship wondering why she's staying. 

But I refused to go down this rabbit hole, so I thought I would trust that she knows what she's doing and she would break up if I do make her feel unappreciated and unhappy.

It turns out I was wrong, I think. She does feel unloved and doesn't trust that I like her at all, so I asked her to tell me what would make her feel loved that I could do. She avoided the question once, telling me she didn't know. So I insisted and told her I'd wait for her answer. And then she recited a few things I did that she liked. But that doesn't answer my question, because if I really did things right then she wouldn't feel this way. So basically, there's nothing I can do? 

She told me she had low confidence and I fear that it's just deeply incompatible with my own issues.

I don't know... I want to hope but I just don't know what to do."
CPTSD,"I'm terrified of teenagers due to bullying, it was getting better then something happened",192caf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/192caf0/im_terrified_of_teenagers_due_to_bullying_it_was/,https://www.reddit.com/user/kacctuss,kacctuss,2024-01-09 11:07:14,"I'm terrified of teenagers due to bullying, it was getting better then something happened","TRIGGER WARNING: emotional Abuse

I grew up in a tiny village with no high school. The school I went to had very few kids so I didn't have many friends, and the friends I did have moved to the city to attend high school. I was forced to go to high school in the nearest village where my abusive parent was a teacher. He taught my class for a couple of years, which I remember as the worst years of my life.

I was bullied because I arrived with no friends and no former classmates, plus my abuser being our teacher. The kids would hide my school bag, laugh at me when I was asked a question by a teacher in class, would always be picked last in PE, hit me and push me in the corridors. I had a personal bully, she would mock me and pull at my hair in PE when nobody was looking. I did get some revenge on her later on.

The first year I tried telling my mother what was happening. I wasn't aware I was being bullied because I normalised it since I had an abuser at home and thought I just deserved it. I told her while crying that I was depressed, the kids weren't treating me nicely, and that I wanted to switch schools. Her answer was: ""I hated school too, the kids also treated me poorly, I cried every day because of it. I'm sorry, you just have to pull through."" And that was the end of it. I accepted it because my mother was never supportive, never protected me from my abuser, in fact she taught me to be abused, so I was used to her treason. 

I told my abusive parent later in life when I was aware he was an abuser. He laughed in my face and gaslight the fuck out of me saying it wasn't that bad and my memory was playing tricks on me. Joke's on him, not only was he a TERRIBLE parent but also a terrible teacher. His daughter had been bullied right under his nose. 

After much therapy I was getting better in regards to my fear of teenagers, but then something happened a few weeks ago. I was on a walk in a park with a new friend and we passed a group of +15 teenage boys. We had avoided them previously because in my country big teenage male groups are on the rise and more cases of rape and crimes by them are being reported. But we couldn't avoid the group again so we went past them with the biggest distance possible. As I was walking past them I noticed something warm and wet land on my bare arm. I instantly froze without looking at it and continued walking as if nothing until I got to a bin 50 meters from the incident. I got a tissue out to whipe it off and that's when I looked at it. I don't know if it was saliva or cum. The ammount of it makes me think the latter. When I started cleaning it, I heard the group instantly laughing. I didn't look back. I don't know what it was, since it's common for people to spit where I live and it could have been an accident. I don't know if they were laughing at me since I didn't look back. 

Whatever it was and whatever happened, I got triggered again. I know I'm never going to let my guard down around teenagers again. This sucks, since avoiding teenagers and being alert on the streets in broad daylight is so bad for ptsd. "

Growing up I never understood why she had to leave. My memory was and still is very patchy. But sometimes she would come back to terrorize our house and I slowly started to understand why she had to go. Physically abusive and manipulative with her words. I received a lot of “I love yous” from my mom but she would get really mad at us kids or punch my dad, grandma, or grandpa. She would convince me that dad was the bad guy. I barely remember all the things she did but I do know that I grew up walking on egg shells developed anxiety and depression and other things that I struggle to this day with. She cuts off contact with us due to not wanting to be found. But I do know her Facebook page. She was recently hospitalized from a stroke.

Or what my life would’ve been if she was mentally stable. I miss her. I hate her. I wish she could’ve been there for me. I don’t know. I’m confused. I’m numb, sad, and angry.

I can stop dead in my tracks and just stand and give a thousand yard stare and look like I’m completely spaced out, but I don’t even register what I’m physically looking at; all I can see is the memory I’m thinking about. These memories are extremely vivid, but I’m still in control; I know that it’s just a memory, and I could stop these memories midway through in my head if I want to. It does really feel like I’m taking a brief step out of reality for a moment, so it might be a form of dissociation. A lot of times, it just feels like I’m vividly dwelling on past experiences. If I had to wager a guess, I think the experiences I dwell on have some sort of emotional potency; they can be good, bad, sad, embarrassing, etc. I’m just curious if this is some sort of commonality under some area of the CPTSD umbrella. When I have a really bad moment, like where I did something utterly stupid or mortifying, I absolutely will not be able to stop replaying the events in my mind; remembering the sights, the sounds, the people involved, those things are stuck in my head. Maybe I just have a very episodic memory; maybe I just have an introspective mind, but I have a lot of other CPTSD symptoms as well, so it doesn’t seem totally unreasonable to think these things might be related.

Anyone else here do this too?"

I wanted to tell the guy an important part of my history that wasn't covered in the last part. A factor into why it's so difficult for me to work... and I knew the consequences of talking about it. Nightmares. Crying. Unable to sleep at all. Images as soon as I close my eyes. Flipping from being shaken but fine to sobbing uncontrollably. This happens every time I tell someone about what happened... but it was so important to me that it was written down, and now I'm stuck facing the consequences of it.


I'm just so tired about the fact that talking about something makes everything so much worse for days."

So I'm using this space to practice articulated where I'm at but I'm also looking to hear about other people's stories and experiences processing sex and shame around sexuality.

I'm just realizing how much sexual shame I carry.  I put a trigger warning on this because of the sexual abuse I experienced as a kid (mostly limited to sexually inappropriate comments throughout my childhood by my dad, and groping by my dad, inappropriate objectification by my dad and step-dad, and growing up in a religion that was super restrictive around sex).

I am totally out of touch with who I am or what I want sexually.  I find that my way of managing this is to attempt to micro-manage my partner's sexuality and also to always say yes to whatever he wants, whenever he wants it.  Goodness, as I write this, I realize that of course I want to manage his sexuality and needs - because I have no boundaries (and no idea of where my boundaries are) and so I have to control him so that he doesn't ask me for something I can't or don't want to manage.  

Maybe, what I'm trying to figure out... but am so far from getting to... is allowing and accepting my sexual boundaries and welcoming my sexual desires.  How in the fuck do you do that?  I have literally no idea and am terrified of any sexual preferences or desires I have.

Told him I was thinking of deferring my study to focus on myself for a bit (context: I’m in my final year and I hate this programme but I dont wanna drop out since it would be a waste of the first 4 years I tried to tough it out). Dr said I can try some new meds for a few weeks and then think about it because it’s helped his past patients who thought of quitting their jobs. So I agreed. 

 My dad usually goes in after me to talk about what I discussed with my psych. It probably sounds weird but this is the compromise we decided on since he pays for my meds. Idk what he heard or if he misunderstood my Dr but he wont shut up about how I dont care about his happiness and he’s threatening to drive into other cars n shit.

I want to keep making out and see where it goes because I really like her. When seeing someone new and sexual intimacy is being led up to, my body starts shaking and convulsing when I’m making out with someone because of my SA history. 

SA happened in 2010-2011 and it’s happened with all three sexual partners I’ve had since. I hate having to even explain it and let people know so I usually don’t and just push through but then I end up feeling violated. So I want to tell this person so she can be aware and so I can feel safe. But I am really scared because last time I told this to a girl I was seeing she freaked out thinking I was a fragile baby and ended things. 

Anyone ever had to do this before? I am scared it’ll make me seem really damaged and fragile and she won’t want to see me anymore. She knows I’ve had some history of assault as I’ve mentioned being in an abusive relo as a teen."

The landlord seemed pretty nice, but red flags started right away.  A recent double murder in the parking lot at my last apartment meant that in this housing market anywhere safer was better. 

We made some flaky deals that meant I was doing things tenants don’t do. Painting ,cleaning long neglected common areas, washing windows … I was stuck in fawn mode, so I was bending over backwards to try and get the landlord to like me I guess. 

Couple months later,  trying to get him to schedule a bug treatment it’s going HORRIBLY.  Today it evolved into a shouting match. It was a dumpster fire. He decides that okay now is the time, if I’m going to be such a pain in the ass about it. Like okay, but that’s what I’ve been asking you to do since November and suddenly you’re inspired. 
He got all aggressive saying something about my dog is going to die and it’s going to be his fault, then opened my kitchen cupboard and started to spray roach spray on my food?  I yelled at him not to  spray poison on my food he yelled at me to empty the cupboard.  We did not have an appointment for this treatment, or I would have prepared. 

It’s fucking bad. I did what I was told, thank you dysfunctional brain. Then I grabbed my keys and my dog and literally ran out the door. I didn’t even get a jacket and it’s wintertime where I live.   We sent a flurry of stupid texts. I resorted to almost begging him to be reasonable. The shame is killing me. I was only asking him to do the things he either said he would do or Is legally obligated to do. 

He triggered me. I didn’t have a panic attack, small miracle. I am so triggered that I have been shaking for more than 12 hours and I can’t even eat or  drink water.   I came home but it’s after three in the morning and I’m sitting on the couch with all the lights on, my shoes on and ready to bolt.  I can’t come down. I’ve tried my self soothing stuff but I think I broke something. It’s just been too much for too long. 

Also he just comes banging on the door when he’s in the building which seemed okay until this happened and now I don’t feel safe. I want to abandon everything and run. I have done that multiple times, when I was an abused child I ran away. When I was an abused wife I ran away. When I got abducted from my home I didn’t run away but I wound up abandoning it and putting all my things in storage for literally a couple years while I put myself back together. So much of my trauma revolves around having a safe home.

So I’m wondering if others are like this? It’s not my landlord’s fault that all this other shit happened to me. And now I think I ruined this new living situation. Fuck. Now what?"
CPTSD,"i don't know if my boyfriend believes me, and its making me doubt my experiences",1929m1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1929m1z/i_dont_know_if_my_boyfriend_believes_me_and_its/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Same-Owl-5811,Same-Owl-5811,2024-01-09 08:01:04,"i don't know if my boyfriend believes me, and its making me doubt my experiences","as a disclaimer, my boyfriend is incredible. he's hands down the best person i have ever met. he is sweet, considerate, patient, funny, unconditionally loving, and everything else you could ever possibly want in a partner. i have been in an abusive relationship, and this is not that. everyday, i fear that he is like those who have hurt me, but he's not. I think that fear alone drives the majority of my anxious thoughts about him.

Basically, the first few times I cried in front of my boyfriend, he was the sweetest thing in the world. He was incredibly gentle and understanding, and listened to me talk. Little did he know what he was getting himself into. I cry a lot, over things that don't make any sense to him. He'll use a verbal tone he thinks is normal only for me to start tearing up and shut down. We've been dating for almost two years, and after all that time, I can't imagine how frustrating it is to have to constantly deal with my crying spells. A lot of the time, during these crying spells, I'll talk a lot, just spewing shit out, trying to somehow explain to him why I'm like this. He has done things that hurt me, but not anything that is ""objectively"" painful:

For example, he told me he had ordered a birthday gift for me, but never did. Lying is one of my biggest triggers, so I think about that a lot. He would play video games for hours, making me feel ignored, but we solved that pretty quickly. While he's playing video games, he will use angry language that makes me scared (my dad is 6'2"", terrifying huge biting voice when he's angry). Little things, all things that I weigh in my head everyday, knowing that they're not that big of a deal, but nevertheless i toil in my mind all the time trying to figure out if he's going to hurt me really badly one day. I'm convinced he thinks I'm stupid because sometimes he uses a tone that sounds like that. I have these kinds of delusional thinking. Though I know they're probably delusional, I ruminate and ruminate all the fucking time weighing all these things. Forgot to mention i suspect i have pure OCD. I do most of the cleaning, and a lot of my recent crying spells have been about feeling taken advantage of because of that, and i get really overwhelmed when things are too messy. Btw, my idea of what is clean is not that intense, and im DEFINITELY not the tidiest person in the world lol. When my crying is about him, he will turn it onto himself and sometimes start crying and ask me if im breaking up with him. Then I reassure him that it's okay and that I'm not going to do that. I don't mind doing this, but this has happened so many times and I feel like the issue isn't getting solved because I'm so scared of his emotions. I still do most of the cleaning lol.

When we were planning our trip home for the holidays (we're college students) I wanted to return to our apartment a week before the semester started because I don't like living with my family. Since my boyfriend's dad was kindly arranging the flight, I asked him to ask if we could plan for that week early return home. Didn't happen, even though he said he would ask. The few days before the flight back, I was anxious and in tears all the time. He said he'd schedule it for a week earlier, and his dad agreed, but then my boyfriend started crying because he didn't want his parents to think that he didn't want to spend time with him. May I mention that his family is like. Super oddly healthy? they are amazing, and I love them, so I told him to keep the original time. I consistently sacrifice my own emotions for his, which I'm happy to do, but I have no evidence that he would do the same for me. and that scares the living shit out of me.

Recently, when I start crying for whatever reason, he seems like he cares less about it than he used to. compared to when we first started dating, he seems much less scared to hurt me... while im still relatively the same level of sensitive, although ive definitely gotten better in the last few months. I have this weird sense that he's more frustrated, that he listens less. I worry now that he doesn't listen at all, even though I have no proof of that. sometimes when i imply im sad he'll go ""oh no"" or ""oh god"" and he sounds sweet saying it, but i have this insane deep dread and guilt that i am fraying him down. Last week, I was crying to him really hard, and I realized after saying a little anecdote about my family, it didn't sound as bad out loud as the emotions I was feeling. I expressed this and he agreed, but said that all the little things compounded were hurtful. Whenever i try to bring up trauma, I feel like he shrinks away a little bit... like he doesn't seem to fully believe me? I desperately want him to, because I feel like it would explain my behavior, but whenever I try i feel like it just falls flat. there's so much i don't remember.

I've been doubting whether I really went through anything at all in these 19 years of my life. In terms of mental health, I'm much better than I was just a couple years ago. My family life is better too... not perfect, but better. no more daily screaming between my mom and sister. My mom especially has become such a bright, funny, spunky woman and I think she's great. My relationship with her is my most complicated. I find myself unhurt by things that would have hurt me a few years ago, especially when its my parents doing it, but so so so hurt by tiny things my boyfriend, or even random strangers do, that make me wonder what the hell is wrong with me... shouldn't my family make me hurt the most? they used to, but now it's like everything is switched.

i think maybe its that my boyfriend has shown me the most unconditional love ive ever known, and im so terrified that its not real. if i can catch it before it catches up to me, then the lack of surprise will make it hurt less. i know all these things. ive analyzed myself inside and out. ive made progress. i spend most of my mental energy analyzing myself, thinking about my reactions and why they happen, adjusting my outward reactions, thinking about what i say, etc. i am by no means someone who doesn't know they have issues and takes it out on his boyfriend all the time with these crying spells. i just have these reactions that i wish so so badly i could control...or explain better. ive explained so fucking much, so why don't i feel like he believes me? why do i still feel a wall, despite how much of myself ive spewed? how naked and vulnerable ive made myself? ive shown him all of me, but its like there is semi opaque glass between the true, raw me ive shown him, and him. it's like no matter how much i show, no matter how much he wants to understand, he just....can't.

I think the reason this bothers me and scares me is because I am always, always gentle. Its not really easy being gentle but it's not that difficult either. i love him more than anything and i always want to be kind and understanding. I never yell, i never use a harsh tone, ever. ever ever ever. i do little gestures in thought of him. sometimes, i think the reasons these things hurt, is because i know i would never do them. i know he is just a normal person from a normal family where using a slightly different tone doesn't mean anything besides fatigue, but even when im super tired and super hungry, i do not act rude. there are times he's just kind of ...not mean or rude in an aggressive sense, but in a much more subtle way cuz hes super gentle that scares me even more. i hate to type this here. i know if he saw this he'd be heartbroken that i have these thoughts. i just want to...i dont know. these small things have been hurting me less recently, but i feel like asking him to be constantly gentle isn't realistic for someone. that would involve him repressing his emotions, and i dont want him to have to do that. im his confidant, his best friend, his lover. i will see him through everything, and i understand the true reasons behind every harsh tone...i guess im wondering if this kind of thing will ever stop hurting. if ill ever stop being scared?

how do i make him understand? is there really anything to understand? have i just been oversensitive this whole time, the entire 19 years? what cant i remember? did i do all this damage to myself? did i create a false world inside my head that i let damage me? did i let all those people hurt me? what if what they did wasn't that bad, and i was just young so everything hurt more?

One thing that has been key in healing and really helped me was the realization that I am my own person.

Everyone is experiencing the world through their own perception. That includes you. For the majority of my life, I always felt like an afterthought for someone. I didn't have my own thoughts or feelings, wants, or desires... I was just at the whim of the scariest/strongest person in the room. But that changed when I realized I didn't have to engage with people in that way. I didn't have to categorize myself or think of myself as lower than these other folks. 

You can imagine it like a storybook. Everyone is the main character in their own story. That means you are, too. And when you have thoughts or feelings, you don't have to relinquish them to anyone. You can just have them. 

You don't have to acquiesce to someone else's opinion, ever. You dont have to find a consensus or agree. You dont have to think what everyone else in the group thinks. You can be an individual. 

You can nod in ""agreement"" while silently telling yourself your true feelings. Hold space for yourself. 

It doesn't matter if it's your mom/dad or your family or your partner, or whoever. They are not you. You are you. 

This is part of developing the self. Something many of us didn't get the chance to do. 

A lot of posts here are filled with frustration that you internally feel like you should be your own person but have been taught or threatened into always being enmeshed with others. I get it. I've been there. I lived most of my life there. But you don't have to stay there.  It's possible for things to get better. You're here, after all. If you didn't want to feel better, you wouldn't be here. Congratulate yourself for that. "

However what I really struggle with is just seeing people in real life and being so judgemental, so dismissive. Everything seems so fake and superficial. Everytime I find a person who I can maybe tolerate I always find it so easy to find some reason to break things off. Is this a destructive habit? Like I feel so cripplingly alone all the time but being around people doesn't help. The type of connection I crave just isn't there but am I just sabotaging myself but cutting everyone off, do I not give these things time to grow? But then can anything grow if I'm just miserable with these people all the time? And is it even then that's the problem when I'm the one who can't tolerate anything or anyone?"

I always knew growing up, deep down, that something happened to me. I used to play a game with myself and stare into space and pretend I wasn't in my own body. I pretended my soul was leaving my body and able to live someone else's life for a bit. I realized years later by talking with my therapist and reading these threads that we just innately have these coping mechanisms in us sometimes. I would lock my bathroom door and sit on the sink letting cold water run down my hands. I loved going into the closet because being alone and unseen felt safe.  The biggest thing I did was disassociate. I think everyone thought I was a bit dumb, including myself, but I think I just wanted to protect myself by not remembering anything. 

I don't really know what my purpose is in writing this out. I think I just want to share it with someone who isn't my therapist. I have a lot of friends, but only because one of my coping mechanisms is showing people what they want. They aren't very close to where I could call them for support. And the couple of friends that are supportive, I just don't want to break their hearts, ya know. I'd feel embarrassed telling them too. I can imagine them pitying me. Crying maybe and then I'd cry. And then they would always think about it when they looked at me. It would become part of my identity and I don't want this to be part of my wholeness to others. 

The flashbacks I have are me from three years old. It's really really challenging to not be able to confirm 100% what happened. It drives me crazy that I will never really know how they assaulted me. I remember bits and pieces. It's strong feelings. It's blurry things where I can't remember the exact details. Did it happen on the couch covered in plastic? Did it happen on the daybed with the red bed frame? 

One of the silver linings of finally remembering was being able to trace everything back. My severe reaction of almost fainting when the security guard pressed himself against my body to dance. The panic, the freezing. I also remembered these angels I made up in my childhood. They were two little cherubs on each of my shoulders. One was sassy and chaotic and the other was very straight-laced and sweet. They would always reassure me that they would take care of me. I was happy to be able to remember them again.

The 4 year anniversary of me having the flashbacks is coming up on February 22nd. I am going to do something nice for myself. Go to a museum, maybe a nice dinner. I'm crying as I write this. I'm a big crier. It's all heartbreaking, but then there's those little parts that peak through that are sweet. How you managed to hold your own hand through it. How you still found some rays of light in it all. 

Thank you for reading this. It means a lot to share with other people who get it. I am so sorry it happened to you, to us. We deserved so much better. "

It would be simply stating or asking a need or a want from family, or just telling people what I’m okay with or not. Or what I’m not comfortable with. Just basic boundary setting. But anytime I do I overthink if I’m abusive, narcissistic, a bad person, insert any beating myself up term and I *hate* myself for this.

Most of the times I don’t reach out or set proper boundaries and I see other people being able to set them without overthinking they’re a shitty person.

I feel like my brain and body are constantly in fight or flight mode the moment I have to do anything that involves me interacting other people.

I haven't been severely punished, ostracized, or mocked in years yet it's like my body is constantly anticipating these things. I have to make a call tomorrow and I've been shaking nauseous all day thinking about it.

It makes me feel pathetic. I'm 22, I'm an adult. I should be PASSED this by now. Yet I still feel like the confused 6-7 year old getting scolded, laughed, and excluded by everyone for every little or big mistake. I was never offered help, just ridicule. So now I feel great shame and fear of asking for help and making mistakes 

I know this sub isn't fond of the term victim mentality, and I wouldn't use this term to describe anyone else's mental state because idk what they've been through and how they handle life as a result. 

But for me, I feel like I do have a victim mentality right now. Sure I can blame my parents for this, but what can they do now? Only I can fix myself, only I can save myself. This fear and the anxiety is eating me alive. 

I sabotage all of my efforts of transitioning into adulthood because of this. I can't really vent to the people in my life because even though they care about me, I can kinda tell my bs irritates them  And why wouldn't it? Nobody wants to parent an adult. Even I'm getting sick of myself and my complaining 

I've been whining about the same issues for about 3 years now and made zero progress when I know I can do it. Is this common for people with c-ptsd? If you had learned helplessness, how long did it take you to finally come out of it? 

What pushed you to free yourself?"
CPTSD,My [33/F] friend [33/F] doesn't believe that I was abused by my father. What should I do?,1927bh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1927bh0/my_33f_friend_33f_doesnt_believe_that_i_was/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Key_Stage_3131,Key_Stage_3131,2024-01-09 05:39:07,My [33/F] friend [33/F] doesn't believe that I was abused by my father. What should I do?,"Hi all,  
As per my previous post, my \[33/F\] friend \[33/F\] of 29 years confronted me at dinner over the things her mother \[68/F\] had obviously been told by my father \[71/M\]. I was willing to open up about my trauma, but she wasn't interested in listening.  
The one I was most concerned about was that I had mental health issues related to the hormones I take to treat endometriosis. I do have mental health issues, but they are related to complex PTSD. I knew this narrative had come from my father because he tells everyone that I'm ""crazy from all the hormones"".  
Once you've read the messages, what would you recommend? What should I do?  
I wanted to work things out between us, so I sent this message:  
""Hey,

  
I wanted to get in touch because I have been feeling a bit unsettled after we had dinner. You made a lot of inferences about my mental health in relation to the hormonal treatment I’m receiving.

  
I really don’t know where you got these ideas from because I have never had mental health issues related to the hormones I take. Mental health issues are not a side effect of the medications I take.

  
I suspect that you are relaying information that has been passed from my dad to your mum. It’s difficult to explain without more context, but my dad has been known to embellish the truth to paint himself in a more favourable light. My mum has admitted to dad’s tendency to do this as well.  


I’m willing to talk to you further about the things that have gone on in my family, but I need you to be transparent and honest with me about what you have been told.  
xxxx""  
Her response baffled me. It was as follows:  
""I have been nothing but transparent and honest. For u to imply otherwise is grossly insulting. What do u mean by mental health issues when I never mentioned anything of the sort ? All I recall mentioning is the connection between medication and mood. This is the second time u have been extremely aggressive towards me. I took it the first time but have no intention of letting u get away with nonsense a second time. What your father says to anybody is not my concern. All I can say is that I have not been told anything that u claim your father told my Mum. I am not even sure if they have had any contact. Do not take out your personal issues on me. I remember sending u a SMS on 12 January last year saying u had my full support. I doubt if I will feel the same way again given your unjust, unfounded, rubbish allegations. U make me wonder if u do indeed have mental health issues. What an about face from your pleasant words when we parted that evening. I was even happy for u to come to my home on NYE. Whilst what has gone on in your family is not my concern, I am still happy to listen and support. Surprisingly it took u days to conjure up imaginative stories. Any specific conspiratorial reason behind wanting to communicate only on Facebook ? Marketing reasons don’t cut it.""  
I then replied:  
""Extremely aggressive? Reread the previous message. There is no aggression - I am simply trying to get to the bottom of this.  
I spoke to my mum about what you said, who spoke to my dad and confirmed that he spoke to your mum about a year ago. It was pretty clear from a few things you said that your mum had passed on things that my dad had told her, especially the comments about my parents' investments in the 90s.  
You also asked me if I thought I was pampered. I think I said yes, but in hindsight I have no idea why. I don't think I'm pampered at all. I have to ask my parents for money for my medical costs, and I'm fortunate to have that, but I'm hardly pampered. My mum agreed.  
I don't blame your mum, if that's what you're worried about. My dad has a long history of doing this and I can't think of a single person in my private life who hasn't been contacted by my dad in the past five years.  
Be careful not to make judgements of people before you know the full story re the mental health allegations. You really don't know what goes on behind closed doors.  
When I said goodbye to you after dinner, I wasn't being disingenuous. It took me a while to process what you had said and think about how I would respond. The things that have gone in my personal life are not easy to talk about, and I have to consider the effect that speaking about them will have on me.  
Communicating on Facebook isn't related to a conspiracy. I just receive a lot of text messages, from doctors, the post office, websites requiring security codes, etc - and when I receive texts that I need to respond to, I tend to forget to respond because they get lost in the list. On Facebook, I only communicate with people I know and your message doesn't drop too far down the list. I also have Facebook open while I'm working during the day, so I'm less likely to forget.""

He had anger issues and I'm still processing and recovering from the damage he inflicted.
I tried to end the relationship unsuccessfully until the final time, when he still tried to act like I was his gf and made unreasonable demands.  He finally moved back to his state and visits mine once or twice a year. He contacts me to meet up, and is so oblivious to the damage he caused me, emotionally and other. My sleep schedule is still messed up after two years from being in complete adrenal exhaustion from the stress.
I have tried to subtly turn him down. He just can't take a hint.  I don't want confrontation, I don't even feel ready to talk to him. He always gaslit and denied any accountability so I don't want to tell him the real reason and have him gaslight me again (or Maybe he is so delusional that he believes he is blameless).
What finally helped me feel validated was contacting his ex who also refuses to speak to him, and learn that she went through identical emotional abuse.
She said he's become much worse with me, and yet he would claim not to know why she wanted nothing to do with him.
He would always act clueless and confused if I tried to point out his behavior and it's consequences. From the other side, so many things became clear. I haven't been able to date since because I'm still unpacking so much shit I should have never tolerated.
He just messaged me that he's coming to town and wants to show up at my work. I really don't want to see him. But I don't want to explain why. He never was any good at reading the room. I avoided him last time with a lame excuse that I was sick. I am now stressing at even being reminded of him. I'm usually very pragmatic with objects, but for the first time ever, I had to purge all the stuff he gave me or left at my place."
CPTSD,Why does basic advice feel so condescending?,1926tnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1926tnl/why_does_basic_advice_feel_so_condescending/,https://www.reddit.com/user/jadeforest11,jadeforest11,2024-01-09 05:10:58,Why does basic advice feel so condescending?,"I know that most people have good or at least neutral intentions when they give me advice, but it seems like the only answers I get are extremely basic and underestimate my understanding of things. It makes me feel like people automatically assume I have no self awareness when they feed me a line like ""Things will not change without changing them"" or something along the lines of ""Did you know therapy exists?""

I don't know, I guess it just feels like something generic to say to anyone with a pulse. I don't expect for anyone who gives me advice to give me a massively profound insight that suddenly changes my whole life but it seems like there are never any new answers. Just the most easy things to regurgitate.

I've basically had to raise myself emotionally and have put my every thought under a microscope just to make sure I don't end up like the people in my life who hurt me: inconsiderate, absolutely no self awareness, and no will to improve as a person. I know I still have a lot to work through and I'm not perfect, but at the same time I don't think I'm so oblivious that I have no self discipline to change or just have a two dimensional understanding of the world. I do already use some of the things people advise me to do but it does not cure my chemical imbalances. It's just a band aid on a bigger wound. I'm waiting for my application to be processed for therapy but I'm not optimistic due to a past experience.

The thing I am most sensitive to being told as someone with bad social anxiety (to the point of being agoraphobic) is either being told to ""Just put yourself out there!"" or ""Just make friends online"" when neither of those things have improved my problems. I can't suddenly ""decide"" to be confident when any happiness or comfort I took in myself is/was constantly destroyed by the people around me, and people online don't see you as a real person when you are behind a screen most of the time. I spent my earliest teen years up until last year trying to make real connections that way and it doesn't work 95% of the time. I've only ever made two long term friends that I didn't feel judged by and one ended up being a p*do so I'm done with that shit. Anyone else was just an acquaintance that drifted away slowly until it didn't matter.

I guess I'm so used to being ignored at this point that I would rather just be ignored than feel the disappointment of someone giving me advice that feels like it's coming from a place of apathy or assumptions about my lack of ability to improve my life. I haven't actively sought advice in a long while to save myself the disappointment but people give it to me anyway so I feel it either way. It mostly just makes me want to shut myself off more. That part is probably a trauma response to feeling uncared for but it's hard to shut off when my faith in people is already shaky at best."

I am a child of anti-vax parents. I only got vaccines for 3-4 years before being stopped completely. 

  
I am 15. I get sick quite often. I have to stay home from school a lot because I am so exhausted that I feel I might die. I am also severely mentally ill. My lungs are not the best, neither is my heart, not my liver, not my kidneys, there is so much bullshit in my body I may be dead before 50. 

  
I also was never taken to the doctor unless it was an emergency (bones hurting, even then most of the time I would just get that $2 Walmart wrap sports bandage thing) and even one time my mom said that she wouldn't take me to the hospital even if I broke my bones. 

  
At my old school, full of parents just like her, a family all got chickenpox. I did not, because I'd been vaccinated for it very young. I do not thank ""god"" for it. I thank time, and my parents being immigrants and properly schooled before getting brainwashed to America's anti vax problem.

   
I have probably been told a million times that the ""cabal"" will come get me and take my adrenochrome through murdering me and using syringes to inject it out of my body. I have seen videos of chanting and sacrifices. I have known what shit took place on Twitter 2020, then Parler, then Telegram. 

  
I have been denied healthcare so long and the mental illness in my head combination makes me feel that I am so strong I can take anything, even suicide attempts and neglect. Logically I know that it isn't true, and it will all catch up to me one day (one time I got so sick for one week, I thought I was going to die in my sleep) but it is only my age that keeps me alive. 

  
And the thing is, I do not want to be alive. Living with parents like these has cost me so much. I just woke up from two nightmares about them. But at least, sometimes, it does not feel so bad, and I can forget these things. Which is the only reason I can keep on going. 

Does anyone have anything similar to this? The whole homeschooling (that ""school"" I was in was a homeschool co-op with 50 students grades 5-12 and all anti-vax fundie christian creationist parents) thing, the healthcare neglect thing, etcetera? Any details on how this can affect the brain? 

There is this significant chunk of my life about this that I have hidden. The pain of healthcare neglect. Knowing as a child something is wrong. Getting beaten for it. Being told it is just the internet, when it is clearly much more. Knowing WHAT to do about it. Not being able to do it because your parents would rather see you suffer in agony than take you to ""Big Pharma trying to sell you cancer-causing medications!""

He advises readers that the [most common clue](https://pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html#Flashback) is feeling ""small, helpless, hopeless and so ashamed that we are loath to go out or show our face anywhere."" 

I chronically struggle with identifying my own emotions. I can identify others' emotions but can't label my own. The best I can do is describe a feeling as ""bad"" or ""good"". This makes detecting an emotional flashback difficult.

However, I recently came across an infographic from a National Academy of Sciences journal article that shows body activation maps for both simple (fear, sadness, etc.) and complex emotions (anxiety, depression, shame, etc.). It shows where study participants felt increased ""activation"", i.e., sensations, in their bodies during an emotion, and where they felt less. Here's the link to the infographic in the article: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1321664111#fig02](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1321664111#fig02) 

I look back on this infographic frequently when I can't determine what I'm feeling. Emotional flashbacks can be disorienting when they're not tied to an easily discernible memory. Hopefully, this resource will be helpful to others."

IRT vs Neurofeedback vs EMDR vs Medication,"Hi everyone, 

&#x200B;

I've been dealing with PTSD (from a google search CPTSD describes me more, just haven't had a doc say that specifically) from about 2 decades worth of trauma. I have many symptoms, but my worst that most greatly impacts quality of life are my nightmares. I have so many every night. I never have neutral or good dreams. 

&#x200B;

They're as ""light"" as stressful, anxiety inducing situations (i.e. forgot I had an exam, back in high school, can't use my pencil) to horrific scenes like someone's trying to murder me. And the ultra specific, fighting with my mother who is the source of my CPTSD. Often, the nightmares occur in my childhood home even if she is not present, so that exam I forgot about is taking place in my house. 

&#x200B;

I tolerated these nightmares as much as possible for years and years, but the last 4 or so months they've really gone off the deep end. I feel awful. My sleep is so terrible. 

&#x200B;

In the past, I've tried EMDR, with no results. I just completed 6 ketamine therapy sessions and honestly feel only a 5% improvement in my overall mind, but no improvements in nightmares. I am mulling over whether to continue the ketamine, as the costs are $475 per treatment and I had hoped I'd see better results after 6 sessions. 

&#x200B;

I cannot take this anymore. I did a little image rehearsal therapy, but only wrote out the nightmares and gave them new endings. I didn't revisit the drawings and plan to do so this week. I also try the pre-sleep positivity reinforcement ""I'll only have good dreams..."" thing. No luck. 

&#x200B;

For those of you who suffered from nightmares and they're now so much better or totally gone, what worked? I will try anything. 

&#x200B;

I am open to meds, currently only on Gabapentin. I came off all my other meds as I am having moderate health issues this year and needed to make sure my meds weren't causing them. 

&#x200B;

I know there are the options of prazosin or clonidine. The only issue is my blood pressure is already on the low of normal (96/55, 108/65, 95/55 are the last 3 readings I took at home.) and standing up quickly (especially in yoga/orange theory), can make me dizzy. I've yet to have it actually be a problem. It's more a nuisance I am mindful of when exercising that involves bending over or standing up too fast. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I am really struggling and need some suggestions/success stories. I just quit my talk therapy a few weeks ago and want to find a new provider who specializes in nightmares. Thanks everyone. It's been a tough journey. "

As someone who has experienced SA in my childhood and as an adult, this is sending me into a spiral. I wanted to scream for help but I couldn’t make a sound. I walked out of there like a zombie, no feelings or emotions. 

Now I’m beating myself up for not pushing him off, not yelling or screaming. I’m so ashamed. I told my bf, and he’s being very supportive, but I don’t know what to do with all my feelings. I’m too afraid to report the man, because who will believe me? It’s his word against mine. 

I also can’t fathom how i experienced SA again after already been through it so many times. It makes me wonder what I’m doing to attract this? How can I be a victim so many times? Why should anyone believe me?"

Undiagnosed here, but a long time lurker in this sub-reddit. Ever since I first read about cPTSD, things just kind of clicked (what led me here actually). I've been struggling with this for a couple of years but I think I am finally ready to try for a possible diagnosis so I can better handle the accumulative symptoms, some that have surely grown over the years since their onset.

I've done therapy before but it wasn't all that effective in the long-term, it was more like a short-term band-aid, treating the symptoms on a week to week basis, not the wound itself (I tried psychoanalysis, wich is kind of iffy about giving diagnosis so I don't know).

I would like to know what types of therapy would be best for me to get a more objective analysis of my symptoms in relation to my childhood trauma and know what the heck is this that I'm feeling. I've considered CBT before, but never actually done it, because I though I was just anxious, but it was most likely a strong symptom of cPTSD. Is CBT still effective for cPTSD or should I try something more specific?

I wanna also thank this sub, reading all the posts and comments have surely help me validate my experience and get at least some pieces of the puzzle together, before trying to find the whole picture in actual therapy."

I’m the youngest one of the three and you have a an adult child at 34 with an adult who just manipulates and complains and threatening to leave or off herself because he’s not respecting her boundaries and her space. Jesus. Like communication exist.

Like I’m so tired, I’m tired of always being the glue of this damn family when no one wants to act like a damn adult and if I speak about it I get ridiculed despite trying to help the situation. She sent me 8 messages about the situation and I’m not responding. I’m finally trying to get better, trying to recover from my breakup which I hid my relationship for 8 months because I couldn’t stand the shame and pity that I would get by being told “you see this is why men aren’t the priority, you should know better” always treated like I’m the deer in the headlights. No wonder my emotions and triggers are triggered so easily, the fight or flight mode always present because I have nothing to cling on. Like it’s not my job to fucking parent you! You’re the parent, you’re  the mother! Learn how to communicate without the defensiveness, the hostility, the weak mentality of taking everything so damn personal! Like nothing he does is about you! But you rather make yourself the victim and enable his behaviors. Your tactics of fear and manipulation is what’s wrong with you! For once if you came from a loving, gentle place maybe he would fucking listen but all you see is punishment. You rejected him your life just because of his mistakes and not once did you treat him like a mother, you treated him like a dictator. How disgusting instead of repairing you would rather run away.

This family is fucking fucked up. What an embarrassment . No wonder I swallow and cave myself as a kid when these things happen. I’m pushing 30 and I can’t even live my own life without watching and feeling I have to be depended on when I feel like I have no one myself. So fucking toxic and I hate it."

I don't feel my deterioration or quality of life matters to anyone. As long as I don't cause any problems or draw attention to myself. 

I want a parent attachment so bad,  it feels so missing,  I feel wobbly... like I am standing on one leg and i didnt get given a second one,   like I'm half developed,  and the sad thing it is irreplaceable. I didn't get those needs and now I probably never will.

My job is difficult, I won’t deny that. However, there are many things I enjoy in my day to day interactions with customers, explaining the processes/next steps, in addition to setting expectations surrounding the scenarios they’re involved in, and complexities that could go awry, trust me that some of these conversations are not easy to have, and yet I remain compassionate & empathetic. 

Today, I was put on a “grow plan” Basically, I’ll be removed from new work being assigned to me until Friday night due to being behind. Be mindful that we just got off the holidays, most weeks between Thanksgiving we didn’t have a full 5 day week, like we would, plus I took some PTO to celebrate my birthday that is 5 days before Christmas. Did I also mention that during the holidays, there were so many other employees on PTO, that increased mine, my fellow co-workers assigned new & pending workload? 

My supervisor told me he can clearly see that I’m capable at my job during his case reviews, even with my being behind, he doesn’t get many escalations. During our brief meeting tonight, my direct inquiry was, “What is it that I’m inherently doing wrong?” He couldn’t come up with anything, just that this will be documented & I’ll have to meet with him 2’x a day for the next week to come up with a plan for the day, as well as meet with two people that are “successful” in their role. 

My point of view is this, now I have to use the first 5 day week we’ve had in an attempt to get caught up, all the while now my time is being taken away from me multiple times a day when I could be focusing on working rking files,  making calls, returning voicemails, emails & texts. Make it make sense, because the only thing I can come up with is metrics.

Did I mention that they laid off 11% of the company in September? 

The corporate world is not built for those that live with CPTSD, of course after the brief meeting, I had a panic attack, that led to many other physical symptoms, worst of all the brain cloudiness & numbness made it extra hard to complete the rest of my day. 😔"

My history includes neglect, parentification, and a lot of isolation both on social level and in the day to day I was left alone a lot as a child. I’ve had a lot of years of therapy and I recognize I’m a lot better I used to be. I’ve done a lot of healing, I still just feel perpetually alone.

 I think anyone who’s felt with an abusive childhood can understand the confusing dynamic of feeling like the people who are hurting you are also the only people you have. I don’t particularly feel close to anyone outside my family but I no longer feel close to any of them either. It’s like more I heal the less and less I can connect with even them and I end up weirdly feeling even more lonely even though I’m getting better. 

Feeling like I have no one has led me to focus too much on finding a romantic relationship in the past, to the point that I was willing to accept pretty much any kind of treatment so long as it meant I had someone. I’ve grown past that at this point which I know is progress but I just feel like I’m running out of chances to feel connected with people or like I’m seen and cared for. Can anyone tell me about how it got better for them? I’m trying really hard to believe there’s hope and that I’m still moving towards something better."

(chronic illness),"I have ME/CFS, which is an incurable chronic illness characterized by Post Exertional Malaise or PEM. In short, ANY sort of exertion (physical, mental, emotional) causes a backlash of flu like symptoms and can permanently lower your functional baseline. Doctors don't currently understand why it happens or how it works, but it seems to effect the mitochondria and energy production in the entire body.   


I have a decently bad case of ME/CFS, I cant work at all and I can barely leave my house. Even positive, non triggering socializing causes an upswing in symptoms for multiple days afterwards.   


And it just feels like my abusive mother has moved into my body. I feel like this illness acts exactly like her.   


It's so unpredictable, something that's ""ok"" one day suddenly wont be the next day or even hour. It punishes you severely for minor infractions, isolates you from your support network, and eats away what little self esteem you have. It takes all your independence and gives you learned helplessness because its an incurable medical illness. No amount of therapy or ""self care"" will make my mitochondria work again. Oh and lots of people and even doctors think ME/CFS is a ""fake illness"" and we're all ""lazy,  depressed, and hysterical"" or ""faking for attention"".

&#x200B;

Its extremely triggering, which of course makes me sicker because getting triggered is so emotionally draining. It just feels like I'm living in a hell especially designed just for me.

Two customers got angry & ""wanted to speak w the manager"" situation.  One called me swear words, the other threw a pen at me when I asked her to write her number down.

A handyman on site saw my distress and called a supervisor from a different store, same franchise.  We shared workers. 

That supervisor ""came in hot"",, yelling  and started accusing me of abandoning the store (I was standing right there- I guess that handy man made it sound like I'd left, I had not) then he said I was probably too old to deal w stress.  I told him he was probably not professional enough to be a supervisor.  

He ran and & slammed the exit so hard he nearly broke the door.  (I can barely open that heavy door- can't believe he slammed it)

I made a legit report to the company re that supervisor's behaviour.  Not ONE co-worker who came back said, ""I'm sorry that happened"".  They all said how much they like that supervisor- who treated me like dirt.

I want to quit but...I just want to prove I'm not too old to deal w stress.  Sounds so stupid now that I write it out...

Should I put in notice?  Is this a toxic place or do I have to ""stick it out to show them""?

Sometimes I can't tell if it's MY shyness or confusion....I do well at this job except when a customer wants a manager...I like my coworkers, but again, not ONE person has offered any condolence for the way the customers reacted or how that other supervisor scared me & put me down.

As a child I looked up to him and didn’t realize the trauma he was causing me but now I am very aware of who he really is.

My dad is in a relationship with my stepmom and he is absolutely horrible to her. The beginning of their relationship was full of love bombing and she is desperate to get that back. So desperate to the point she is putting the blame onto other people instead of him. Due to my dad’s abuse I have PTSD and his behavior as of lately has been really triggering it. It’s gotten to the point I will lash out in anger whenever he acts out and it’s honestly not pretty. We get into arguments very often and my stepmom always takes my dad’s side because “he’s struggling with his mental health.” 

Thats always his story. He’s always the victim and he’s always “struggling.” He has fed that woman so many stories and so many lies trying to paint himself as the victim. I honestly think she’s trying to save him, but she can never do it. I was in that position once too. I believed him until I didn’t. But because she’s trying to shelter him and save him she is painting me out to be the villain. She is acting like I am the one tearing our family apart. 

Luckily I am moving out this Saturday. I was already thinking of cutting contact with my dad but I think I might cut her off as well. I feel bad but she’s becoming insufferable and hurtful. Any advice?"

For a little background I grew up in a family with a lot of physical and emotional abuse as well as neglect. I’ve been in therapy for about two years now and my therapist has said that I have cPTSD. One thing that I’m still having trouble with is feeling sad.

I haven’t really talked about it much and Therapy because it’s just kind of making sense to me. But like for example I’m going through a break up right now after a very long term relationship. And I just opened a package that I forgot I had ordered for him. It was some thing that we had bonded over, and it meant a lot to both of us. I also found one of his favorite shirts that we would play “fight” over throughout the relationship because it was so comfy. 

Looking at those things, immediately thought to myself. “wow that makes me really sad“. But the thing is that I can’t feel the sadness. I can’t cry, and I don’t feel it in my body. But I know that it makes me sad. I’ve had similar experiences doing EMDR and just regular therapy. Where my therapist will ask me how I feel and I tell her what I’m thinking. And she asks me how I feel again not what I think and I just can’t feel anything. And I’ve also been told by her that I smile when talking about my trauma.  And this is not intentional. It’s like i know it is sad, but it just doesn’t feel like it’s happening to me. 

I was just kind of wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I am also on an antidepressant and I know that can sometimes know I’m emotions, but it seems like I can feel every emotion except for sadness. I feel anxiety, I feel anger, I feel stress, I just can’t feel sad."

something I've been thinking about a lot lately, is that I do want to change my life this year, move out, find new friends, a partner and do fun social things. 

But at the same time, i don't really like what is considered ""fun things"".

I want to start studying again this year and I am scared about not being able to find friends, because truly, i don't like big parties, heavy drinking and doing reckless, dumb things, just because
 
"" we're so young and crazy"".

Like, I deemed myself as crazy a long time ago and it's no fun. 

When I to clubbing i can mimmic having fun. Or just drink enough to numb the nothingness in me (or partially at least). 

Even now, when I'm trying to be mindful and aware and actually feel my emotions instead of dissociating constantly, i don't get the gist of drinking til you're blacking out and being sick the next day. 

I want to experience the ""real"" meaning behind having friends - hanging around together, drinking coffee at a cafe, supporting and helping each other when it's needed. I need a safe, peaceful period in my life, for once. 

But Im scared it means being lonely . 

Like, how on earth am I going to find friend if what really pleases me is drawing, reading and walking outside (and looking at the sunshine ☀️)?"

this is really hard for me as I know she will want to see me when im at uni but I don't want to see her, as I think we really don't get on and I become very anxious around her. im not sure what I can do about this either as I know if I talk to her about this, she may become distraught and super upset/ angry at me, and though this doesn't change the fact, I will be very uncomfortable in my decision I think.

CPTSD,"Awful at consistently eating and hydrating enough, is this common with CPTSD?",191ygow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191ygow/awful_at_consistently_eating_and_hydrating_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Particular-Gate3433,Particular-Gate3433,2024-01-08 22:43:37,"Awful at consistently eating and hydrating enough, is this common with CPTSD?","I have always been unable to maintain a consistent intake of food and water. When I wake up I am either uninterested in food or I feel compelled to begin going through my day the moment I am out of bed. Coffee is the only thing I will have every morning. It isn’t a conscious battle in which I’m telling myself to not eat or to ignore hunger, it just doesn’t seem to register with any urgency. Even if I DO feel a sensation of hunger, I end up glazing over it very quickly.

Up until maybe 4 years ago I was nauseated every morning, which made me quite anxious and created a negative feedback loop (feel like puking > scared of puking/puking at work or school > anxiety increases > nausea increases). 

During the week I will work until 2-3pm before seeking out food, sometimes going as late as 5pm before eating my first meal. Same for water. Although I’m always aiming to eat more and eat more consistently, the task of eating often feels like I am force feeding myself. 

What is this behavior! It certainly could be related to anxiety disorder, but I wondered if this is common for other CPTSD survivors as well."

### Delusions

	Work at it.
	Really work, work at it
	24/7
	If I work
	Really work
	I  can do it.
	Convince myself 
	I don't need love
	Or  affection.  
	Or others..
	Don’t need friends.
	Or companions.

	(Insert recording of Tina Turner, “What’s love got to do with it?”)

	“Take it or leave it.
	I don’t need them”
	So mostly I don’t.
	Don’t take.
	Just leave.

	You can learn to be satisfied with shallow relationships.
	Water Cooler buds.
	“How’s the weather?”
	“ How ‘bout them Oilers….”

	You can learn to live being only half alive.
	Live in your head and not your heart.

	(Insert Simon and Garfunkel’s “I Am a Rock!”)

	Now and then, 
	I forget this lesson.
	Now and then,
	I lose my heart.
	I find someone 
	Who makes me…
	…I dunno.
	More complete.
	More alive.
	The whole world seems brighter
	When they are near.

	It doesn’t happen often.  
	maybe 3-4 times
	In fifty years.  
	Lesser ones, 
	barely infatuation 
	maybe twice that.

	And  it never lasts long.
	A week.  A month?
	Never a year.
	Never long enough 
	To even touch.

	They come to their senses.
	I’m not their type.
	They have someone else.
	I’m not what they’re looking for.
	They want someone stable.
	Without so much baggage.
	Someone whole.

	Rejected.
	Abandoned
	Once again.

	This too is a lesson.
	This too, I’ve learned too well.
	It hurts less if you don’t get close.
	It hurts less if you push them away.
	It hurts less while you wait to die."

My parents have already placed me in a psychiatric facility in their country of origin and asked me to return my emergency housing and benefits and to live with them again. After I stayed in institutions through youth care. This made my condition even worse and I felt like a zombie from the amount of medication I was given. Afterwards they arranged guardianship for me based on my medical report from psychiatry in their country. Now they want me to go with them and that way I can get rid of my rule. If I refuse, they threaten me and call me names. They also took my brother there and he is now unhappy in a monastery. A counselor said that if I am that afraid of them, I should file a complaint. I did this but regret it because I love them. I wanted to withdraw the complaint, but this is no longer possible. I miss my brother. No one from my family wants to see me anymore. I feel guilty for all the problems in our family. I see no hope anymore and I don't want to live anymore."

I was just casually watching YouTube when all of a sudden i got a notification from Reddit about a troll replying to my posts that i ""faked my PTSD for clout"" and i was not being abused but mildly disciplined. That troll even went as far as to dox me and when replying to positive comments of my posts, he started claiming that he ""knows me irl and knows that i lie a lot."" 

This is just plain garbage. I am 100% honest and never lie about my PTSD. Second, this person is just a stranger i never met before even online and this guy just wanted to waste his time ruining my rep. He blocked me so i cannot reply to his comments of my posts. 

When i managed to contact the troll on Discord, he just roasted me for no reason and said that i am a pussy and blocked me there too. Then this ended.

I am still stressed about the troll. But i can hopefully report him to the sub's mods and get his comments removed.

CPTSD,Long-distance friend self-isolating...

Caring or overbearing?,"A long-distance friend/significant other that I recently visited totally deactivated and self-isolated after I left. Mutual friends haven't heard from him either. This is not the first time he's ""ghosted"" (and he's kinda known for it in the gaming-circle we belong to). I kinda felt it coming on, I think, and was... less than sensitive about his pulling away, in a bout of my own anxiety around abandonment.

I have apologized for this, but gotten no response. Based on what he's told me about his ""black moods"" (where he isolates from everything except work) and his childhood, and experience with other loved ones who suffer with CPTSD, I'm reasonably certain that this is CPTSD in action (though he's never labeled it as such). Hopefully this doesn't overstep the ""no diagnosing"" rule.

So here's the situation -- I have his address. I'm fairly sure he is not taking care of his physical needs (he forgets to eat even when he's not in a funk), and I'd like to send him some groceries or something. Low-effort snacks that I know he enjoys. No like.. response necessary, but just a ""hey I'm thinking of you"" kind of gesture. I don't want him to feel indebted or pressured to respond... just reassured that he didn't ""ruin"" things and that I care about his wellbeing and haven't abandoned him.

His previous gf used to trample his boundaries -- call him and text him obsessively, fuck with his family and his work, so I'm not sure how he might respond to this intrusion on my part. I also don't want him to feel unsafe. Do I take the no-response for a ""fuck off"" and just respect his desire for space until he tells me otherwise? Any insights? I realize nobody can read his mind, but your take is much appreciated <3 Sorry for the neurotic novel!

Turned out it was too good to be true and my boss was behaving inappropriately and creepily towards me.  Parents told me I could leave and everything would be fine.  Well a month into that and I regret quitting so fucking bad.  I know it isn't healthy but god damn at least my boss actually liked me.  Getting my parents to talk to me or even pay me any attention at all is like pulling teeth.  It makes me feel like a child to say I want attention but it's better than sitting in my room all day and going unnoticed.  


I hate feeling like this.  My boss was possessive and controlling but at least I could tell that he cared about me.  Even when he was mad at me he'd sprinkle in something to make me feel better so he could keep dragging me along.  Even negative attention was better than this.   I don't feel as stressed out as when I was working there but I'm so lonely it might as well not matter.  


It's gotten so bad that it's making me want to call my boss.  He wanted to keep in touch after I left and he kept calling my mom to get to me.  Called me a few days before Christmas on Christmas then texted me on New years.  It creeped me out and it still does but at least I was on someone's mind.  I just miss him so much.  Even when he was being a huge ass to me.  I feel like it's effecting me more than it should.  I only worked there like 7 or 8 months and it's turned me into a huge fucking mess.  


I don't know.  I just miss feeling like someone actually wanted me.  Even if it was a wrong kind of want.  Even when I could tell he was trying to manipulate me.  At least he cared enough to try."

I have so much trauma around being judged by people in positions of authority that I just lock up when it comes time to write them. The last 3 years weren’t as bad because even I knew that I had kicked a ton of ass and gone far above and beyond, so it was a lot easier to muster the self-esteem to write a good review. However, this year was tough. I wouldn’t say I did bad, but there are a few projects where I know I fell short, and that’s all I can think of. It sends me into a difficult shame spiral, and I can’t find the words to puff myself up because I don’t feel great about it. I know where I could have improved, but some of it was also dealing with another extremely toxic person that spent 3 months triggering me to the point that I had a massive panic attack  but you can’t talk about these things in a review. You have to make yourself sound amazing, and humble enough to admit your mistakes and how you’ll improve in the next year… and like, I’ve been working really hard on myself to learn how to not become triggered by toxic people, you still can’t say this…

So yeah, I guess I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this during their annual review, and if you have any tips or tricks for overcoming the shame/fear cycle."

I'd even go as far as to say that out of the 8 billion, I might be one of the tens who've experienced the life I've had so far. 




I'm just. So broken. I try to be a functional human being but I just....can't. I cannot. My brain is stuck in a survival state. I feel like I've reversed back to our ancestors, constantly checking out my surroundings for danger, dissecting people's characters to determine if they're genuine or if they've going to hurt me. Hypervigilance goes to an extreme level for me. 



I try to be happy but I can't. Almost all of the times I'm content with being alone, but every so often I just can't handle it. I feel a physical void, a hole, right where my heart is due to the isolation and the traumatic memories. 



I did not deserve to get given this life. I DID NOT FUCKING DESERVE IT. I just want to kill myself. Maybe get a pocket knife and go vertically. Or horizontally just to cause myself more agony. Get a strong rope and tie a quick knot, find somewhere stable to hang it from. Get drunk and throw myself off a place high enough. Or maybe even just drown myself, at least I live next to a huge river. I've even thought and actively wanted to slice my veins with my nails. I don't know anymore. I just want it to end. It's not a life I wanna live. It's broken. It's destroyed. Nothing can fix it. Trust me. Nothing can FUCKING fix it. I can get a glimpse of joy only when under the influence. I just want it to end. I'm not sure I care anymore about what happens to my soul when I die. Throw me in a conscious black void for eternity for all I care. 




It'd be an oasis compared to this. I just want to end it already so badly"
CPTSD,Realizing that I lived my whole life without a sense of safety,191uq6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191uq6f/realizing_that_i_lived_my_whole_life_without_a/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual-Key6222,Individual-Key6222,2024-01-08 20:14:04,Realizing that I lived my whole life without a sense of safety,"Slowly realizing that what I lack is a sense of safety. With this realization, it feels like lots of puzzle pieces of my internal chaos are being matched. 

It explains my bad startle reaction that I have had my whole life; when I am in public places like coffeshops, there is no way I can sit somewhere where someone would come from behind, I always make sure to have a wall behind me and have full vision of everyone. 

It explains why when in the slightest bits of where I have to assert myself, I get a scared look on my face. One example of this that comes to my mind was one time when I went inside of a cab with a friend and the driver misunderstood our destination and I had to correct him, my friend laughed and said: ""oh you were so scared!"" I asked what did she meant, and she told me that I had a scared look on my face. I could not understand what she meant because that was just my face, I was not aware of my scared face. 

I got this remark here and there throught my life and I could not understand it, because I would be having my normal face on and out of no where someone would snarkly make the remark that I look so scared. 

I did a presentation in school once and my classmate made a remark after, she said you looked weird there. I asked how, she said verbatim: ""You looked like a scared child"".

My sister told me that whenever we are outside and if someone stops me to ask me for directions or something, I get so startled and I get a scared face.

In the past, I felt intense shame when all those remarks were made to me and I tried my best to forget them. 

I have also always felt a difference between me and the calm serene people. I felt the difference, but because I was so high on cortisol, I could not comprehend that I was on survival mode and that I percieved the world as DANGER. 

Speaking of cortisol, I am 26 and I am losing my hair and 25% of it is already white hair. It saddens me. The phrase of "" the body keeps the score"" is hitting me right now. 

Ironically, I am scared now.  I am scared of not making it out of these patterns. I am scared of not being able to heal myself and go on and lead a normal life, I am so terrified.

But let me celebrate this epiphany! I found out that I lost my sense of safety in this world, and I do not feel ashamed of what that made me do in the past. All of this means that if I treat myself a certain way and if I do certain things daily, I can build a sense of safety. What would that be? I do not know yet, but I hope I can figure it out.

I realized, this girl calling me a homophobe, when I never uttered a direct remark to anyone, said I ""gaslit"" her, for saying I DIDNT do anything homophobic, essentially I said ""this is wierd, I'm unconfortable, I'm gonna look here"" apparently in conversation after she first came out to me and another friend... She is not my fucking friend, anymore now. Anyway, I remember how I was between her, and the other girl, saying ""I'm uncomfortable/feel wierd looking between you two, I'm gonna look in the middle/other there\[?\] "" (that's what I did in group convos in my young teen days). Now it fucking sucks, as I type this I see how she ""misinterpreted"" me. Well, this was when I was 13 right, from 13 untill now nearly 19 I've always been confused about her and doubted myself. Felt 'gaslit'.

Anyway in context though whatever I said I literally never meant to reject her, and never remember it, and dont remember feeling it, and don't remember her being rude back, however, she was randomly rude, as the start of her random hostile attitude, but at the end of the meet, saying I should cope with her woman fashion shopping.

Also, I was literally just inbetween them, not part of the convo really maybe a bit, but she must've chose if she genuinely believed it to hear me muttering (not directly to anyone) after her coming out revelationing chat or during that I said ""this is wierd I'm gonna look over here"". She has like anger issues I'd think, but everyone see's her as a 'passionate' nice person. But didn't want to say much to me, was more interested in her friend who is a girl, probably reassuring her that she isn't interested in fucking, and also other way that being gay is cool I accept you dear friend, when I was really silent and not adding anything just being the male of the group.. well I wasn't interested in 'making a big deal/ not sure how to say it honestly enough../praising her for the existence of her gayness? I only said anything I can remember tbf about it with these people when it was just me and the non-lesbo, I said if she was a masculine woman- as being gay, in a non judgy way.

So maybe I'm missing pieces and stuff...

Well, whatever you take from that, I'll add vague details that can't accurately describe the whole situation back then...

She ran away from me first day of school, bit less than 3 months from her pride month where she came out. She actually ran, at school. I never got her to explain it, I brought it up twice tho I believe not like a fucking bitch like her would be honest and pretend nothing even happened? Oh fuck well atleast this is definitely gasliting. She did say multiple times that she never ran, the two times I asked, \*first day of school\*... Nope never did nothing 🤣 suck ur suicidal thoughts that we used to talk on x 👍 that's actually her, she kept having to use that emoji in our last convo cause she couldn't back herself up..

Context police: in June of 2018 she came out as gay, in September she ran from me \*%)\* ha look at that emoji lol he look like me after her shit... In 2019 I stood up before the last school term (oh June almost aswell lol) and had an angry chat with her, never had done, ever.. I was making her cry via text 🤣 sorry but if u call me a homophobe and cry cause I expose u and ask if u even have time to talk .. she made a point it was a Sunday evening lol but I said if she could talk... If I came up on the street, harrassed her that wouldn't be great.. but I said I'd like to talk if she had the time... On text... That's so fucking respectful even though I have a lot I need to address and am NOT happy. Her friend is also anal and didn't tell her apparently that I didn't mind her gayness, I actually think I remember specifically saying I was fine with her gayness... On that first day, to the non-lesbo. Also texted her saying ""we need to break the ice"" and talked about the incident in the halls on Year 9 day 1, denied it, Christmas December time I texted 2018.

I told her I liked her in February 2018.

More deets (I'll cut this off now vigilant unnecessarily-long-post traverser) : I had feelings too before we stopped talking properly, it was like we could still be friends? I was just so happy to talk to her, but suddenly things between us were dead or something? Before she came out in early 2018. She probably was uncomfortable with me, and maybe thought of me as wierd, and this is what I don't like, she seemed to distance herself along with everyone else essentially, not as a group idk I haven't slept sorry. I tried fixing things by messaging her, she said stop messaging me I have Anxiety (gad). She I think said ""oh no things are fine I'm happy to talk to you"" but Idk maybe I just didn't talk enough irl but, she didn't help at all cause I said I had issues and, specifically, S.A.D so I wasn't talking as much but I didn't have classes with her so I met her at lunch but that was it, I swear I did make an effort to talk, I remember again mid post writing I was hanging out with her a bit and other friends, being,.. her friend? But , despite meeting a few times in summer with people in September she sprinted and fucked my confidence as a whole in half and now I'm jittery everywhere and I don't even know what should make me jittery, a bad, general opinion doesn't deserve my body's fucking jitters fucking mind.

Anyways. Enough of all this. I need to get the whole kicker here 🤠 ! I made myself a homophobe for saying the word wierd at bad timing, but, I texted a few hours later to say I was cool with her being gay as I knew she wanted reassurance, and guess what? YOURE MAKING A BIG DEAL OF IT (reference first part of post) so... Yeah.. I'm a homophobe, though I texted you saying how good it is pretty much forcibly and after cycling up just to hear really that you like women, I can't make a thing of this thing you are definetly making a thing of I think (sorry- boredom😆)so I can't make it an important matter, it's patronising and evil and exaggerating how much it matters in general and to her is the general idea of what she said in response ""big deal of it"" is included somewhere if I have misinterpreted her but she did like genuinely put me down, like I felt like bad just to be friendly on her gayness? And like, I don't know if my attitude was like that 'too friendly pretending she cares more than actual about a subject matter' like someone trying to have power when u don't care. But rant/story/ fucked up historys over.

I'm insecure about the gaslit thing. We are BOTH gasliting each other (but she is the liar lmao) cause I say ""you ran, and I never said being GAY is wierd at all not even to you or to non-lesbo"" she says ""I never ran. You said you were uncomfortable and it was wierd as soon as I came out, and you're an evil person, and, uh, homophobe hehe xd ruin your school reputation whilst u have social anxiety?""

Hey yeah I don't talk now to him cause ""*Matthew pushed me away- when I came out as a lesbian*""... Definetly more, but atleast I can quote it actually 95% accurate lol tho someone else told me this...not even fucking bitch ass... You never fucking texted, I texted 1 week before school finally in ages since I can't text or it's harrassing your anxiety issues, we have a nice convo. Well uh not at school 1 week later when you run from me in the language halls you... :( why? Sorry I have badly needed to make a post, just a long good post about this 2 year period I knew this girl. From 2017-2019 in total.

Shit if she is on this subreddit leave you can talk to me about this elsewhere please and I have no clue what I think of you now, the past wasn't great, at all fucking piece of shit running my life making me wanna die \*leave now lol I don't care talking like this\* ....

Anyways. So, I could keep ranting but I'm tired. I just need to say one last knowledge bomb piece.. *closes opens eyes* I thought this girl was fit. As fuck.. I looked at her quite a lot, but I always looked at girls, but now there was an obsession with her body. Which replaced my obsession with a good, emotionally open friend in my life for once. So I looked at her. But if she said stop I would stop(didn't happen)... Idk I mean I admit I went out of my way to look at girls pervily in my younger-mid teen years and I was DOWN BAD for just like, a girls lower half in tight clothing.. and I looked up skirts a shit ton. I didn't have any relationship when I was 11-12.5 with my father, I see that as a reason I was such a creep... And bullying cause I couldn't talk with girls cause they all picked on me/ felt too wierd to talk to a girl as a person I think. I started puberty like half a year ish before I couldn't talk to my pa. (Legally no contact allowed.. not a criminal, Fuck ss). This has deleted a few empathetic, warm to the heart, comments... I mean the girl was annoyed with me one or two occasions, it seemed, seemed she was tryna hide her body from me ect but never said anything, and so she now probably uses this to further her claim people should treat me bad cause I swear I did nothing wrong from 2019-2023 but people from my school know me as not quiet finally... But don't like me. But some think I'm cool. But don't even wanna be friends.. cause I was a creep I mean, I had respect I think? Hard to be when ur a two faced fucking ----- I looked alot yeah but I tried to be discreet, I mean it was only if she was there available to look, also sorry if I sound creepy, I would perv if told not, but if you got a hot steaming roll of a bod, someone will look if nature intended that body to advertise your life goal of continuing the generation... That was her basically... Sorry.. if she was reading this again don't wanna be a creep I'm just horny lmao.

Dont say her rudeness was cause I liked her ass. Please don't pick that out of everything...

But yeah it's funny we are both apparently gasliting each other omg couple goals right 😂 (I laved her)but I miss her. Now is the better bit for her, so to be fair on her .. We met cause she was doing a summer camp activity week that I did, we were close as soon as we met pretty much, she was beautiful, I didn't look at her at all now, cause I thought this sexualization was wrong.. I saw her jeaned behind and thought how wierd and uninterested I am at looking at my friends area in jeans... Only once we weren't really friends did I look. She was like a female version of me, someone else said we were a good match, she was smart and funny and like real? Like, I became introverted because I loved her looking like that ? Introversion=real somehow lol but when she left one the last day.. I missed her 🥲 couldn't say bye. I talked with her about how ""I don't know if I can keep going"" well ok that I think was the most immediate suicidal statement, but I think I must've talked about suicide alot, atleast alot of mental health we talked about like every day and I hadn't had a good friend before like this... I got supported by her though, so much it felt like, we did homework at a cafe and didn't meet again sadly just us two but it was mainly really just text convos are friendship was and seeing each other at school but I was less talkative then, I got more talkative in the summer when I wasn't talking to her, I sorta said ah fuck it's summer I'll forget the situation.

Anyway I need to sleep this post took 30+ mins I need to eat before it's too late and let myself starve again... Appreciate all response. As long as it's not ""she was creeped by your pervieness"" otherwise... I'm sensitive about this, don't be arrogant or I might sound 'hostile' I sound like that people say on reddit I don't death threat so I don't see where ""hostile"" comes in? Anyways. Cheers.

\*TLDR;\* my ex closest friend was gasliting me, and saying I gaslit her, but I think else too so we basically are gasliting each other now by just confidently thinking we are the right one here 😂 she is the wrong one. 🤣 I never said she gaslit me, I just told her what she did to me. She said I gaslit her. She told me what I don't remember doing at the apparent juncture (gay reveal) so she's gasliting me to think I did this. How could she possibly believe (and is it possibly accidental/purposefully sloppily accident gasliting on her end somehow?) that I genuinely didn't accept her being gay and didn't like her as she was gay? I actually said I accepted her on text, so re readable and she called me homophobe.

Also I did look at her but she had nice outfits I wasn't wanting to be rudely hetro to her but then I didn't feel motivated if it meant anything to respect her after her random abandonment trauma she gave me in the hallways in 2018? No imma perv yeah but I mean I just liked how she looked it wasn't malicious it wouldn't benefit me to maliciously perv someone cause I'm mad at em... It was fucked. But you could easily say I'm a bit fucked to perv on a lesbian for a school year... So I might not have the high ground 😬 but I am sure I'm the victim, not just the one who did fucked things/complicated things she did that a ton more..

Robert Oppenheimer. He created the first atomic bomb, and he had a lot of personal struggles.

In one scene, he comes home to find that his newborn baby is crying and his wife is just sitting in another room, clearly doing nothing about it. He says ""Shouldn't you go to him?"" and she says ""I've been going to him all day!"" and drinks some alcohol.

So Oppenheimer *takes his baby to his friend's house* and asks *his friend and his friend's wife* to take care of the baby. Oppenheimer explains that he and his wife are shit parents and their son deserves better than this.

WOW.

Just imagine if bad parents were self-aware like this. Imagine if they reached out to healthy friends like this. Imagine if it was more normalized to take in someone else's child as your own. Even if it's just a temporary thing, a once-in-awhile thing, it could potentially have hugely positive impacts.

Note that Oppenheimer *never* blames the kid in any way. He doesn't treat his son as an annoyance to be gotten rid of. He treats his son as a human being who needs love and support and he recognizes his own (and his wife's) inability to provide that love and support, so he set things up so the kid will *get the love and support he needs*.

What a concept!

I loved studying psychology and even if I did struggle mentally in my early 20 (who doesn’t?) I was really happy the last years with my studies, my hobbies and my health relationship. But like 6 months ago I kinda fell into a depressive hole. It started with a visit a my parents house where I found my self unable to speek anymore and endet with a vacation with my family and suicidal thoughts. 
I turned to my parents for help but they didn’t wanted me to seek help and kinda just get myself together. 
I did seek help and found out threw therapy that the bullying and physical abuse from my brother wasn’t normal like my mom always said. I was always framed as being overdramatic. Also I don’t really remember most of my childhood, only bits or more how I felt but not why). Now I still go to therapy and struggle between feeling like an attentionseeking Dramaqueen or an actual victim of abuse and neglect by my parents. It’s so hart to really validate that I was abused. Something in me always things Nahh your parents tried your best and they said it was nothing crazy and even if your brother is still awful now (he’s 26 now and my bf for example even calld him a narcissist bevor I even starrt therapy) he just wants the best for you, but can’t act like it.

Before long I went from feeling sorry for myself to identifying as a victim within my own narrative plot. 

I have become intoxicated with ‘how people have crossed me’ and a desire for vengeance. 

It’s easy to come up with injustices… ‘oh the government!’ ‘oh my landlord!’, ‘if only them over there!’, ‘had I never wasted my time on that ex!’… The list can go on and on but it does nothing. 

If I could give my advice it would be to spot signs that you are mentally meandering down this path and instantly snap out of it and do something to make the lives of you and those around you somewhat better. You may not like your life (there’s a high chance you don’t if you’re experiencing constant pain) however own and accept responsibility for you. 

Visioning yourself as ‘a victim’ or ‘the victim’ is probably the most destructive psychological deceit that can be engaged in and only leads to more misery. Pain has a way of breaking down the boundaries of joy and stuffing you full of misery, I would say don’t let it. Despite the pain do something beyond it which puts you back in control. 

Also rigorously protect your boundaries. You can’t afford to have negative energy around you when you’re in recovery or to be putting  negative out there… You need to preserve your strength or you’ll be in the same place and worse 5 years from now.

Hope this posts helps someone and saves them some time on their recovery :)

It’s easy to slip into this frame of mind when you’ve had one bad experiences after another or your focus has shifted to only recognise the negative. It creeps up on you casually and gradually infects the mind. You have my compassion if you too are struggling. 

Anyway thought I’d share, maybe it may help someone, certainly helps me in recognising it in myself and catching it. "
CPTSD,Am I wrong for being irritatated? This feels like a small trigger yet it bothers me so much,191rl7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191rl7y/am_i_wrong_for_being_irritatated_this_feels_like/,https://www.reddit.com/user/BlissfulBlueBell,BlissfulBlueBell,2024-01-08 18:08:46,Am I wrong for being irritatated? This feels like a small trigger yet it bothers me so much,"I can't tell if I'm overreacting but I loathe being told how I feel by someone else. Can you all here tell me if I'm wrong?

TL:DR Mom tells me I'm tired because I ""don't want to clean"". It put me in a bad mood because that's not true, im genuinely tired due insomnia that she has literally commented on just yesterday. On top of that, she complimented me last week for keeping the house clean and washing the dishes multiple times a day. So why would I suddenly be tired because of dishes this week? 

For context, my bro cooked some food and I said I would wash the dishes after. But, ive been dealing with really bad insomnia so I wake up late or I stay up all day then become tired too early. Today was the latter.

I couldn't even finish my food, I fell asleep with it next to me. My mom accidentally woke me up, which was okay because I was facing a wall and she didn't know I was sleep (I was eating on my bed, bad habit I know haha). She said what she needed to say and walked off. 

She came back and asked me if I was still going to wash the dishes. I said yes and I just wanted to take a nap first. She told me to wrap up my food and make sure I eat. Fair enough. I did that and while I was at it I began bringing dishes from my room and around the house to the kitchen so everything is in place when I wake up. 

While I'm doing this my mom offers me caffeine pills (which is also annoying because she scolds me for drinking coffee saying I don't need caffeine but then she offers me it??) . I said no thanks. Then she tells me she thinks I'm tired because I don't want to wash the dishes. And this just put me in a bad mood because all last week I continuosly washed EVERYONE'S dishes everyday multiple times because I didn't want them to stack up. 

My nephews came over for the weekend and I ended up not washing them because I got overwhelmed by the kids (not just that but my brother said he would wash them and didn't wash the last batch before he left). So they stacked up again. 

So not only am I irritated that I have to clean the dishes I was told would be washed, I don't like being told how I feel and why. Especially when I was constantly told I'm lazy as a child when it turned out to be undiagnosed adhd. 

Lately I've been trying my best to stay on top of all of the chores because I feel like I'm the only one who gets called out for not cleaning despite basically being the ONLY one who cleans in my house (which is whatever because I don't work right now but this has been happening since I was a minor). 

I don't want to be the jerk that uses adhd as an excuse. My mom even applauded me last week for keeping everything clean. I told her I'm not tired because of the dishes and I'm not trying to use it as an excuse or anything I'm just tired from poor sleep. 

She back tracked and said she's ""just joking"". Well it didn't feel like a joke. I don't understand what was funny. I'm already tired and cranky because of it, she keeps talking when I just want to sleep, and then that remark has me really frustrated. 

Am I wrong here for being annoyed?"

I've recently discovered that I've emotionally numbed myself as a defensive response to neglect and for the longest time I felt like I was a spectator in my life rather than a participant in it. So I keep asking myself, how does emotional release feel like, especially for someone that pent up their emotions for the longest time. I genuinely want to release my emotions to be a full on person again but I'm also terrified of how that would feel.

She was deeply depressed that she dying and many of her friends stopped contacting her. I can’t stop thinking about that pain.

I cannot help but feel depressed about that she couldn’t be there, but I am especially upset that I understand why now.

I feel my deep sadness is something that I wear on my face. People have taken advantage of me for the fact that I try so hard to make them happy like I did for my mother.

Some days, (like today) I can't do anything but break down and cry. In that moment, years of repressed anguish and fear come flooding back. Just like back then, I feel powerless and out of control, and ive got nobody to seek comfort in.
It seems like everyone else can move on so easily, my parents think im just chosing to live in the past. Almost as if they expect me to be fine after a couple walks and other random, pointless distractions. As if im not mentlly ill AT ALL. As if they weren't the ones putting pressure on me to get over everything quickly, or else ill be just like my fucked up cousin that also chooses to live in the past.

I can't do that. Its not that easy. I feel haunted, tired. Most of my energy goes into maintaining my mask and holding on for dear life to what's left of my sanity. 
Every. Single. Day. Is spent trying to silence my mind. Trying to purge those images and thoughts. Trying not to lash out and control my emotions (dont want to be like my parents). Trying to ground myself in reality. Convincing myself that I'm truly safe. Every. single. Day. 
I notice that my jaw is sore from clenching so much. Every day I feel the tension throughout my entire body. I get stomach cramps, and headaches, and sometimes it feels as if I can't breathe. I'm always switched on, always on edge, always managing some thing or another.
I've tried going for walks, and I've tried distractions. I've tried just being happy and not being negative - changing my mindset. I still try all of that, but nobody around me seems to get that it's deeper than that. I'm genuinely mentally fucked up and I don't choose to be this way. No matter how much I repress, or confront, or manage I'm still left feeling broken. At the end of it all im still left with these fucked head images and this insane emotional rollercoasters.

I'm still waiting on therapy to no avail. I called a helpline, just for them to advise that I numb myself to get through the day. I can't turn to family because they've caused this shit in the first place, and my friends and bf aren't going to want to hear about how fucked up in the head I am 24/7.

I've been suicidal for years, and today is the first time that I've truly acknowledged it. The reasonable side of me says to take things day by day, and that this pain won't last....

But fuck me, sometimes I want to sleep forever! This shit is exhausting. Atleast then I wouldn't have to feel shit for god knows how long.

I'm just so tired of it all. I don't want to feel like this forever. I don't really want to die, but I'm so tired. I really want to make better memories to make up for my shitty past. Ending it all now ends the possibility of that becoming a reality 

I just feel so trapped in my own head and I doesn't feel like there's a way out."

Penetration is difficult for me even when I crave it and my body is physically ready, it's as if my body collapsed and didn't allow it to happen. It hurts a lot, and even playing with my fingers feels uncomfortable. I have vaginismus.

It seems I've been sexually abused by my father in different ways and had a tough time in romantic relationships, mainly because I always ended up with unavailable people and relationships that contradicted what I believed to be my values, leaving me feeling hopeless and like a lost cause as I can't trust myself to be the adult of my life nor other people to give me the love and respect I give them.

The last relationship, while barely sexual, was romantic and I felt soul raped. I think that's the term that best describes it, even though I took an active role in it and hence have a lot of work to do.

All CPTSD-like symptoms are completely out of proportion in me and as a result I live in a state of hyperarousal with constant tachycardia, headaches and rejection to other people's company. I also struggle with suicidal thoughts and I truly hope I die young.

I've reached a point where being surrounded by masculine energy feels both uninteresting and dangerous - as I find women more attractive, mature and spiritual. I am bisexual. I just can't help but be aware that there is a high sexual component to it and many men have this in mind while interacting with women, it seems to be an override.

If I continue to feel like this, paralysed in bed and avoidant outside of it, I will lose out on some of the most beautiful things life has to offer.

I like to focus on my intellectual, professional and sport lives, as our minds, bodies and money is all we have to make it through life - people come and go; but I know what I'm doing.

I just expect people to hurt me and so I would rather be alone, which saves you the headache but also brings other problems.

I'd like to know if someone here experienced this and was able to make it through. If you haven't, maybe it's best to keep away from commenting as I wouldn't like this post to become a place where we incur in self-pity.

Thank you."

It's also odd you wanted me to chat on Thanksgiving with your molester ex step dad. I will not forgive and forget the abuse, neglect, humiliation, and bullying I endured as a result of your choices. You are not welcome in my life. My sobriety and health are more important to me than seeking whatever salvation you think I need. You created the Pit. 🔥 

For context, I stopped speaking to her for about 3 years 2018-2022 because she was in a mutually abusive marriage and wouldn’t stop venting to me about it while I’m in college in another state alone with my own problems including CPTSD from childhood abuse (from the man she told everyone was my dad and his extremely abusing wife, and from the neglect and abandonment by my mom).

When I reached back out to her, I was going through a time of wanting to make peace and forgive and exercise unconditional love. I knew she was who she was because she experienced abuse growing up. The molester ex step dad molested her at 5 years old and tried again when she was a teenager. I genuinely feel compassion for what she has been through. She responded with sending me Joyce Meyers videos about “getting out of the pit of unforgiveness, self-pity, etc” and said I needed to thaw my cold heart. I played into this and invited her to visit me twice and invited her to my upcoming wedding. 

I’ve recently fallen back into experiencing severe CPTSD symptoms and pushing everyone in my life away aggressively due to paranoia and general poor mental health and lack of using coping skills. I’m tired of fighting my inner demons. 

Yes, I’m blaming her, yes I’m an asshole, yes, I am stuck in a cycle of abuse. A snake eating its own tail. I am the combination of her crazy ass and the man she had me with who won’t acknowledge my existence.

I've recently decided to stop with all forms of therapy. I felt like the therapists don't actually listen. I felt like they were always just waiting for me to say some keywords that they've read about before so they could throw some standard exercises at me and ignored everything else I talked about. I don't think they have ever truly listened, only pretended to as to not break trust until they could change the subject.

No matter what specific flavour of fluff they wrap around it, I've found that every form of therapy essentially boils down to ""you have to accept your emotions unconditionally and give the validation you need to yourself"". 

Ok fine, we live in an unloving society created by an unloving species and therefore I should never expect anything from someone else. I should never hope for or demand understanding from the people who've hurt me so deeply (my parents), I should just find the solution in myself somehow. I'm ultimately responsible for myself and my feelings are my own fault. It's my personal failure that I can't figure out a way to tolerate constant pain. It's my personal failure that I can't figure out how to have a relationship with my parents that doesn't destroy me on the inside. It's my own personal failure that I can't live with them denying and deflecting everything I've talked about with them. Fine.

All throughout therapy they've also told me that I'm too closed off and I have to ""reach out"" and ""ask for help"" though. What help? What is the person I'm reaching out to going to do? It's an internal problem after all.

I have tried to follow the advice many times, but I don't experience any value in reaching out. I don't understand what I'm supposed to be getting out of it, especially given The Lesson from therapy. In the end I have to do all of it alone, internally, anyway. Other people only add stress and risk.

Sometimes I share online like this because it's the most low stress form of reaching out for me. I think I'm done with *people* though. This is probably my last post. 

Thank you all who've ever tried to help me though, I do appreciate the time and effort. I'm sorry that I don't know what to do with it.

EDIT: I'm not going to hurt myself btw, sorry I just realized that that's what the last paragraph might sound like. I have a dog and a partner I'm staying alive for. If I ever lose both I'll end it but for now I'm fine."

I had a rough childhood, both my parents are extremely narcistic as well as my two older siblings and I generally would say my childhood due to emotional manipulaton from my whole family was not too great. I can remember many individual instances from my childhood including being ignored by my whole family for days on end, or having to share a bedroom with my alcoholic father for multiple years.

After I moved out with my boyfriend at 19, things got way better.  But have always lingered in the back of my mind. 

I still have contact with my family, and have healthy boundaries and distance with them, but here the problem I am facing:

I seem to have blacked some things from my childhood out, to protect myself. I am fine with this, but random things in my life can trigger the trauma to mess with me. It can be as obvious as getting a text from one of my family members, but sometimes can be so weird things that have nothing to do with my family or childhood. It just pops up randomly..

It makes my life hell however. It causes me to becoming depressive and aggressive towards my partner for days on end.. I can sleep for 12 hours a night in these times and still be so tired the next day, it causes me stomach issues, skin issues and many more  


Do I need to figure out what individual things are bothering me or should I have a specific attitude towards this trauma? Please help!  


TLDR: Have some childhood trauma that although I am in general accepting of my childhood, randomly triggering and making my life hell!"

Im female, turning 32 soon. Ive been in relationships since I was 18. Some have been better than others, some have been outright traumatizing. Before I met my partner now I had come far in my healing journey. When I read my old writings I dont recognize that person, who was so optimistic, soft, empathatic and emotionel matured. 
I met my now partner who had loads of unhealed trauma and severe depression, and I made it my mission to rescue him like I did myself. 4 years later and I can say, I think in someways I did rescue him. I got him out of his addiction, he got on medication and therapy and got back to school, and are now doing very well and loving it. He doesnt want to die anymore and sees a future. 

I on the other hand didnt survive it. The last 4 years has also been filled with emotional, physical and verbal abuse and I can pin it back to a year and a half ago where I died inside. That is when he was finally better, and then abandoned me. He didnt breakup, but instead stonewalled me for almost a year. For me it was a year of nervous breakdowns, confusing, feeling used, unloved and invisible. We are still together but I am still deeply depressed, now more than ever. All those old selfnarratives I had worked so hard to overcome is back. I hate myself. Im not taking care of myself anylonger and I have no hope for the future. 

I used to have a feelings of warmth in my belly. I could imagine it as this orange ray. I knew I lost it in childhood but I found it again. Now its gone, and I fear its gone forever.

Besides the trauma from the relationship, old trauma has ressurfaced. Many things in the way he is reminds me of my father. It has ressurfaced flashbacks from being a child in an abusive home. My nervous system is constantly fight/flight/fawn and my body is very inflammed. I know, I just know, I cant get pregnant anymore because my body has been through too much constant stress. I feel to old to leave and start over. My love for him is still endless, and it would be too hard. I miss him all the time when Im with him, but knowing I would miss him forever is too much. I find I cant let it go until he fully chooses me and sees me. Maybe not for who I am now but for who I was. And that he will love me. I dont think you can call what we have now a relationship. I find myself non-existing most of the time. "

I keep forgetting everything. Tried my best to show up in time. Ended up being in front of the exam room 5 minutes late. 

And once there, I couldn't bring myself to open the door. I was only 5 minutes late and yet I was scared of the look other student and the teacher may have give me once I enter the room. So I went to the bathroom and locked myself there to cry. I couldn't (probably because I would be hit by my parents when I cried back when I was a child). 

After that, I went home, and now I am typing this while the other student are still in the exam room. I feel like shit.

It's not the first time something like this happened. Back in October I missed three school days in a row because I feared being 10 minutes late.

tbh I don't know where to post this but I just need to vent. Maybe in r/AvPD or r/socialanxiety or even in r/ADHD. I am just tired of being me and having all these mental health issues. I just wish I had a  normal childhood and that I could take my responsibilities and not run away every times.

&#x200B;

I don't even like the studies I am doing. I am currently studying to become an engineer and to be frank, I am mostly doing it because my parents want me to get a job that makes a lot of money and/or has a good reputation. I was the gifted mature silent kid who could ace everything without putting much effort. Now that my talent won't take me anywhere, I have to work, but I don't know how to. As a result, I am the last of my class. I hate school now and my friends are more acquaintances than actual friends. I feel so lonely too.

I hate seeing people getting disappointed by me. I am such disappointment. I want to die."

I've been battling with myself for years over this, asking myself to give one more person a chance, to not shut the world out, to acknowledge my symptoms for what they are and not let them rule my life.

But time and time again every time i let my guard down slightly, force myself to open up a tad, it happens again.  I get hurt all the damn time.

Sometimes my shit social skills ruin a relationship.  Other times i just.  Don't even know.  I attract people who only use me when they need something?  I'm a fucking magnet for opportunistic emotional vampires?

Whatever it is, after my last moment of vulnerability, i give up.  I've been saying this for years but i always come down from it in time.  I think i'm serious now.  I think i genuinely cannot handle one more betrayal.  

I've tried.  I've tried so fucking hard for years.  I've tried to heal, to be understanding, to realize my symptoms, to be objective, to be as healthy as i can personally and socially.  I've tried to understand that not ever person out there is my parents, or family, or teachers, or doctors.  That there's good people in the world, or people who need a bit of help, who are struggling as much as i am.  

I understand humans are social creatures that require connection, but from this week forwards, after this last betrayal?  Every time i need connection, to share a happy moment, to talk to someone, i'm just busying myself with work.  I'll distract myself until i stop needing people because one more betrayal, one more instance of someone i genuinely trusted using me and abandoning me like yesterday's trash, is going to fucking kill me.  I can't survive another, i don't think.  This has been the worst thing a self-proclaimed ""friend"" could have ever done to me.

It doesn't matter if i need connection.  I need to stop needing it if i want to survive.  And i've fought way too hard to keep myself alive since i was a child to give up now.

I'm not going to hurt and abandon anyone that hasn't been the person who hurt me; that's cruel.  But i'm engaging in speak only when spoken to protocol.  If someone needs something so far as they're decent people i'm not going to be a dick.  But every time that i, personally, ache to reach out?  Fuck that shit; it's time to watch a video, study more, read a book, or whatever.

I'm aware this is unhealthy but it's all i can do to keep myself stable until i get in therapy again.  I can't handle one more betrayal i feel like i'm dying.  I can't do trust anymore and i struggle to see myself ever being capable of it again.  Friendship is overrated when everyone is only using each other all the time."

I hit it off with a guy I met, we had similar interests, life goals, hobbies, etc. Was really funny, charming etc. Yet I was always ""paranoid"" that this was all an act and he would probably turn out to be a serial killer or something lol. 

So I was taking my precautions, as always, and when we were going to meet at a public place, I planned on taking my own transport. However, a friend was calling me paranoid for doing this and suggested he pick me up. So I gave him my address... and now I regret it. 

Turns out the bastard is married (found his insta), and I'm worried that if i tell the wife, he knows where to come and confront me...

Anyway, its my fault for being trusting i guess... yet family, friends, therapists, etc always call me aloof and distrusting of people. I think this is one of the many reasons why I'm like this... you clearly can't just trust new people you meet, sometimes you can't even trust close friends, and not even family. I've had so many friends abandon me over the years, even family who became abusive... etc... 

Yet apparently i have to change and become more trusting when time and time again people break whatever little trust i have?? "

Well- I was on prozac for a short time as a teen, and it helped while I recovered from being eating disordered, but outside of it helping for that, I didn't like how it felt. 

I am so tired of waking up every day and finding out if I feel okayish or if I'm f'd, ya know? It's not consistent.  I have bad dreams, and sometimes I don't sleep good. Neither of those help. I know according to Pete Walker, a lot can go on while we sleep and we can wake up in emotional flashbacks. I am SO TIRED of it though. It feels totally unfair to wake UP this way and need to try to climb out of the damned hole before the day even begins. 

Are you on meds?  How much do they help? Have you had to change your dose a lot? What I cannot do is drink (I am a kidney donor and alcohol is not my friend) and thc makes me puke. I tried and tried with delta 8's but it just does me in. 

The other thing that makes me wonder if they would help is that I don't have my ovaries. I'm on estrogen and that saves me, but our ovaries do more than just estrogen, so I wonder if a little boost would somehow help fill in some gaps.  

I'm in therapy twice a week, so I'm SUPER covered there. I'm well versed in IFS and mindful meditation, and dissociating and PMDD and attachment disorder stuff, I just need to have a longer break than one day (yesterday I felt semi okayish, for whatever that means for myself personally).

First post, I’m new here. Just learning about all of this and just starting my healing journey after struggling for many years not really understanding why I’ve had so much underlying anxiety and anger and sadness and confusion and everything else inside me - cPTSD. I’m finally getting professional help: it’s all very confusing… and painful. 

Anyway… I had this frustrating thing happen yesterday that I brought up to my therapist during my session and she explained something to me. So I wanted to ask you guys a question.

I was in the car (as a passenger) and the sun was really bright, so I had the sun visor down. The road was winding, so I had to keep adjusting the visor angle. It started to make me feel increasingly anxious, and then I started to get angry because I had to keep moving it. Like, I was getting super irritated, and feeling very anxious and panicked, I got really tense and irritable. It took me quite awhile to calm down after this fit. It made zero sense. WHY. It’s a stupid sun visor, and the sun. 

She explained trauma gets trapped in the body, and for whatever reason I had a trauma response to the sun and the visor yesterday. Sometimes you don’t need a reason. And she’d be surprised after everything I had been through if I didn’t have responses like that.

Anyway - my question for everyone here: what is a seemingly odd trauma response y’all have had that didn’t make sense at the time like my sun visor fit?"

Looking for some advice for how to speak to people who are angry or annoyed (both with something you've done or something else) and how to support them. 

Essentially, when a friend or partner is annoyed or angry with something I've done I find it incredibly hard to separate from that and give them responsibility to feel that outside of me having to fix it. Similarly, if they're just angry about something else entirely I can really shut down. I know this comes from anger in my childhood home being dangerous and volatile and it immediately results in a childlike fawn response which I'm finding annoys or angers friends more when they need support. 

I also don't know how to talk to them or support them in any way. I don't easily experience anger myself so I can't tap into any resource that way, i.e. What would I like to happen when I'm angry. 

So my question to you is, how do you support people who are angry or upset? How do you support your partners? I never know what to say and end up asking them questions about what they need even if they ask me not to and tell me it isn't helpful. 

I hope this makes sense!"

I was molested as a very, very young child. It happened a lot. I had several abusers over the course of my childhood, and repressed everything before age 12. 

I was a sitting duck for all the dangerously broken people in my life who needed to scratch a trauma itch. And then all of a sudden, right around age 12, the adults in my life, mainly my friend’s moms, started calling me a whore. I was shy as a mouse, frozen in dissociated terror 100% of the time. 
Edit: I was Mormon at the time, and I dressed like one. Not that it should matter, but matters to me that it’s known. It wasn’t my fault.  

My lightbulb: what if whatever CSA changes in a little girl’s psyche/nervous system/chemical make up, that identifies her as an easy victim to predators, is perceived by non-predators (but still sick mother fuckers.. who calls a 12 yo a whore?) as slut energy? 

It would explain a lot in my life. I was so painfully, painfully shy. You wouldn’t believe the consistency of whore rumors (or the variety thereof) that followed me throughout my adolescent/teen years. 

I sincerely hope there’s a special place in hell for people who further ostracize, ridicule, and humiliate CSA survivors, and then as a result set them up as a targets for more unwanted sexual contact they’re too dissociated to say no to. 

In my mind, people like that are like demented flying monkeys. They continue the work and legacy of the child rapists, long into the future, and make sure victims never have the safety, self-esteem, awareness, or support to get the help they need. IOW, they continue to silence on the predator’s behalf."

Just wondering if anyone has tips to overcome my (ir)rational fear of leaving my home because I'm afraid of being assaulted/harassed etc? 

Just for context, I'm still going out for work (it's only 10 mins away) and I'm still going out to have food etc. But, I have began to realise that I've been subconsciously rejecting the idea of leaving my home to a club/party/the mall etc basically places that harm can happen to me. It's really frustrating because I'm extroverted and I love going to these places. Sometimes when I feel well mentally, I do agree to go and have waves of irrational thoughts. I know these thoughts are valid because I have been assaulted in these places before (well, not a shopping mall but basically social spaces).

However, on one hand the hobbies I've developed at home has made me more of a hermit. I'm not complaining because these were hobbies that child-me couldn't participate in because of my abusive parents. But sometimes I feel like I've been hiding behind them because I'm too afraid to be assaulted again. 

I think my fear stems from the idea that I don't think I'm strong enough to withstand another kind of trauma happening to me. I'm too weak to endure another form of pain that I have no control over. I wish for a world that I'm able to dance, laugh & go out without worrying being traumatised again. Is that too much to ask for?"

I already deal with chronic pain from an unresolved pelvic injury and a myriad of aches and pains from endometriosis/ibs related issues. I've never been flexible, and I've always been super injury-prone (I pretty much sprain my right ankle every six months to a year). 

Saturday was the six-year anniversary of my estranged Mom's sudden passing. Between last Thurs and yesterday, I managed to strain two muscles (my left hamstring and my mid/upper back, like right by my shoulder blade.) The first I chalked up to poor form, but yesterday's pulling my back happened after the most LIGHT of workouts. Then I realized, my body is literally always at war with itself in some way. 

So, between the insane levels of cortisol coursing through my veins, and the trauma manifesting itself in the tightness of my muscles... does anyone else experience random muscle strains? Sprains? Like your body is just giving up on itself because it's so wound up?"
CPTSD,“My trauma is not that big”… Or is it?,191gwwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191gwwp/my_trauma_is_not_that_big_or_is_it/,https://www.reddit.com/user/may_saru,may_saru,2024-01-08 08:59:29,“My trauma is not that big”… Or is it?," I’m sure most if not all of us have had thoughts like this. I spent many years of my life thinking that the trauma I’ve been through couldn’t possibly count as trauma because it “wasn’t THAT bad”. 

 That being said, I’m much more understanding of other people talking about their trauma and when they act like it’s not a big deal, I’m taken aback at how relaxed they are about the horrible things they’ve been through. 

 In hindsight, my trauma is probably the reason I’m so scared of not doing something or not doing enough when I feel like someone is in trouble. It’s also probably why I’m so protective of kids and why I’m so mad when the adults around them are negligent/ abusive. 

 Is this something anyone else has experienced? (Realising the unbearable anger you had towards something/someone is deeply-rooted to your trauma)"

There’s so much more to it and so complex I can’t even get into it.

I’ve come to realize that who I am today isn’t really me per se, but the me that was shaped by all this shit. And I try to get better and get out of these habits and thoughts and routines but, and I start to, and then I just go right back into it, like I never left.

For anyone out there who has worked on their C-PTSD, how long did to take you to really get a hold on it? Does it get better?

The other day I was wondering why it was so difficult for me to form any relations with the new people I've been meeting at college, and then it hit me that I monitor everything I say.

A girl had asked if I wasn't close with my siblings, and rather than saying ""I'm not really close with them, no, but we're trying"" which is the truth, I just said ""Oh, hm, I don't know, I wouldn't say we're not close,"" and I was just vague. Of course, I don't have to share everything with every person I meet, but this is just one example I noticed of how I make every aspect of my personal life and myself vague and 'palatable.' It's so hard to connect with people when the only point where I share things about myself is when I'm 100% certain it is a thing they do too or don't mind.

I get so uncomfortable at the thought of being honest. It's like I have this need to separate my private life from my family life from my college life from my friend life. Like they're independent parts of me I cannot let mix, but maybe that's what makes me distant and impersonal, and therefore hard to connect to. I cannot pretend to be a whole person when I don't allow my whole person to exist. And exactly that is probably also why I'm not close with my siblings, I don't tell them about myself, just the general small talk.

I don't even know what to do to change it, because part of the reason I watch what I say is because I don't want to overshare the stuff I've been through, since that makes me insanely uncomfortable as well. I pretend to be the person who never went through any of it, but it's aspects of my whole life I'm burying when I do that."

The good and the bad, the causes, the psychology and the solutions. I'm not bad or good. I'm a victim but not an innocent one. I am selfish and I am very very sad. 

My timeline looks like this:

0-15 sexual abuse

15-16 ran away from abuse but then just sold my body to have a way to live 

17 son was born 

17-25 lots of physical and emotional abuse 

26 is the year I was safe. 

27 is when he stopped living with me. He can come back at any time I want. But I don't want. I don't want him here. I want to be able to kill myself if I decide so without having to arrange someone to pick him up from school and then coordinate somewhere for him to stay. He's already with someone safe now. I don't want him back because I can't afford him. I can't afford myself even. Heat and electricity are both $1000 behind. They're not off because it's illegal to turn it off in winter. Every other bill is always late or gone to collections. 

I tried to go to college but I have no passion. I have no interests. I have no drive. I just want to be not broken. My soul is like puss. It's an infection. I am like the puke you find in the stairwell in a parking garage. Theres nothing that can make a pile of slimy vomit appealing to pick up and take home and it is the same with me. Nearly every second of the day I am in pain because I know that I am only good to beat up or rape. I know that if hell existed, I would have to burn there for trillions of years just for my soul to be clean enough to deserve to be smiled at or hugged or kept safe. 

I just do gig jobs. It gets me enough money to live off of frozen fruit. I'm not going to get a better job because I am not going to put myself around men. I'm too scared of them and I will panic and hurt myself and just quit the job. Any time i see a man being nice to a woman I spiral for days. And that is often. I contacted so many resources but I can't afford even the cheapest therapist which is about $110 for 50 minutes around here. Im never going to make enough money to afford that. 'sliding scale' therapy doesn't exist here. 

Anyway i never felt any connection to my son. I don't hate him or dislike him. I feel very scared to think of him suffering. He's not suffering now. He was suffering with me. I wanted to love him so badly when he was a baby. I wanted to draw strength from being a mother. I wanted to find all this strength from no where and be a strong hard working single mom like all those other single moms. But I am just empty and feel nothing. I don't even think I'm human. I am an infection. I only deserve to get beat up. I hope I can bring myself to end my life soon.

If you want to say anything just please don't say something nice like that I'm not ruined or broken. That's true for most people but not for me and I don't expect anyone to understand. I am just trying this because I've been crying for about 4 days now non stop and I don't know what else to try and i have no one to talk to. "

In the 6 months since realising and beginning to process my childhood trauma, I haven’t used my teeth to clip my fingernails. I don’t remember making the conscious decision, I just stopped, and it’s weird.

Maybe it shows how much of an immature prick I am. Maybe it shows that as a child I craved a bit of control even if it meant sacrificing my health. Maybe it means I’m healing. Maybe it’s Maybelline. Deno, but it feels strange to have long fingernails and to have to use nail clippers."
CPTSD,Split upbringings?,191fbho,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191fbho/split_upbringings/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Anonymous-tossaway,Anonymous-tossaway,2024-01-08 07:12:16,Split upbringings?,"I haven't really been able to find someone with my experience yet, searches just lead me to posts with related keywords but completely different content, so here I am. 

My parents split when I was two, so from my earliest available memories, this was always how it was. My parents were friendly, but not friends, they were easily able to talk coparenting but didn't communicate if it didn't directly pertain to me. I have no trauma or negative thoughts on this, specifically.

I spent most of my time with my mom, who was amazing and the best parent I could have possibly asked for. To this day, (early 20's now) she is everything I could need and want from a parent.

I spent alternate weekends with my dad, who was a good enough parent but somewhat of a pushover. He was definitely more of a Disney Dad, and was more focused on enjoying his limited time with me than being an actual parent. He basically let me do whatever I want, most rules and boundaries set by my mom did not apply at his house, and there were plenty of times he would encourage or allow me to go behind my mom's back and do things I wasn't allowed to, like putting me on the back of his motorcycle starting around age 9, but I know he loves and cares for me, and did his best. BUT, enter my (former) stepmother. He married her when I was 5, and they remained together until I was 14. 

I can confidently say her presence in my life is the cause of 95% of my childhood trauma, the remaining % being things from school or other non-home environments. And my dad, being in an abusive and unhealthy relationship of his own with her, became her enabler. Between her, and my older stepbrothers, I was constantly belittled, insulted, dismissed, treated as a dress-up doll with no bodily autonomy, 0 privacy, and a number of other things. I was fortunately never hit (by her, my brothers did though) or sexually abused but I *was* physically violated in a number of other ways that showed a complete lack of regard for or willful discarding of my autonomy, privacy, and personhood. 

And my dad would play both sides, he would emphasize with me and act like he understood and would apologize on their behalf, and would correct my brothers performatively, and occasionally push back on my stepmom, but was unable or unwilling to do anything meaningful to protect me in any real way, so this cycle repeated every single visit for almost 10 years
.
I was also adultified in that regard, from a too young age I was an ear for his marital problems; always hearing about her putting him in debt and fucking other men and constantly giving him shit etc., things that a child shouldn't have put onto them, because I was ""mature for my age"" (gee, wonder why.) 

And I would go back to my mom's house, and while she did know I hated going, I was too young to be able to express exactly what was happening over there and how deeply it was affecting me. I am also autistic, but wasnt diagnosed until much later, so I had limited ability to even fully process those feelings to begin with, let alone explain them. As I've gotten older I've been able to reiterate the stories I told her over the years in a much more accurate and complete way and my mom was horrified to hear everything she wasn't able to see at the time, especially because anything she DID feel the need to address with my dad back then was easily explained away or dismissed by him in a way that made it sound just generally annoying, but not traumatizing or harmful to me. 

So essentially, I experienced two exactly opposite upbringings. I had, for the most part, a beautiful home life, with a mother who made me feel safe, seen, supported, accepted, encouraged, and loved. She gave me everything she had and then some. I was taught healthy habits, communication, and behaviors. I had structure. And I hold no negativity in my heart towards her for sending me over there, because had she *known*, she would have done everything in her power to protect me, and even not knowing nearly the extent, still took small steps to try and improve things over there when she could.

But then I would go to my dad's and all of that would be promptly undone. I experienced the exact opposite of everything i just wrote about my mom, and again, this cycle would repeat every two weeks for 10 years. 


As a result, I feel like I have a split personality without the split personality. There are two separate, opposite people inside of me. The one who knew only love, and the one who knew only hurt. And as much as it kills me, it feels like the traumatized me won out for the most part, despite being statistically a much smaller percentage of my childhood, time-wise.

And for the life of me, I havent found this experience mirrored anywhere else and and I don't know what the hell to do with it. Even people I see who kind of relate, their 'good parent' *knew* what was happening and either ignored it or refused to see it, and it soured the relationship to some extent, which isn't the case at all for me. 

I don't really know how to end this post, I guess I'm just looking for any others who grew up like this, and have any insight or just want to relate."

And selective empathy?,"Sometimes people will use their own trauma to invalidate you, or cross your boundaries. 

For example someone is being condescending towards you, call them out on it and they say something like ""i do not apreciate the way you are engaging with me, it is how my narcissistic parent engages with me"". Basically implying you are a narcissist, but after they have been abusive. 

Or if you state an opinion and someone uses their experience to invalidate yours. This one is difficult cause the statement is usually so emotionally heavily loaded you cant say anything without coming across as an absolute asshole. 

And how do you cope with selective empathy. Usually when people form a mob, even if its a small one, their empathy becomes highly selective. And it doesnt matter if you are a victim or not, it also doesnt matter what you are saying. If they have their sights set on you, anything goes and they usually dont even realise they are being abusive either. They validate each other and cheer each other on to bully someone, they dogpile on a person. You would think this just happends in schools, which is already traumatising. But adults are no strangers to these, i've seen it happen time and time again. It's almost as if some people like having a common enemy, a black sheep. Maybe its a coping mechanism to not become a target, but if you have become the target how do you cope with this? If you have a mental breakdown they just point at you like ""look see told you, crazy person!"" If you dont respond you are either cast out of the group as a whole or silently suffering."

CPTSD,A childcare professional told me a bunch of nonsense and reminded me of the banality of evil,191ecem,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191ecem/a_childcare_professional_told_me_a_bunch_of/,https://www.reddit.com/user/moonrider18,moonrider18,2024-01-08 06:11:54,A childcare professional told me a bunch of nonsense and reminded me of the banality of evil,"A while back I met a guy I'll call ""Bob"".

Bob is not a therapist per se, but he does work with children professionally. Families pay him for his advice on how to deal with very troubled children, including those that self-harm and those that become violent towards others.

Recently Bob told me about his approach to helping children, and I thought to myself ""This is the face of evil"".

Let's be clear: Bob is a nice guy in many ways. If you met him he'd seem perfectly normal, affable and even generous. He makes special efforts to connect people in his community by hosting large parties, and he gets along well with everyone. I've even seen him interact with children (non-professionally) and he seemed pretty reasonable.

But when I say that he reminded me of ""The Face of Evil"", what I mean is evil is typically not obvious. Evil ideas can be found in otherwise good people, and those ideas can go unchallenged for decades on end, even if they do incredible damage in the meantime.

For instance, think of the traditional treatment of gay people and consider that many millions of homophobic bigots were *otherwise good people*, good friends and neighbors to anyone who wasn't gay. Consider that many of these same people had genuinely good intentions for their gay friends (assuming they discovered any), but their bigoted beliefs twisted good intentions into horrible actions.

I say this as a queer person myself, btw. And of course there are plenty of openly sadistic homophobes in the world. But it's the quiet bigots that catch my attention just now.

I have personal experience being a person who *thinks* he's doing the right thing when *actually* he's doing the wrong thing. =(

---

Anyway, recently I spoke to Bob about how he deals with troubled children. He recited what was obviously a well-practiced spiel that he presumably gives to clients when they first hire him. His delivery was calm and confident, and *full of bullshit*.

He had one point that sounded good before it turned bad. He said that everyone expects him to teach the kid Anger Management, but that's not the solution. He said that kids get angry because they're in *pain*, and you have to address that first.

At this point I thought ""Good! Some compassion for children."" But then he took a wild turn. He said the way to deal with a kid's pain was to make sure that *the pain of disobedience is always greater than the pain of obedience*. In other words, punishment is the only solution.

He gave an example of a kid who doesn't want to do a chore and curses out the parent. The answer is to take away the kid's phone, only giving it back to her once the chore is done. Bob explained that the pain of losing the phone is greater than the pain of doing the chore, and thus the kid will do the chore.

Bob gave no thought whatsoever as to whether the chore was reasonable in the first place. Bob did not care to ask whether the child might be in pain for other reasons unrelated to the chore. In fact, Bob was *explicitly* disinterested in the reasons behind the child's anger and distress.

Bob told me to interlace my fingers, then asked why I do it that way and not the other way (with the other thumb on top). He said that people don't know why they interlace their fingers a certain way, and then generalized this to *nobody knows why they do anything*. He said that if you ask kids why they act out they'll never have an answer for you. He also said that adult alcoholics have no idea why they're driven to drink so much. He said the answer in all cases was to *deliberately avoid getting insight into someone's pain or motivation* and focus entirely on the behavior itself. And the only way to alter behavior is to induce punishment for disobedience.

I work with kids too, in a different context. In my experience, kids are *quite* willing to tell you what's bothering them *if you only listen*!!! If you establish yourself as a trustworthy person who actually cares about them and has no interest in needlessly bossing them around, *then* they will open up about their problems.

But Bob isn't interested in hearing about a kid's problems. Bob is interested in *obedience*.

Bob gave his whole speech in a calm, confident and well-practiced manner. There wasn't a trace of cruelty anywhere on his face. But all the same, he was remarkably cruel.

PEOPLE PAY FOR THIS!

People pay *good money* for a guy to tell them how to be a jerk to their own children. People pay *good money* for bullshit advice delivered with confidence. It's no wonder why my childhood was so fucked up, when the community tolerates and even encourages absolute bullshit like this. My parents never met Bob, but he's emblematic of a bigger cultural problem. Bob-style *ideas* are floating around everywhere, and children like me are effectively erased.

Most people don't even register ""anti-child bias"" as a possibility. We know that racism exists and sexism exists and homophobia exists, but the idea that there's a bias against *children* hardly ever seems to enter the public mind, despite all the obvious evidence. (See here for instance: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201805/children-s-teens-suicides-related-the-school-calendar )

As for me? I kept a straight face during the entire spiel. I probed a little, asked a couple leading questions, but ultimately I didn't challenge Bob at all. Why? Because I can't afford to lose him. I need to keep going to the events he hosts, not only for my sake, but also for the sake of the neighborhood children who come along too.

I talked to several of those kids when Bob was out of earshot, and told them of how the world (particularly the schools) doesn't respect children's rights. I focused on [Sudbury Schools](https://www.facebook.com/HudsonValleySudburySchool/videos/10155951019968804/) as an example of how to do things better.

The kids were overjoyed to hear my ideas, to hear that there are others like me in the world, and to hear that there's a better way to live.

I wish I'd had that experience when I was young. I wish that child-me had met somebody like adult-me. It might have saved me from an incredible amount of pain. =(

Go live in my car, camping for free on BLM and USFS land.

But after I had already begun to get everything ready, I had this last minute thought that I should give humanity one last chance. It has gone worse than ever before. 

I feel like I betrayed my child self, and the promise I made that I would never force him (me) to endure the hell this long. That I would find an escape. That I would get us (me) out of all this and we (I) could just go live out in the wilderness with the only place that ever seems to fit. Nature. 

But then I did this stupid stupid stupid thing, and tried to give humanity another chance. It's like I moved into a hive of wendigos, a pestilence of bullies. 

So now my last escape route is gone. 

My suicide treaty ends in 8 days and the only thing between myself and the end is a confirmation above every other confirmation that this is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but the only solution to a permanent problem. 

I would plead with all of you to not make the same mistakes. 

If you ever have the chance to escape and live out your final years in the wilderness, please don't trade that option to give humanity another chance. They are never going to change. Our child selves were right all along - humans are not reliable, humans are not trustworthy, the bullies will always betray you, hide, hide from them all, never trust anyone, go, go be with the natural world. There is more respect in even a blackbear than ever could be found in this garbage culture, garbage nation, garbage people. The only interact with you because they want something from you.

Be warned of America. It's a hive of wendigos. They'll devour you. 

I hope you can escape. 

I'm sorry I gave away my ability to."

whenever i even just think about my old middle school i get stressed out because i was struggling so much back then. Even though its been years since i left that school, it still just makes me mad, even tho i had a somewhat better experience than other people there. 

I had such severe social anxiety (even before covid) and online school completely ruined my mental health for most of grade 8. i was pretty much scared to be in my grade 8 class in-person because it was mostly only boys in the class which for some reason im rly uncomfortable with, and because grade 8 was when i found out i was bi, and everyone in the class had the same religion as me and was homophobic. i really hated myself so much that year. there is also one more thing which im not comfortable sharing, but it involved me having an addiction to something i was very ashamed of.

even though its been many years (im gr11 now) i still get genuinely mad whenever i think abt that year or just the school in general. not only was i struggling that whole year, but it also took me a long time and so much effort to get better socially and to somewhat like myself more, which im still not satisfied with.

but i just feel embarrassed that im still hung up over things that happened so long ago, and that i dont really have a specific someone to blame. does anyone else feel this way?"

If there’s someone getting bullied, most people will join in or gaslight the victim rather than stand up for them. Etc. I just hate being around people the majority of the time. Even being on social media really sucks because most people are assholes if anyone says something they disagree with, etc. It bothers me to see it directed at anyone and it bothers me that people can walk around acting this way towards others and still be celebrated"

But I got hooked on watching his pretty face and megawatt bulb smile and getting my shitty life story validated. As a therapist he was awful. No sense of how important safety and trust is for trauma patients. I both dreaded the sessions and looked forward to being in his presence. Im also old AF, so I should have known so much better.

I would really like to get this out.

Partner has had enough of me and today I told them we'll be going our separate ways when the lease for our current place is up. (March) I have been going between crying and dissociative. I feel a little lucid right now. 

They don't know how to ""handle"" me anymore and they feel like they're becoming a bad partner because of the way they're being affected by my own trauma. 

We have been together almost six years and the last two years have been incredibly hard. I thought it was just about covid and things might get better but their depression has gotten worse despite making efforts to change their lifestyle to better accommodate their identity. For a long time they have been a great partner, we are both neurodivergent and understand the problems that can come with that. 

I've been getting treatment for my CPTSD a d have made huge progress in my own sense of the world.

But today they broke down over a silly meme I shared. It was just a drawing of a frog that said ""I know I have responsibilities but honestly I'm a little brain damaged for the rest of my life, I hope you understand"" I just enjoyed the sort of gallows humour of being a recovering drug addict, having cptsd, and, in quite a literal sense, head trauma from being assaulted. I said it on my Facebook because I'm friends with a lot of other traumatized, recovered addicts, and frankly, brain damaged people or those who think of themselves as brain damaged. So we all had a little giggle over it. 

One of the issues that they've had to go through is dealing with the second-hand trauma after being told my story. They can't fathom the evil in the world. They can't fathom, somebody going through those things still being here today. I've tried getting them to counselling but they had a bad experience with the first counsellor and doesn't want to try again.

I think they finally realised that I'm never going to get better. Despite my resilience. That things will never truly be okay and that no matter how far away from what I've been through, my brain is rewired because of trauma and it doesn't matter WHAT I or they do, it's always going to be there. 

I also have some physical disabilities that are getting worse. Back problems, neck problems, internal problems. It's just been an ongoing thing and it's not going to change, it's not going to improve. The things I used to be able to do, that I thought I could reclaim someday, I won't ever be able to do them again. It's just gonna get worse and today they finally realized that. I told them to run many times over the years. I guess they finally realised they have to in order to save themselves. 

Today will have the lyrics of ""Margot Robbie"" by Xavier Dunn and Eluera on repeat in my head. 

""I'm so sick of being a little too much. For everyone I love. Over-filling the cups and then drowning. How did I allow this? I'm so sick of everything I touch. Turning to dust, Try to keep us together but I'm fatal. Oh, is this too painful?""

If you read this far, thank you for letting me get it out."
CPTSD,I don't have a cool interesting title. I just need to spill my guts for a bit,191czeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191czeu/i_dont_have_a_cool_interesting_title_i_just_need/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Tactical_Gam3r,Tactical_Gam3r,2024-01-08 04:55:51,I don't have a cool interesting title. I just need to spill my guts for a bit,"First thing I don't know what to say but fuck it. I'm so tired, and I mean extremely unfucking believably emotionally drained. I feel so depressed, angry, exhausted and just dead.

Part of me wants to go completely berserk, like tear someone's head off and beat them to death with it while screaming till my face turns blue and killing anything that I can get my hands on. 
Another part of me wants to just cry and cry and cry and cry and just disappear, not like dying but full on stop existing entirely.
And another part of me just wants to know what the fuck I did to never experience love or even safety, be treated like a slave by my parents a freak by other people and a sex toy by pedophiles.

I feel so fucking lonely, like hire a prostitute just to be held or make a life like replica of my crush and makeout with since she was the only person in my life that has ever showed me kindness or compassion or like she wasn't going to torment me just for fun and drive me to suicide just to watch me suffer and I'm losing hope in the dating scene since my last ""relationship"" was me dating a girl I never met before because some creepy student that liked making me uncomfortable making sexual moans and thrusting as if he was fucking my ass and refused to stop even after I told him several times to stop and that I don't find it funny and that I find it unsettling and disturbing.

And even if I do somehow get a real girlfriend I'm pretty sure my csa trauma from a homeless man molesting me and trying to rape me will end up driving the girl away leaving me alone with no one.

And it infuriates me when my friends tell me that ""don't worry about getting a girlfriend"" well no, I will worry because my family never loved me, the closest thing to a father I've ever had is dead, my house cat got put down by my parents because the cat showed me unconditional love.

Secondly I'm unemployed and finding a job is like pulling teeth. I've put billions and billions and billions of applications out and haven't got anything out of it. Employment agencies have not been helping no matter what I do. I feel like I'm going batshit insane just staying in my house all the time.

And with everything costing an arm and a leg it feels like even if I get a job ill have to work for so long before I could afford even the cheapest stuff.

Thirdly is for over a year my right eye has been completely messed up. It's red swelling it hurts and mucus keeps coming out. I've seen my family doctor 3 times and now I'm seeing an eye doctor or whatever they're called because I've been proscribed topical antibiotics 3 times and nothing helped. A part of me wants to just claw it out and say problem solved because I'm tired of dealing with it.
Usually my body would have no problem with healing, hell I've jumped of a moving golfcart because a group of people said that if I did they'd be my friend and my stupid ass was so desperate to have friends so without any hesitation I jumped off, and I healed quickly, but now thanks to stress premature aging and other stuff I don't heal as quickly or even heal at all. I'm 21 and I feel like I'm FAR past my prime. 
I'm a young man I should be at physical peak but instead I'm in constant pain and my body's falling apart even as my youth is the only thing holding me together. When I wipe, blood, when I blow my nose, blood, when I brush my teeth, blood.
I feel like I'm slowly dying while something refuses to let me die. Just endless torment.

Fourthly is nothing brings me happiness anymore. No matter what I do I don't get any pleasure from it. I get a tiny barely noticeable amount of dopamine or serotonin and then it's gone as fast as it came like I felt something different for a nanosecond and then back to nothing but the darkness filling my mind like a black cloud of despair hovering over me. Like a phantom in my head that I'll never fully understand.

Fifthly I've been ""seeing"" a therapist but my last visit was in September and I haven't had any contact from them since and when I contacted them they said they'd contact me and nothing so I feel like I've just been abandoned and betrayed like I was so meaningless like I was not worth the dirt on their shoe. And what pisses me off more is that it's the second place I've contacted.
The first therapist I filled out a registration form 3 times and each time I waited the 5 day waiting period the form said and after that I switched to the therapist I'm going to now.

Sixthly is I don't know if I'll get any hate but I'm just going to put it out there. I'm not happy about what people like louder with crowder and other conservative outlets are saying about anything gay related like the pope not condemning homosexuality.
I'm a conservative or right wing but now I question if I should still consider myself politically right or just leave.
I agree with some right wing view points like I'm pro gun and pro life but I'm caedromantic [Ace because of trauma] so does that make me bad even though I believe in the right to bare arms for protecting yourself and believe in that every unborn child deserves life.
I agree with some of their opinions but does me not being completely straight after being molested make me bad or evil.
Now I don't know if I want to associate with right wingers in any way, most of them just seem to start becoming more and more crazy or deranged.
And the only reason I've ever called myself a conservative is because I find or at least found the political right as slightly more tolerable but now I feel like I don't want to be anywhere political since it feels like both sides are just two sides of the same coin just with different faces.

Sorry for the long post. I just needed to get a lot out. If you've made it this far and haven't crucified me because of the last bit, thanks.
Also if this post causes any drama or problems I'll delete it."

I've been remembering more moments and started to find connecting threads and it makes me feel like a detective like I'm trying to research someone else's life to figure out why and who they are. Most of what I find kinda sucks and today's discovery was no different.  

I asked my mom today ""why did you decide to have me"" I've always thought they didn't want me. That i was a waste of space and that she had me to get the approval of her own abusive parents and the cult we were apart of. I was right. There was more than i thought though about my early early life and it's kind of messing with me I don't know how to sort and process the information i got.

She told me ""i had you cause i wanted to take the next step in my relationship, i knew it was something i should do kind of an inevitability. I've always hated kids even when i was a kid myself I've always hated them. They were loud annoying and gross. when your father talked about the possibility of not being able to have kids i was overjoyed at the possibility. But we had you and i was excited, you were so sweet and quiet i had a great time when you were really young. I went back to my job and worked until you were eight months old letting your aunt take care of you. She was great until she told me how cute you cousin was beating you up, pulling your hair, hitting you, slapping you. After that i quit my job and we had a lot of fun playing and cleaning and sorting things but you slept a lot strangely usually like 17 hours a day. Things changed when your brother was born. You were such a quiet angel of a kid i was not ready at all for your Brother. It's totally your fault for not preparing me for the insanity that is your brother. At that point i didn't do great taking it my frustrations and exploding out of stress.""

I hate that i was right about why she had me and how little it actually came down to wanting a kid and more to improving her relationship and satisfying her family. But the fact my cousin "" beat the shit out of me"" for months as an infant kinda came out of left field. I've always hoped that maybe my infancy at least wasn't filled with hurt. It sucks to be proven incorrect about that.

Idc. She hurt me. Just because she birthed me, doesn't excuse her behaviour. Just because she's my mother, doesn't make the abuse *okay* in anyway. 

My mother thrives on forgiveness because she told me herself; after she slept with her best friend husbands (multiple husbands of different friends), blackmailing her own friends, committed fraud at work... ""I'm so glad they forgave me because I can do it again. That's why jesus died for our sins. I can be forgiven and I can do it again and again and again. That's why jesus died for me"".

Over the past 9 months I've gotten a bit better at noticing certain emotions, but I usually don't know what to do with them.

Currently, I'm feeling some old emotions I had a child. A sort of empty sadness/badness at my mother's mental struggle, and sorrow for how much she suffers from it. In the past I'd probably try to cheer myself up or distract myself, because I really don't want to give my mother's mental health struggles any more of a grasp on my own mental health than they already do. But maybe that's part of my repression, and not actually healthy. I dunno.

Is it acceptable (or good) to just sit with a sadness when you're feeling it? Without going for distractions like food/treats/TV/gaming/exercise/hobbies etc?

Or is just sitting on an emotion for no sake other than to feel it unhealthy dwelling/ruminating?"

I don’t know if I’m grieving, burned out, or some of both, but I’ve constantly felt like I was treading water for the past couple of years. My heart just feels broken. I make myself, but I don’t want to get out of bed. I try really hard to count my blessings (because I still have a lot to be grateful for) but every aspect of life feels like a chore. Everything just feels so….dull? I just feel disconnected from everything and everyone, aside from very few people. It’s also destroyed previously very close friendships. 

I want to take action and accountability where I can make changes, while also accepting what I cannot. I’m tired of living like this. But, I find that forcing myself to just “push through” and “fake it” is only burning me out further. The stress is causing both severe anxiety and exhaustion. 

I feel cringe just writing this. But it feels safer to talk about things with strangers, especially strangers who “get it.”

For some reason, I’ve been very reluctant to even have this conversation with my (trauma based, highly trained in EMDR and somatic modalities) therapist. It feels like an uphill battle to get an official diagnosis and medication, and that deters me from the start.

I grew up in a household where I experienced and witnessed all manners of abuse by my narcissist and BPD and alcoholic dad. I left my home state over a decade ago, but he moved 9 doors down from me and my partner three months ago, and the trauma memory floods and triggers have been … very overwhelming since. 

Just hoping to hear some words of encouragement and/or advice from those who are further down the road. I’ve been in therapy for 17 years with success in EMDR, journaling, and somatic experiencing. However that was for working through relationship issues and treating generalized anxiety disorder. It wasn’t until 2020 that I started to learn about and suspect I have CPTSD. 

Thanks in advance for any encouragement!"

I'm afraid she's going to tell me I'm a helpless case, that I don't want to get better and her time would be better spent helping others. Or maybe she won't be equipped to help me or won't understand what my problem is. 

It was really hard for me to get up the courage to seek out more help and I'm feeling like if it doesn't work out I'll be devastated and I can't take one more hit right now, I'm already at a very low point. I know I need support and I'm so scared that I'm about to learn it isn't available or possible or I don't deserve it.

I know this is a cognitive distortion, I'm only considering what can go wrong, not what could go right. But if I imagine what could go right, I'll be even more crushed if it doesn't. 

This feels so vulnerable. I've always believed I could get better but I guard that little spark of hope very carefully and I feel like I just threw the door open and all the wind is blowing in and I don't know what will happen.

I am a 19 year old and over the last few years I’ve recognized bitter anger is a theme in my life. My partner was not nice to me in the past and would often call me names belittle me and admitted to saying hurtful things solely for the purpose of hurting me. That stopped about 8 months ago and she’s in therapy now for her own issues. Since then I’ve developed my own issues specifically with anger and if I’m being 1000% honest I’m regularly angry and yell at my partner over little things and often to the point my heart pounds. On top of this the shame of guilt often leads to blame shifting and trying to flip the script. When we met I was calm collected and could deal with just about anything without raising my voice. I’d like to blame my anger  partially on how I was treated in the past and how often the only time she’d stop calling me names was if I yelled at her and demanded she stopped but that isn’t the sole contributor.  This is no longer the case but now every time a situation arises I start yelling at her and it isn’t okay. I also have recognized I am treating my partner in similar ways that I saw my father treat his partner and my partner and I regularly trigger each others past truama. My question is what do I do? How do I stop getting triggered by my partner and how do I stop perpetuating the behavior of my father.
CPTSD,I don't trust hetero men,191810t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/191810t/i_dont_trust_hetero_men/,https://www.reddit.com/user/cpsdont,cpsdont,2024-01-08 00:53:16,I don't trust hetero men,"Hello,

let me preface this by the following: I've never experienced any serious sexual harrassment or assault, at least not that I can remember. I'm an asexual woman, so I've never had any sexual experience or interest, either. 

The thing is, I'm extremely wary of men. I have a lot of guy friends and I'm 99% sure none of them have any romantic or sexual interest in me. I've gone on a few dates with (mostly) asexual men, but even with the asexual ones, there was always that voice in my head that told me not to trust them, that they might want to take advantage of me or even sexually assault me. It's so weird because I really don't think I'm especially attractive, but I know that sexual assault has little to do with sex or attraction, so it wouldn't matter anyway.

I usually just live my life keeping my hetero male friends at a bit of a distance. I **know** rationally that none of them pose any threats, but I **feel** differently. My problem now is that I have a good friend (we've known each other over 10 years now) who moved away a few years ago and he's been asking me to come visit him forever. He wants me to stay at his place, but because of this issue I've avoided visiting him - but I actually would want to! But there's this voice in the back of my head telling me that it could be dangerous and he could do anything he wanted if I stayed at his place. Doesn't help that he's a big, strong guy with a high sex drive lol but he knows I'm asexual and has never shown any interest and I'm definitely not his type. And let's pretend for a moment that he is interested, I **know** that he'd still not hurt me like that. There was never anything indicating that he'd overstep any boundaries with me, he has a girlfriend (who doesn't live with him), so I know it's irrational to fear him. The worst part is, I'm so ashamed about it that I can't bring it up in therapy.

I do feel this with lesbian friends just a little bit as well - but because they're women and physically not as intimidating I'm better at ignoring those fears, I think.

Can anyone relate? I feel like it's sooo irrational that I can't bring it up in therapy, I'm ashamed about it, but I'm not sure why... Is this just my regular trust issues taking up a very bold fom? Or is this something different? I probably should bring this up in therapy, right?

My mother experienced a lot of creepy men in her life (she sometimes talks a bit about it but I don't think she's ever told me everything) and she is always extremely wary, telling me to be cautious, etc., so maybe it's really her fears I integrated as mine?

Any advice is welcome, especially encouragement to talk about this in therapy."

CPTSD,Is attention seeking a bad thing?,1917frt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1917frt/is_attention_seeking_a_bad_thing/,https://www.reddit.com/user/lzrdmnd,lzrdmnd,2024-01-08 00:27:04,Is attention seeking a bad thing?,"This is more of a kind of thought prompt as its not based on a real situation or anything, but I was wondering what you all think about the concept of attention seeking, and whether or not you believe it to be a negative or positive trait.

Obviously, being ""attention seeking"" is often used as an insult. Something as innocent as wearing alternative fashion makes you a desperate attention seeker, as does something as big as attempting to take your own life. It's always used in a negative context, as if seeking attention is one of the most shameful things you could do as a person.

As people with cptsd, attention is something several of us were particularly lacking in our lives, or we received a lot of the wrong kind of attention. A lot of traumatized people isolate to avoid *any* kind of attention, while some may use manipulative behaviors to obtain as much attention as possible, sometimes unintentionally. 

Do you believe that there is a middle ground of attention seeking behavior that is healthy and normal? Is attention seeking at its core an unhealthy trait? What healthy ways do you think people can seek attention, if it's possible to do so?"

A child who viewed his dad as the hero in his own little story. 

The story you made up to make people pity you.

The courts were against you,

CPS was against you,

My mom was against you,

Everyone was against you.

But,

You did nothing wrong right?

You never did a single thing wrong right?

All those times police were called you were the victim.

All those times you tried to hurt yourself to make us feel bad? 

You’re the victim right? 

Always playing the victim when you’re in fact the abuser. 

A wolf in sheep’s clothing-

The perfect disguise to hide your true intentions. 

You’re a horrible person. 

A horrible man.

A horrible father. 

Horrible.

My therapist emailed me yesterday to tell me she has accepted a new job and won't be seeing patients any longer. My thoughts are all over the place at this point and I don't know what I'm going to do.

I know she is an adult and our relationship is strictly business and she can make any career choice she likes. She doesn't owe me any care or long term anything. 

At the same time, I'm feeling hurt, angry, abandoned. I'm not sure if I want to do a 'termination session' or just reply and cancel our next session.

I don't feel like I have it in me to go through the 'lets go over your trauma history' with another therapist at this point.

The last few sessions I've felt like things have become argumentative - I was thinking this was me, that I'm resisting progress - wondering what the point of therapy even was... but now I'm wondering if she has been only partially present because she's been on the search for a job. 

Now that I think about it, in our last session, she was dressed much more 'business-like' than usual, which makes me think she had an interview that day and got the job offer yesterday. 

Of course the intrusive thoughts are coming on strong - maybe she got sick of dealing with me and the only way to get out was to go find another job. Maybe she doesn't have another job and she just wants to get rid of me with an excuse that she won't have to say that I'm too shitty a patient to deal with."

In that time I was referred to a therapist--a psychoanalyst but not for actual analysis. It was far and away the most vulnerable time of my adult life and I became way, way too dependent on this guy and could not see at the time that he was actually encouraging (manipulating) me into being that way. Including convincing me I should come twice and then three times a week for a few years. I was absolutely convinced that this brilliant man had the royal road to healing and stuck with it for nine years. Yes, nine. And then I was, after being stuck and unemployed for most of that time, finally out of money. When I told him I needed to take a break until I could make some money he hit the roof. As in, literally red in the face, ""No one does this to me!"" It turns out he has hurt others and I don't think malignant narcissist is too strong a term. The worst of it (as if that's not bad enough) is that it was a recapitulation in many ways of what had happened to me as a kid. My mother was (as much as I'm wary of the term, which can be pretty stigmatizing) borderline and profoundly manipulative. Well, also brilliant. Hence the blinders that kept me from seeing the therapy abuse.

Along the way, I had also tried psychedelic therapy. In part because I thought I had this amazing, rock solid therapist behind me. It did help me got off the antidepressants but I got caught up in two psychedelic communities that, again, I couldn't see, were really not good at all. (The leaders of one community actually had an entire podcast on Spotify built around their abusive behavior.) Same blinders, same, or at least similar, recapitiulation.

What else to say? I somehow started to pull myself together and gradually over several years go from being a complete wreck to being in a lot of ways pretty good but way way too isolated and still unemployed. Friends kind of peeled away and I had trouble making new ones. I had the awful luck of selling my house just before the pandemic--in order to spend time in a Zen monastery, that also turned out to be pretty awful--and finally, with some recent inheritance, managed last summer to just be able to buy a small house (prices really skyrocketed here) that needs work last summer after having temporary rentals and house-sitting for three years. But it appears that having my own home again, especially one that needs a lot of work, is not giving me the platform for a final rebuilding phase that I had hoped. And it's winter here in New England which is really tough and I cannot seem to even get a job. The cptsd, narrow window of tolerance and all that, plus having a stellar resume (three Ivy League degrees) that just fell off a cliff twelve years ago, all becomes terribly limiting. And I keep getting dinged from even really basic jobs--like coffee shops or part-time driving people to medical appointments at a retirement community. I think people see my resume and think, WTF? and just toss it.

Oh right. I should say that after all that, I probably had 8 or 10 false starts with new therapist in the last several years. The good ones are few and far between, and my history and resistance and lack of money makes it incredibly hard to find a good match. I finally worked for the past year with a youngish guy who does internal family systems. I like him and trust him, but I cannot seem to get anywhere with IFS. The deeper stuff is just totally buried over now. And even if I could, I'm back to being seriously out of money. All three of my siblings, all older, care and would like to help (well...sort of...to a point), but I can feel all the old family dynamics still there and feel like I can't take it anymore. (Like, for example, they have between them probably between 10 and 20 million dollars. When I was frantically trying to find a small, cheap place to buy they would say things like ""I wish I could help!"")

Oh right, last thing. (Sorry for the length!) I decided to apply for a masters of divinity program. No, I'm not at all capital-R religious, but I do think that with the shit storm going down in the world there's widespread spiritual crisis (not least as the religion of capitalism falls apart...) and really important work to do in that regard, and also I tend to think the main thing I really need is just some decent, interesting people to be around who are not afraid to talk about the big questions in life. So maybe that will work? But the process was incredibly grueling getting the application together, with a lot riding on it, especially the scholarship aid--the application needed to be really good. And I got kind of frantic....just a little at the end, but enough that I made a choice for my academic writing sample that wasn't great...not terrible, but not what I should've chosen, and you would not believe the way my internal critic came out late that night and just beat the crap out of me. And since then, well, it's winter, and I have no friends, and I'm broke, and it's getting hard to see a way out and I've been really depressed and that window of tolerance has narrowed. And sort of cabin-fever late at night in a kind of scary way, and there's something more than depression...kind of a turmoil....in my head at times. Not dramatic, but it feels kinda bad. All of which I know can change, but the fact is that there's this objective component of...getting old, no money, can't get it together, and...WTFingF is next?

I've done some humanitarian aid work in a remote part of southern AZ with immigrants and know there are people there who'd welcome me back and I could buy a cheaper house and have some money for a while to keep working on things but sheesh, I don't really want to go live among cacti in the middle of nowhere. Oof! Any thoughts?"

I want to learn about what everyone's family structures were like so that I can understand about the different ways trauma manifests in society's foundational unit, and ways how children cope and survive in a world that doesn't always come easy for unconventional family structures - some examples:

- Two parents, one parent, extended family, foster family
- Only child, child among multiple/a lot of siblings
- Grew up in an adoption center
- Ran away from home and built a life of own

I said enough. Nothing I do will be enough for this person to treat me right when I was feeling good. 

I got out and was healing. Met someone again who was everything I was hoping for. Then again I found myself feeling insecure even though I do love myself. 

I don’t want his mood, words or actions to have such an impact on me. So I am taking a step back and really focusing on what I love about myself, what I want to work on, and what I want to do to feel independent and secure.

Said she felt upset but everyone she spoke to said not to tell her, that they stopped cheating and the 2 women became such good friends.  Today, when talking about politics, she said that Trump is better than Biden. She said Biden looks scary and is a pedophile. I got so triggered and I walked out of the room abruptly - I said that I wondered if she was even smart after some of the comments she makes about this and about vaccines.  I reminded her that Trump took away abortion and he has assaulted so many women, and she said Biden is worse.

I have to stay with her to keep working on the project - it's not negotiable and it's for work.  How do people smooth things over and move on? I don't have to be best friends with her after this (and I'm not) but do you have any ideas for how to love forward without my feeling so angry? Thanks!"

I'm thankful he is no longer in my life actively, don't get me wrong. But im still effected by this immensely, and I haven't been abused in 14 years.

I've always been under the impression that I knew when the abuse started.  I had it vividly in my brain.  I was in kindergarten. But today, out of nowhere, I am having flashes of the abuse starting even younger than i remembered.  I think I was 4ish based on where this happened. It's very distressing. It's not a complete memory and is very fuzzy.. could my brain have made this up?

Self help? Something else?","I have had tried various therapists over my life although I have never really had success. There seems to be a bit of a script I follow.

\*

1.) I talk about the present situation e.g. stress at work, relationship problems etc.

2.) I reveal a big past trauma and I ""work through"" it with them. In reality, speaking about it is not difficult as I intellectualise. The validation feels good, but the progress is always temporary and I am avoiding what I really need to speak about. I think I do this to show they've earned my trust and to feel like I am doing well at therapy.

3.) I get into the childhood stuff, but its just telling the story and getting validation again. I struggle with the ""what next?"" part of it all. ""Reparenting myself"" or ""accepting that my parents couldn't be what I needed and grieving that loss"" is so depressing that it sends me spiralling. I find a lot of it, like inner child work to be... embarrassing? Cheesy? Shameful?. The feeling is so intense that I feel like I'm not actually present and I pretend to engage instead of engaging. I pretend to have feelings I don't, to find value in techniques I don't like, and pretend that they've missed the mark when they've hit it.

4.) I run out of stories to tell. I go back to talking about the day to day things. It gets really repetitive. I start thinking they're bored/angry. I pretend that I'm making progress so I'll be a ""good"" client.

5.) Either:

a.) They realise what I'm doing and call me out. ""You never seem to disagree with me"" etc. Usually I will defend myself vehemently, insisting that they've got it wrong. I start disagreeing with them more in sessions so they'll like me but often I'm pretending to disagree. Within a few sessions, I will suddenly develop a strong dislike for them for seemingly no reason and I will pretend I am better so I can end therapy without dealing with it.

b.) They don't realise what I'm doing and we continue for a while, me spending a huge amount of my income to turn up every week and lie for no reason and then eventually I make an excuse to end it.

\*

I know all of this is really manipulative of me, but I don't want to do it and I can't seem to stop. Every single time I start therapy with the intention of it being different. As I get towards the end of the script, I vow to be more truthful and let them see the ""uglier"" parts of me but in the moment I feel like I can't physically get the words out. I actually think it's a fawn response and I'm struggling to break it.

I have recently read about IFS and it both sounds like the kind of thing that would trigger my embarrassment/shame intensely but also the kind of thing I really like the idea of. I am worried that I will just do the same pattern I always do and it will be a complete waste of money. Therefore, I am also considering whether self-help would be worthwhile. Has anyone tried and was it effective? Is there a kind of therapy I can do on myself that works well for trauma?"

Then there was us at 12 and 11, and we both had more knowledge and I think a lot of stuff similar to what happened to me when I was younger happened to various months and it was just slightly more escalated, penetration didn’t happen but there was one time that I feel like if he didn’t hear someone coming upstairs it would have happened.

Nor do I want to.

I'm in a crisis mode and I don't know how to keep going anymore, or If I even could even If I tried my best.

My girlfriend dumped me (rightfully so) because I did something horrible and betrayed her trust and hurt her.

I don't want to feel sorry for myself, I don't deserve any pity.

I am a completely broken person beyond redemption. I'm too defective to keep living, I don't want to hurt anyone ever again, I don't want to be the cause of someone elses suffering.
But the fact is that I am, I hurt the woman I loved the most.
And I can never forgive myself for it.
She is the sweetest and most loving person I know.

My history is full of trauma, abandonment and mental illnessess.
Atleast before I believed that I was a good person, that has just been wronged and that I was a victim.
Still I wanted to be better, I wanted to be the safety and security for the person who needs it.

And now, I've Hurt and betrayed the one person who loved me.
I can never forgive myself for it, I will always regret what I did to her.

But none of it matters really, I can't undo my actions, I can't repair the damage that I did.

I've always felt that I don't belong in this world, and now I know it's true.

I should've died a long time ago, many times before. But for some reason I survived.
And I regret it.
I should've killed myself successfully long time ago.
At least then I could've died as a good person.
Now it's too late.

I've become everything I tried to be against.
Trauma made my life hell, I've tried my best to be a good person despite all of the things that happened to me.
And I've failed.
I hurt the person I've loved the most, person who trusted me and always cheered me up and supported me.

I'm completely lost and hopeless now, I want to die. I need to die. This world would be better off without me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have nothing left to give.
I don't care anymore at all.
I can't get up, not anymore.

I've tried all of the treatment methods and therapies, there is nothing left for me.
There is no help.

I am broken beyond repair.

It would be better If I just killed myself, at least then I wouldn't Hurt anyone ever again.

My past and trauma and all of the bad things that happened to me, I still clung on to hope that I could survive and things could get better.
Even when I didn't really believe in hope anymore, still I tried my best because I refused to believe that this is all life has to offer to me, that this is all I can do and get.

But now I know, it was true back then and now it's even more true. I can't justify hurting the person I loved the most, and the person who loved me despite all of my flaws.

I don't belong in this world, I should've died a long time ago.
I need to kill myself and remove myself from this world before I hurt anyone else.

I don't want anyone to suffer because of me ever again.

I am broken beyond repair, defective shell of a human. I have nothing left, nothing left to give."

Weed is a medicine. And due to medicines and care being criminalized in our culture, we are left with few that we can self administer without the intervention of a medical provider. Some choose the provider route. I did not.

I chose weed, sugar, and caffeine as my medicinal addictions. Used to be nicotine too, but I've kicked it for now. I tend to cycle them. They do what they do for me, and I don't need to justify my relief to those not inside my skin.

Many people have many comments about the health of my body and frustration with my choices. 

They have a... moral idea. Of me. Because of my choices. 

And I really dont give a shit. The things I do bring no pain to others and I am doing these things as an adult with my full consent and understanding. 

I appreciate the few crumbs of genuine concern under the shit sandwich that is people's ""concern for addiction"" and ""but think of the children"" rhetoric. But I'll speak for most of the potheads here and say - We all pick our poisons.

CPTSD,Divorce after 7years due to my CPTSD,1910gt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1910gt9/divorce_after_7years_due_to_my_cptsd/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Conscious_Try_2436,Conscious_Try_2436,2024-01-07 19:42:02,Divorce after 7years due to my CPTSD,"My condition (before diagnosis) had been used against me for the entire relationship to prove I should allow more abuse for years, until I broke.  After a full mental breakdown 2 years ago I knew my marriage was over. What occured was the worst beyrayal in my eyes. 
However,  I couldn't leave. I was bound by finances and was recovering from a major surgery, that my mother passed from previously. 
I woke up with no friends or family after years of disassociation. I felt like I was living someone else's life. The entire relationship they painted me as the abuser. Easy to do when they trigger you on purpose and you don't even know what's happening.  



I got into therapy and went hard for 2 years still ongoing. I got diagnosed with CPTSD and MDD. 
I have been a shadow and building myself for the first time. I feel like an infant learning to crawl. Now I have no idea where to go from here. I am so afraid of the future.  I have been told my whole relationship I'm too broken to do anything for myself. To the point of not even being able to leave my house alone, and then not at all. 

While I have been hitting my goals and gaining ground, I still live with this person. I still get emotionally abused, and triggered intentionally.  They still tell me how small I am and how I've never done anything. 

Even when I have proof I did these things, I still feel like it didn't happen. I lied like they said. My core keeps telling me of course that's not true. I go to my parts, and they don't trust me. I cry and try to do anything different but I am stuck. I am so frustrated that I can't get out. 

I am so angry at myself for thinking this person loved me. I'm so angry that I gave up so much of my life to them (I've known them for a very long time just not married). 

I feel like I had all this hope in love and life and put it all into one person and now that it didn't work I feel it won't ever work. 

I won't ever tell anyone else I how feel.or about my past. I won't ever be able to confide in someone and be comforted by my partner. I can't risk this again. 

I want it to stop so badly that it's triggered my intrusive ideation.  What if they're right? What if I have absolutely nothing to offer? What if what matters to me never matters to anyone else? 

Can I live alone without society? These thoughts prevent me from being able to actually plan my escape from the situation.  

I wish I had the strength to not be hurt by they're words. I wish so many things, but I can't get anywhere."

Up until then, I was happy. Once I confronted him after having enough evidence, he opened up like a book about all his feelings, thoughts, childhood, everything I wish I had known before. He also confessed he is a pathological liar, although most things he has told me have been true. He feels like he has seperate lives. I feel so so betrayed. My heart aches for everything he has been through to get to this point. I only want him. He was it for me. My best friend. He says he feels so guilty he can’t even handle seeing me again, that he has ruined his life and can never forgive himself for hurting the only person who was so good to him and he didn’t know he could ever do this. He said he realized now he needs help but that he only wants to do it for me and not for himself. I’m so afraid of losing him. I’m also so afraid of losing myself. But I fear that both is already happening. I just want us to get help so bad."

I was watching tik tok before bed and as I was winding down, I came across this motherfucker (hopefully linked below and I’m also sorry to anyone else it may trigger so watch at your own risk: it’s ABOUT the “Still Face Motherhood” experiment but it doesn’t show any of the experiment in the tik tok). It started the trauma memory gate opening…. Not a floodgate thankfully, but a trickle has begun. It was a really long night and I don’t know what to do with myself. I slept a few hours but now I’m just here. I’m already a delayed processor as it is and the crying stopped last night for now. As the woman in the video started talking, and specifically mentioning the Still Face Motherhood experiment, my body already knew before I did. I started getting hot, the tears began at some point, and full sobbing by the end of the video. I’ve tried watching the “Still Face” experiment before and don’t remember if I couldn’t finish the video or if I just couldn’t watch when the mom does the “Still Face”. Either way, I watched it and a video about it right after and couldn’t watch the mom do the “Still Face” either time. Even just thinking about it now makes me so viscerally uncomfortable. I wanna make it clear it’s not just a neutral face sometimes, but a “Still Face” repeatedly when the child is trying to connect or get their needs met. The memories that started coming brought me to the realization that me and my brother were probably bullied by my family for being neurodivergent and my brother was just unable to mask his well enough. Me on the other hand masked so hard I burned out spectacularly at 20 and things only got worse from there with my family. When I say probably it’s because I’ve had suspicions of my neurodivergence since starting therapy while my brother is more “obviously” autistic. Like, it’s a fucked up 50/50 of am I actually neurodivergent in some way or are my similar traits “just” from the trauma of being an unwanted child, especially only a little over a year younger than a child who needed more care. My brother, on the other hand, was diagnosed with just ADHD before autism was more understood as a kid and diagnosed both later in life. I asked my mom once if my brother knew he’d been diagnosed with autism later and she just… never responded. I now get to wonder if that silence was for me, too. I was so well trained to be passive that I just let her not respond and left the room. I owe my brother an apology for the rest of my lifetime at least. I fell in line and withdrew while he got the brunt of it. My oldest sister was always the worst bitch/bully about tearing us both down for literally any and all differences or mistakes. I was already worried she was traumatizing her kids thru the generational trauma my family already has but she does the “still face,” to them, too. It’s such a weird place to be in because I know it wasn’t done intentionally to traumatize me… but at the same time I know I’ve been treated my whole life like I’m a nuisance and like they’re apathetic about my existence at BEST period. And by they I wanna make it clear I mean them all, especially my sister and mom, while my brother is excluded in that. He’s always been the better person, forever the best of us. Showing us all far more love than any of us deserves from him. I remember specifically learning that whatever behavior the family deemed as odd or bad should be treated with criticism at best and bullying at worst. Being the youngest, I couldn’t figure out why my older brother didn’t understand this dynamic and just mask harder or better like I did as if that was the correct response to abuse. If I owe my brother a lifetime apology, they owe him one for eternity. Only time they seemed to want me around is when I’d fulfill a role for them or in the family. Wanna know a “fun” realization?? I’m doing a lot of therapy rn and have been curious why I sometimes/often exaggerate my facial expressions… in my head the emotional reason was always “I never want anyone to feel how I’ve felt.” I DIDNT KNOW HOW LITERAL THAT WAS UNTIL LAST NIGHT. I may call an extra therapy session we’ll see. Take care of yourselves everyone. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT84XKJ6X/"

I barely remember anything from my childhood except the bad things or sprinkles of random images that pop up in my head. I can’t remember things about myself either. If someone asks me randomly whats my favorite snack or movie, my mind will literally go blank. This has also discouraged me to go on dates or meet new people because if they ask me questions about myself I literally can’t remember which makes me look idiotic. 

To make matters worse I also have ADHD which also contributes to my poor working memory. But everyone else I know with adhd are still able to have flowing conversations and tell stories. My brothers grew up in the same household as me and they always recall all our childhood which confuses me because why did I get the memory issues related to trauma and not them? 

I have issues remembering what happens in Anime, books, YouTube videos, etc. It’s been hell for me especially socially. I can’t remember anything I did or anything good I can bring up in conversations so my conversations with people can be very surface level. 

I may be wrong but I feel like it impacts my self development journey as well. If i do research on topics like goal setting or self confidence and I can’t remember what i learned then how am i going to apply it to my life? 

I was thinking about writing notes and making flashcards of thing i want to remember. Correct me if im wrong but if im having issues remembering things, then i have to do the extra work to store things into my long term memory through active recall or regularly reviewing notes about my life. Obviously the goal is to go to therapy to adress my trauma in depth but it’s not something i can afford right now.

Please share your advice and coping strategies for this issues, thank you!"

I feel it's like you want to find someone who is further on in their recovery, who can sit with pain, who understand but also has some capacity to give. And I guess that's kind of what a good therapist is meant to do, but I find I'm looking for someone to relate to, someone who can share their own story and relate, empathise at the hard parts, laugh at funny bits, hold you when you need comfort, validate you. I think there is a big bit missing in typical therapy that the therapist does not share themselves and all these professional boundaries are in place, which limit love and connection which are elixirs.

 At the moment I don't really have anyone in my life who is in touch with their feelings and is doing the work of healing. I have those I can talk and relate to about the struggles but they haven't yet started doing the work of soothing and releasing their pain and they tend to want to stay home a lot and they tend to be very tired and it's hard to find many opportunities to socialise with them. I also have low energy a lot of days whilst doing healing work but there are days when I do want to socialise. Then I have people in my life who are always up for doing stuff but I feel disconnected being around them whilst healing as they are unable to be in touch with their own sadness or pain and so I can only be around them when those aren't my predominate feelings. Otherwise when I do bring up my sadness and pain it tends to feel kinda awkward or they mean well but tend to say invalidating things, like trying to show why I don't need to be sad.

And this is the big thing I've realised is that whilst you uncover all this stuff about yourself, all these things get uncovered about the people in your life. So as I get more comfortable exploring and expressing my sadness, I've learnt what the people in my life's relationship is to sadness. Or to vulnerability, intimacy, fear, anger.

And so when I express when I feel invalidated to them I realise it's actually a huge topic, because it's not just how the person is being with you in the moment, it's how they are operating in life. In general if they can't sit with your pain, they cannot sit with their pain and the avoidance of their pain is what is allowing them to continue in life. It's helped me feel more compassionate to these people who won't get in touch with their feelings (and meaning I end up feeling invalidated and disconnected to them - feeling like an abandonment/rejection) as when I finally lifted the lid of that pandora's box of my pain, I wasn't able to work anymore.

So it's like I desperately wanted them to join me in being in touch with our feelings but it's also rough as hell right now, so when I look at what it is that I'm actually asking them to be able to do, it's a huge thing.

It teaches to embrace these flaws as part of the history of an object.  Once repaired, it is useable and functional again.

But then as an adult I started remembering, and it just feels like such a cruel thing to do to young kids. 

My parent would be triggered by something we did (definitely they should’ve never had kids lol), something that’s normal for kids to do like slight misbehaving or playing too loud or whatever. 
My parent would go for days without talking to us. When they were in the same room as us or passed by us in a hallway, they wouldn’t look us in the eye. If we looked at them and apologized or tried to start a lighthearted conversation to get the parent to acknowledge us, they would look straight past us like we weren’t there. If we kept speaking, they would say “Do you hear something? That’s weird I thought I heard something” and would just continue doing what they were doing, without looking or acknowledging us. 

What do you think about it?? How traumatic is it? Have you experienced it?"

I've made a few posts here about repressed memories and recovering those and my reasoning as to why I believe I have repressed memories to begin with, which has only gotten deeper.

I happen to have seizures and am on anticonvulsants and I know there are several papers on epileptic seizures basically rewiring parts of your brain and bringing back repressed memories. I have a paper on seizures bringing back vivid recollections of traumatic memories, which has happened before. The month of December was pretty rough personally and with my partner and I ended up having a ton of seizures that generalized and I'm pretty sure that's what sent me into the worst PTSD relapse I've ever had that's still going. The beginning of the month started off with a bunch of nightmares fir a few weeks, then we had all the personal problems for a few weeks, then the rest of the month was just hell.

I realized upon further thought that I do hallucinate to a lesser degree (such as thinking someone is walking up behind me), but the only other time I've hallucinated to this extent was temporarily after a suicide attempt when I overdosed. It wasn't constant, but just enough to unsettle me.

It started off with me seeing a shadowy figure on my porch that I knew wasn't real. Now I feel like I'm always seeing or hearing things that aren't there, like those figures, I looked back in a vent post I had made elsewhere and apparently I had an olfactory hallucination before, I've had auditory ones where I think people are calling my name, specifically I'll think I'm hearing my abuser's voice. I've been having flashbacks to hell that I can, in fact, verify happened, but I'll dissociate during the flashback and shut down and go nonverbal because I'm either too disturbed by the content or afraid I'll be judged, so unless I write down what the flashback is, I will forget what the recollection was, which is also what happened before when I mentioned I've had recollections from seizures. However, I've also been having my first tactile hallucinations (sexual in nature and massive trigger warning if you don't want to know what it was) >!where I felt an erect penis being violently rubbed and twisted all over my arm while I was just minding my business scrolling on my phone!< that I cannot verify the existence of so I can't really say whether or not it was a flashback or not, even though I dissociated in the same exact way as I would a flashback. I also had another, particularly disturbing experience yesterday that I'm not sure was a delusion, a hallucination, or an intrusive thought that I just grabbed and thought was real >!where my husband was trying to initiate sex and began to use a vibrator, and the nerve pain I experience, coupled with the vibration and the feeling of my skin sticking to it made me think he was using a saw blade to cut off my clitoris. On one hand, I knew the thought was irrational and he didn't have a saw blade in his hand, but on the other hand, I couldn't shake the thought and began to panic and dissociate, again, in the same way.!< I again cannot verify that anything of this sort has ever happened to me, so I can't say it was a flashback, however, if it turns out to be real, it would definitely explain a whole lot of things, including even some of the self harm urges I would get.

Honestly, I'm just terrified, especially with the sexual stuff invading my wakefulness now, because it was just restricted to specific types of nightmares >!(I would exclusively get nightmares about being raped, sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked, however I don't really have any suspicions about being trafficked, which is why I'm wondering why I even have those nightmares and now these delusions or whatever they are)!<. I feel like I'm crazy, especially because I'm starting to straight up hallucinate now and everything is just bad. My abuser also has delusions that are uncontrolled and will use them to stalk me and cause harm and I am scared that I am turning into my abuser, but with the mental illness part, not necessarily by collecting toxic behaviors, but because of a mental illness. Everything about a CPTSD relapse is terrifying for me, but now since we're adding more jazz to it, I don't know if it's just plain CPTSD anymore and it's scary and it adds stigma and it makes me want to hide or eliminate myself and I'm scared I'm just going to get worse or become toxic or abusive or my abuser. I can't trust my brain anymore because I know it's playing tricks on me every day, whether it's the epilepsy or the alice in wonderland syndrome or maybe a migraine aura or a good ol mental health episode that you pull out of a hat because I never know what I'm going to get at this point. 

I noticed that it seems like I'll hallucinate or have a flashback or something within a few hours of having a generalized seizure, which is why I'm pretty positive it's connected to them, and I don't think my meds are doing a good job controlling them since I'm on the lowest dosage and my neuro is more intent to cross me off his patient list instead of putting in the time to adjust my meds and such. This could also be a side effect to the meds, or maybe it could be repressed memories trying to surface, and if that's actually what this is, I'm fucking terrified to know the rest, because I know a child wasn't designed to handle the stress of whatever that was happening, but if that's real, neither is an adult. No normal adult could just deal with that shit, and to be honest, any of the abuse in general that we've had to put up with as kids or whatever."

However I have no memories of anything happening, in fact I have a huge memory gap during that age specifically. 

My main symptoms began showing at around 4-5 years old. Any mention, or image of anything related to the human body from the inside (be it a video of a cell flowing through blood, for example, or a close up of the inside of the human stomach, etc.) suscitated a reaction in me which I can only explain as panic, chills, and fear (more specifically, any representation of something entering the human body made me feel this way). When I had my first sex ed. class at 11 I began reacting the same way when hearing about the topic, which I then discovered that to be my trigger. 

I also remember isolating a lot at the age of 4, I wouldn't enter the classroom and sit in silence in the floor for hours, multiple times.

Any explicit talk about sex, or porn itself, caused the same reaction in me, so I kind of suppressed anything sex related for most of my teenage years. However, being a handsome young male I couldn't pretend forever, and eventually ended up in multiple situations where sex was involved.

I didn't enjoy them, felt kind of numb and could never get to penetrating properly. 

Eventually, I got really close with someone and we both liked each other, until one day we ended in the same bed together and she got on top of me very suddenly and wanted to have sex. Something flicked in my brain, kind of triggered a fight or flight response and immediatelly began crying rivers, out of nowhere. She held me in her arms while I curled up and cried. She really cared about me, and that was a very beautiful moment, despite it all.

That relationship never got anywhere. I don't feel safe with people touching me if I don't trust them 100%. Any relationship I've tried to have ends up in nothing because of my refusal to have sex right away. It feels like no one wants to take that burden.

To anyone in a similar situation, what have you done to be able to carry on, and live life? Have you found any partner willing to take up that responsibility and be patient?"

Looking for support and kind words,"*TW: mention of self-harm, suicidal thoughts*

I just got back from a high school friend’s engagement party. I am triggered, in pain, experiencing emotional flashbacks and can’t figure out how to make it all stop 😭

I grew up queer in a conservative society and never got to experience dating or relationships as a teenager. I was always the single one, always without a partner, always being the odd one out. And I made me feel like shit. There was this overhwelming feeling of rejection, like no one wants me, like I don’t deserve love or partnership.

I did manage to start dating in my mid 20s but haven’t been able to find a stable long-term relationship in the past 10 years or so. It’s been a mix of casual hookups, or being cheated on by a partner, or being in a toxic relationship, or else being someone’s “backup option” and getting dumped as soon as they found someone better.

It all makes me feel lilke a piece of shit. I start thinking “Why else would I be the only single one when everyone else manages to find a partner? There must be something wrong with me.” And these thoughts come with this pain which is a mix of rejection, my own inadequacy and a sense that “no one wants me”. Rationally, I know that this is not true but it’s impossible to believe anything else!

The worst part is that I used to feel all this very intensely when I was around 17-19, to the extent that I was seriously contemplating suicide. Although I ended up not attempting, being triggered to that time brings back those suicidal thoughts and even thoughts of self-harm. Thankfully, I can’t find any sharp objects around me, so it looks like I won’t be self-harming too seriously (beyond maybe scratching myself or something).

I’m tired of fighting these thoughts and all the negative emotions. I just want this pain and mental chaos to stop 😞

I have two kids, age 12 & 8 (who are both on the internet, and probably here it all the time), and I explained to them that it is a scientific term in relation to a specific condition - and really shouldn't be used outside of it, as it diminishes the actual meaning. And this is detrimental to other people's understanding of just how serious and troubling it is to have real triggers.

I do believe most people have trauma, probably multiple, and thus in could be an actual trigger for some people, so I don't wanna jump to conclusions. It's just that it gets used for a minor irritation way too often, it seems."

I got engaged to my love in October, i’m employed, I have friends who care about me, i’m relatively healthy, i have a dog that i love, and a nice place to live. i can take care of myself and meet my basic needs, and then some. i have come a long way from the emotionally abusive home that i knew and am working hard on LC/NC. 

I started EMDR therapy at the end of September and am so happy with my therapist. She is the best i’ve ever had and i feel very safe with her. we are still working on the reprocessing memory portion of EMDR and haven’t necessarily gotten to the stage of EMDR where you bring out the big guns and it starts to “work”, which is when everyone begins to rave about its effects. 

since we are at the reprocessing stage, i feel like i’ve been spiraling down a deep depression hole, which i guess is to be expected when you are rehashing old painful memories that you have repressed for years. i just didn’t really expect for these memories to be bleeding into my current experiences and my current reality, and i’m having somewhat of a difficult time distinguishing between the two. has anyone else experienced this with EMDR or in general? i feel so overwhelmed every day and can’t stop crying, i just feel very lost and confused. 

a major disruptive family event happened a couple months ago that has been new-ish and there are new wounds, that also have brought up the old ones. then, last month i got COVID for the first time and fell into an even deeper depression and isolation. and now im worried that i can’t pull myself out of it and am losing my sense of self. i have been more irritable and “splitting” (i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd but i recognize this symptom in myself) and yeah it’s a lot. 

i just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this at the beginning of EMDR because i want to hear your experiences. my SO is extremely concerned but understanding, and i just feel so much shame (what im trying NOT to feel) for putting them through my bullshit. thanks everyone <3"

I just wanted to share what I’m going through tonight and in general as I don’t know what else to do and I am currently very anxious. I’m 30, I am the only sibling out of 4 to still live with parents. Still at 30 when my parents fight I freeze, I was standing completely still for 2 hours listening in case I need to jump in as some times it gets physical and my dad is a lot stronger then my mum. Nothing physical happened in the end, but at some point it felt like it was so angry he wanted to lash out on her. 

I know this is somehow linked to why my life has been challenging so far and I’ve really struggled with relationships, anxiety,  depression, careers, health, wealth, you name it. Recently I’ve been trying to be more accountable in accepting it is half my fault for not being resilient enough and things have been somewhat trending upward the last few weeks and I’m really scared this is going to derail me again.

They have lots of silly fights, small bickering or ignore each other frequently. but today was a level 3 out of 5 event (events  is just at a way for me to define how it differs from everyday stuff or outside the realm of normal in this house). 
The first event I ever remember witnessing was when I was 5-7 maybe, I remember hearing the commotion from the kitchen and my older siblings trying to distract us until at some point we all ended up in the kitchen because it must have gotten really bad. I have a very vivid memory in my head of me and my 3 siblings standing in the kitchen all mortified and crying, with my dad siting on my mum with her hands pinned and blood on her face. The only other thing I  remember that night was that shortly after, my mother’s parents came, and then police as well. I also remember my dad apologising and being very sorry when the police were around. (That would be level 5 event)

There were multiple level 3-4 that I can’t quite remember or define individually over the years. 
I’d say there have been 5 level 5 events over the years. Police called multiple times. On multiple occasions as early as 15 I have had to jump in between them sometimes when punches or slaps were thrown. On 1 occasion after seeing my dad hit mum as hard as he could 2-3 times with a yellow pages I remember him pursuing us in car pursuit, my sisters was driving and I remember him screaming at us through the window whenever he got close. 
A few years ago I remember him getting drunk and had a massive fight, I guess he wanted to escape or leave his life/situation, he stripped all his clothes off and walked down our street in a fit of rage, luckily I was able to get him back inside quickly. 
Sometimes I have to comfort him when he’s emotional and drunk after a fight, it’s really difficult to comfort someone you’re also afraid of.

My father is mentally unwell, and I know a few reasons why. Although he is the scary one to see angry, my mother is not all innocent. She’s isn’t perfect, or the most mentally balanced person either. But in terms of the actually arguments, she is probably equally as childish as him sometimes. 

I was quite depressed over the last few years, it’s a vicious cycle going in and out of depression, sometimes it lasts days, sometimes a few weeks. 

Im terrified that this will always affect me, I feel I can’t leave my mother alone with my father knowing how he can react over something so small and silly (obviously in his mind it’s rather large with a complex mean, but it’s very irrational and when he can’t control things he gets angry). Apart of me feels like I should completely disconnect from my parents and maybe even my siblings, for a real fresh start. because it really breaks me to know they will never truly be happy. It makes me sad to see how much of a broken and twisted man my father is, and my mother is not perfect but she’s very kind. Although they are fighting about something different it always has the same themes, as if they have had the same fight for 38 years a some small thing flares it up.

I feel as though my anxious thoughts are always here, right now they are loud and very apparent. But I feel like they are always with me lingering in the back of my head. Not know when the next event will occur or how bad it’s going to be. Sometimes I hear things, on one occasion maybe a year ago I recall standing dead still in my room for an hour not knowing if or what my parents were fighting about. They weren’t even fighting and I think the neighbours were having a party or something. 

This felt good to write down, but even now that I’ve finished  my head is slowly drifting back into hyper awareness, any subtle sound of the dead night is mistaken for whispering or fighting. Every creek in my house could be my dad getting out of bed to fight some more. I can’t move. 

I apologies for my post being so jumbled and non linear. I really just wanted to write down what I’m feeling or thinking in the moment."

i grew up fearing strangers, teenagers, adults, anyone in position of power of me, anyone who could control me. i both want to fawn and please them and run away in terror. to shun them as i feel shunned. it won't go away i don't know how to cope with it. i only feel somewhat safe around maternal woman at my work which is a double edged sword considering i was abused by both men and women. 

i got triggered because i brought up a creative concept over a dnd campaign in the presence of an adult (who runs the campaign) who shut it down immediately. this adult is often dismissive or takes things very literally and seriously. this triggers me but i try to control it because they are a mutual friend. logical side of me thinks it's no big deal, it was just an idea i probably wouldn't have gone through with anyway, and they are the DM so it makes sense. irrational side of me got angry, wanted to be self-destructive, felt dissociative and distractible at work. if they were the same age as me i think i wouldn't have been so intimidated, but they are 5 almost 6 years older than me. i felt hurt and dejected.

I've been in  therapy for around 2 years now.

I don't want to enter in a lot of detail but my trauma is mainly related to my ex partner and porn. He treated me like shit and disregarded lots of my boundaries. Apart from this I have always felt not enough due to my childhood.

These all leads to the present where my hypervigilance activates when my partner is in another room for a ""long"" period of time. My fear is that be is going to masturbate/watch porn.

I don't like the idea of porn but I completely understand that masturbation is healthy and good for him and the relationship. I have nothing against it. I know all the theory but I cannot help but feeling like shit every time he goes to the bathroom for a long time or when he is playing in another room.

I've done EMDR, parts therapy etc I've tried deep breathing to calm myself. The only thing that helps more is wearing my noise cancelling headphones in the situations. I've realised that I'm mostly scared of hearing him doing something. If I'm in silence I'm way better.

When he goes to the bathroom I cannot help but getting hypervigilant, trying to hear everything, nit being able to focus on anything else. My heart goes fast.

My therapist says that that's a way of ""running away"" from the situation and I get it... She told me about maybe telling him to do it on purpose while I'm in another room so my body understands nothing happens. Understand that I'm safe and I have the tools to overcome it.

I know I won't die but at the same time I feel like even like that I would still feel like shit. I know it's a long process but I'm so tired...

Im so tired of not feeling safe in my own house, of thinking about this fucking trauma every day, several times.

He went for holidays this Christmas and I was dreading him to return home because of this. Poor thing, I feel so bad for feeling that but I understand that my body just needed a break.

I love him and I know this has nothing to do with him but I'm so tired... I would give all my money for a normal life.

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit. Any advice is welcome."

It’s like the lights and volume in my life are too low.,"I have read articles about how dissociative amnesia isn’t permanent, that it’s treatable, but I haven’t seen any sort of testimonials or studies following these patients. It seems unbelievable at times. Maybe I need to dig in more. I was curious about any experiences navigating this condition and the disconnected nature because of CPTSD

I have had a sort of fog following me around starting from a blacked out period between the ages of 7 and 8. I’ve been out of it and inattentive ever since. I struggle forming memories, recalling memories, and feeling sort of “space-y” most of my life.  Recognizing myself in the mirror is challenging and I can’t be present with my loved ones. It has created a distance between myself and others I don’t know how to close. 

I honestly see no true hope of achieving relief from this condition. My therapist has said that I can have a fulfilling life once I install safety and consistency in my life that will be enough to support the processing of trauma.

I struggle with dissociation, but not sure if it is DID. I recently did 12 sessions of EMDR over the span of 3 months, and I am incredibly destabilised. I constantly get flashbacks to this one particular traumatic event, and cannot do any type of work or relax and enjoy myself. All I can do is sit on Tiktok and hope to distract myself. I am unable to ground myself, I tried a technique such as focusing on my breath and focusing on my feet on the ground, but because I have ADHD I really struggle to focus. My go to mechanism of dealing with it is daydreaming, which is how I got through it at a child, but I want to stop that now. Any advice?"

Hello,

 I'm seeking insights regarding a potential trauma-linked issue. In kindergarten, I witnessed an incident where an overweight teacher sat on a child, an event that seems to have shaped my sexual development. This led to a fetish about being physically overpowered by larger individuals, further intensified by a pornography addiction and a shift towards content involving male individuals. I've actively engaged in behaviors and fantasies tied to this fetish, causing significant distress. I'm concerned this might be trauma-induced. Can this be linked to that early experience, and is it possible for me to have a normal, healthy relationship despite this? I would appreciate guidance on how to understand and address these issues."

[disclaimer: I actually had zero memories of this up until 3 hours ago. I found all of this info on social media and still don’t know if actually did one these things. I have little to no memories at all of these incidents.]


Okay. I know the title sounds fucken awful, because it is. I’m a recovered abuser. I am a case of the abused becomes the abuser. When I was 13-14 I was a violent and scared child. I was being severely abused in several ways and had been since infancy. I grew up thinking love was pain and misery, and that I was creature meant to be used sexually. 

I then hurt a person, who we’ll call W. I was 13 when we first started dating. I was mean and violent at times. I once stabbed them with my house key because they had said a triggering phrase and had provoked me do so. This had left simply a scrape, but that doesn’t really matter.

I used this poor boy as a therapist, dumping all of my tales of abuse on him and sobbing in his arms on multiple occasions. I confined in him about my abuse and at times put pressure on him to help save me. Which never happened of course. He had no means of saving me without possibly being killed by my abuser. 

This is the part I have no memory about. He accused me of sexually assaulting him. I have no memory of this at all, I have no memories of ever being intimate with him at all. Though I honestly don’t doubt this claim. I was being heavily sexually abused by several men at this time and thought of my only life purpose as being an object to be used. I can bet one day I tried to get him to reenact the abuse so that I could feel like my purpose was being fulfilled.

Now i’m almost 19 and I feel like a monster. I only ever had memories of him hurting me, but I didn’t know I had hurt him first. I feel fucken awful. I know i’m not that hurt kid anymore, but I can’t help but be extremely disgusted by my past actions. I have gone through intense therapy to recover from everything, but I swear remembering all of this has set me back. I feel just horrible. How could I do that to a person? After everything i’ve been through I turned around and repeated the same abuse I was facing at home. It may have not been anywhere as extreme, but still. I still did those things. I hurt a person. 

I know that psychology would likely explain younger me actions, but I know that it doesn’t matter. I know that my abuse isn’t an excuse. I don’t quite know what to do with these memories. I’m not the same person anymore. I’ve been in a healthy relationship for over a year now, i’ve kindled lovely friendships and i’ve been forgiven by who younger me did wrong. But for W his case was the worst. No one else had I abused. I will never be able to apologize to him. It would be selfish for me to msg him and try to apologize. I don’t know what to do now. I know I need to talk to my therapist about this and possibly go into intensive care again to try and be better."

If you do something else that works, please leave a comment of what it is. Best wishes to all of you. 

I have a smart light that I use for a night light. It is 100% customizable to my needs. It's very soothing to not be in a room totally dark. It's in a lamp beside my bed. This has provided a lot of relief.  
  
I sleep with my dog, I know no one is in the house because he is sleeping. If a pet is a no go, try a stuffed animal, it may help. If a stuffed animal is not an option, place a pillow against your back to simulate safe contact if that is not triggering for you.   
  
Fragrance, I wear a soothing cologne to bed, it sounds ridiculous but it helps me stay grounded. If you don't want to do that, find a room fragrance that makes you think of happy thoughts and to relax, baking spices, vanilla, anything you like.  
  
If you have something in your room potentially triggering, get rid of it. A jacket hanging on a hook would freak me out because it looked like someone was in my room. There is nothing hanging, nothing by the door, etc. in my room. I sleep with a loud fan and my bedroom door open.   
  
Try a cooler room. Cooler temperatures help us sleep better.

Some people swear by a weighted blanket.   
  
Sleep hygiene, super important. Leave your cell phone somewhere else, turn off electronics 30 minutes before bed, anything stimulating try to limit including reading. I have tried meditation with mixed results. I usually just lay in bed and do relaxation techniques until I fall asleep.   
  
On bad nights I say to hell with it and I just get out of bed and do something totally mindless that is not stimulating. like sit on the couch and count things, do grounding technique etc. Way better than laying there thinking what if, or I don't deserve whatever.  


I had really good results with nightmare protocols. [https://embracechangetherapy.com/2021/09/29/the-nightmare-protocol/](https://embracechangetherapy.com/2021/09/29/the-nightmare-protocol/)

I want to have friends and do fun stuff with people, but I just - don't trust anyone. every single person in my life has abused me in some way - and it's so hard to believe that there are real life people out there who aren't out to be mean to me.   


its just - there are so many limitations that my brain is putting on me - and it's infuriating. the things that I used to be able to do I now can't: i cant go grocery shopping, i cant go for walks, a lot of the time I can't even leave my bedroom. i cant even really have sex today - and get this, I want a human to degrade me and make me feel like the worst person on the planet and or do borderline unethical things to me - and i dont understand why.   


im just frozen, all the time. i dont know. its so hard to believe that I have to be alive for the next 50 years. i dont know. does it get better? i want to have hope. "

Anytime I feel a negative emotion, I gaslight myself by saying I’m crazy or overreacting. I genuinely do not know if my feelings are justified. 

I am currently in a relationship (almost year and a half) and the only arguments with my partner are about the same issue - his female coworker and my uncomfortably with their relationship. It is to the point that I’m ready to leave the relationship. I feel I am too sick and he does not deserve to deal with me, that I am just too much but I don’t know. Am I really the one who is blowing it out of proportion or is he just not respecting me? 

I hate being this person. I hate not knowing real from my imagination. I hate not trusting anyone around me. I hate my brain. I just want an off switch. No medication is helping. I am beyond numb. Therapy is so expensive. I want to be cured, saved, fixed or something. I don’t want to keep operating like this. I can’t. I’m exhausted."

I was prescribed Prazosin for it but I’m bad at taking it & it sometimes just doesn’t work for some reason. The thing is that my nightmares are never related to anything that’s actually happened to me. They’re always random stressful scenarios like stepping in glass or missing a final, occasionally something more intense like a person dying but the situation is always completely absurd & full of dream logic. I wake up briefly after they end, fall back asleep, maybe have another nightmare like this, and every morning I’m sweaty & have damp clothes. I can’t find things online about this since usually the information about recurring nightmares in a PTSD context is about reliving traumatic events. Has anyone had something similar happen/found a way to manage it?"

I realized that this is triggered because the artist creating the media is taking up space in some regard (e.g. a musical artist sings loudly/unconventionally, someone is dancing confidently online, etc.). I think it stems from 1. Shame about taking up space and feeling like I can’t and 2. Shame about my personal taste/interests. To combat this, I’ve been listening to a lot of the music that made me feel uneasy and finding joy in it through dancing to it. I’ve been watching people be loud and joyful in YouTube videos/videos on social media. This may seem silly or a strange place to derive shame from, but this was an interesting realization for me and I’m proud of taking up more space than I’m used to."

Pretty sure I don't have one though.

But from time to time, I will think ""wait, someone's in my room because I see something that I identify as a person's silhouettes. When I turn, they are gone, sometimes I see why I saw a silhouette (i.e. because a bush lookes really ""person-like""), sometimes I do not. Yet, I have the feeling that this is not normal. To be honest, it scares me quite a bit.

I might have the same thing for noises. Like gaming at 4 in the morning and thinking ""there's someone in the hallway"". I feel myself tensing up, I take off my headset, and I listen - and then there's nothing.

Why? This is kind of scaring me. Is that a traume response, some sort of hypervigilance? Or is this something else?

No matter how hard I ""tried"" to be different, I picked up many ways of relating to the world from my abusers (ie, my family of origin). 

Left untreated, my emotional dysregulation, inability to self-sooth, hyper sensitivity to criticism,  mental fragmentation, numbing, narcissism, and addictions would inevitably perpetuate the cycle of abuse as a significant other or parent. 

My wife is not my surrogate mother who I subconsciously expect to be perfectly attuned to me. 

The world is not responsible for tiptoeing around my triggers.

I interpret many perfectly neutral interactions to be critical or negative. 

As a full grown adult, I have an ability to set healthy boundaries, to take care of myself, and to accept myself lovingly that I am abdicating to others. 

The way through these issues is not control, isolation, or self harm. It is through self awareness and taking responsibility to slowly learn what I should have as a child through reparenting myself. 

It isn't easy, pleasant, or fast, but these lessons have already saved my marriage and in many ways, myself.

I was very anxious especially when my closest friend, whose place we were gathering at, gave me a huge hug and a loud yell in my ears. I'm sure they could tell my nervousness with a lot of questions and talking as I walked in. I calmed down after awhile and got situated. Night goes on and things seem to settle down, I make my rounds having decent conversations with everyone. 

I did kind of vent about my family and a friend but I didn't see it as such since it was more of a funny if dark story. After it gets mentioned I move to the table where it was all females until I took a seat. The woman who I am/was the closest to was joking about naming her kids after me and mentioning about some guy hitting on her and making out. I didn't think much of it at the time but later on I started noticing more direct flirting, getting close, light touches, bring me into conversations.

Well eventually she gets a little too tipsy and we all start to leave so she can go to bed. I message her the next day just seeing how she was and letting her know I appreciated seeing all of them. She mentions how her life is in a bit of phase but nothing detailed or serious. I let her know about my condition and what not and she really seems to be understanding. I invite her out that weekend again with another mutual friend of course but she is busy. I understand as it was the day of when I asked and told her I look foward to our ""late friendsgiving"". Eventually I try to lighten the mood in our chats for the next couple days. But I began to have flashbacks to how it used to be, that caring demeanor she had for me and still seems to have for me. I try to flirt back over text and she seems to enjoy it until I make a joke about how ""our daughter(s)"" would act. 

There is no response,so no big deal. Figure it didn't land, I then text if she would like to go to a comedy show for next month. No response and I assume she is ignoring the message which is fine but has raised my anxiety to a whole other level as I try to restain myself from messaging her again. I haven't but now I feel like I have reconnected and made things awkward. I am waiting to see if she gives me a more formal invite to friendsgiving since she never verified the date and time yet. I know I'll be all right no matter what happens and this seems pretty light comapred to what I have read in here. Just needed to vent it out as I feel I have wasted all other eyes and ears. I am fortunate to have an already solid group of people from different areas of my life. I just worry I'll wear them out as well.

A father who leaves his children behind and never comes back? Or a father who's present but absent; physically present, but absent as an equal to his wife and protector of the children.  
When it comes to recovery from Complex PTSD, or grief, or really any condition, it's never a good idea to compare whose plight is better or worse.  
Recovery is personal.  
Your pain is not the same as mine.  
You process grief at the loss of a loved one differently than I do.  
We each have our own recovery.  
When it comes to my Father, he was a good, kind man.  
He was the youngest child in his family, raised by a cold woman alone after her husband died.  
No affection, no humor, no sunshine.  
Knowing my father the way I knew him...a good, kind, warm man...it had to have been hard on him as a child to not know the love or affection of a mother.  
Always cold and lacking of warmth. And there was no nurturing.  
As the youngest, he modeled himself after other boys.  
If they drank, he drank.  
If they went to the Army, he went to the Army.  
My Mom married a man who was clearly unfinished business.  
She helped him become a man and father. She helped him become spiritual.  
She helped him express himself appropriately in front of the kids.  
But he was still human and unfinished.  
At a time when men worked long hours, did the physical labor, came home, had a drink and a meal and went to bed.  
He was present, for sure, in the big picture.  
But absent when it came to protecting his boy from predators.  
My sexual abuse, on the surface, could have been avoided if my Mom didn't have a case of ""hero worship"" when it came to Catholic priests.  
She's the one that made it happen - she invited the predator into the house.  
She encouraged me to go with him.  
She made it happen.  
She lit the match.  
She put the fox in the henhouse.  
And that's why it's easy to blame her for everything.  
Her personality and mental illness and tendency to belittle her children didn't help garner sympathy.  
It's understandable if no one came to her defense.  
In my family, she was the bad cop. My Dad the good cop.  
And that's where the irony kicks in.  
My Dad WAS a policeman. Sworn to serve and protect.  
Yet where was he when the fox was led into the henhouse by my Mom?  
Where was he when he could have stepped in to question allowing a family friend to take me on a trip unsupervised?  
He could have stopped it all.  
He could have put my Mom in her place, or at least taken an equal interest in deciding whether I should go on a trip alone with an adult long-ago family friend 500 miles from home.  
He could have said ""the boy is not going on that trip"".  
But he didn't.  
And that's the hole the predator crawls through to capture its prey.  
Sexual predators find the weak link in the chain and exploit it.  
The boy on the outside of the cool kids group on the playground.  
The boy with the absentee father.  
The boy who desperately seeks a male role model or father figure  
Or, in my case, knowing the hard-working, kind father of mine deferred to my overbearing Mom who made all the calls and decisions when it came to who I could be left unsupervised with.  
The predator is always looking for the opening.  
And that's where my Dad failed.  
He was present in my life for sure.  
But when it came to protecting me from the predator, he was absent.  
Rest in Peace Dad. I forgive you and I love you."

No one really cared and now I’m in my mid 20s","Idk I have a lot of grief right now in terms of feeling betrayed and disappointed. I had to put so much energy into climbing out of my trainwreck childhood and escaping abuse.

I see people I went to school with who were much luckier and sometimes not necessarily that (I really don’t mean this in a bad way) smart or passionate or interested. They’re sort of just blissfully unaware and went after stability from a place of stability and got it. 

I’m struggling always in poverty etc. Yes I’m making progress, but because my childhood was so full of pain, I’ve made it my mission to actually follow my dream. It’s not an easy dream but it’s doable if you work hard and you’re the one of the best. 

The entire reason I’m still pursuing this dream is because I know I will be  alone, no one is coming to save me ever, and I feel that I shouldn’t have to give up on the thing I love the most (and always loved) because my parents were deranged and envious and tried to destroy me. But also, I’m sadly not as sharp as I was 10 years ago. All of the traumas and isolation finally got to me, and about four or five years ago I realised I was never getting past the psychometric pre-interview tests for certain jobs and internships that I had been on track to do. This was extra motivation for me to leave behind the stable path (law) and go after what I really wanted. 

But it’s hard, nearly impossible with all of the extra bs I have to go through. And I’m broke, it started when my parents basically forced me into debt when I was 18. I feel like I never stood a chance in some ways. 

I’m making progress but all of this requires a transformation for myself, if I want to be successful at what I’m doing. I’m completely alone, I have no history (no record or proof of what happened to me), no savings, no support.

I guess the main issue right now is that is triggering me is the way I’ve just been stuck in this cycle of poverty that ruined so many opportunities. I have been stuck in a living situation that is making me poorer, and I can’t leave to rent elsewhere because I don’t have a guarantor and can’t pay three months upfront. It’s I am studying now 4 days a week and working three days, I can only really cover my living expenses. And I know it feels like a cop out to blame my childhood but… I knew this would happen. Not even in a sense of a self fulfilling prophecy, but because I was a smart kid and I made the calculations and assessed the likelihood of everything."

There’s nothing inherently wrong with us, despite what our subconscious brains have been led to believe, we’ve just had the misfortune of being put in abusive environments that cleverly gaslighted us into thinking that *we’re* the problem.

Children, in order to survive abuse, modify their behavior and thinking as if it’s *their* fault. Maybe this is reinforced if you were bullied in school. And if you grew up in America or other individualist nations, you’re constantly told about how any misfortunes that happen to people are the fault of the individuals suffering, not systems, and that “there is no such thing as society”.

However, it’s just indoctrination, not inherent truth. Had we been born in better environments, we’d be the same person, but with much healthier self-image beliefs. It’s the same as how a person born into a tribal cult wouldn’t have their beliefs if they were born into a different tribe; it’s just cultural indoctrination, not inherent truth. Once this is truly understood, the only remaining question is of how to *undo* the brainwashing."

CPTSD,"Reminder: The mod team here is an all-volunteer group of people who themselves have CPTSD. They are not a ""them"" to your ""us."" It's just ""us.""",190h0fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/190h0fq/reminder_the_mod_team_here_is_an_allvolunteer/,https://www.reddit.com/user/thewayofxen,thewayofxen,2024-01-07 02:15:02,"Reminder: The mod team here is an all-volunteer group of people who themselves have CPTSD. They are not a ""them"" to your ""us."" It's just ""us.""","I retired from moderating here more than a year ago now, after a four year stint. I have since had regular conversations with the mods I left behind, and I learned another one has just stepped down due to stress, leaving a skeleton of a team in place (most of those names you see are inactive).

On their behalf, I want to let you all know a few things about how moderating works, so you can tune your criticism and feedback appropriately:

**Moderating is an unpaid volunteer position:** Angry people used to accuse me of gaining all kinds of things from moderating, most especially some kind of high from feeling powerful. I can assure you that regularly being called a dictator by racists and homophobes did not make me feel powerful. It made me feel triggered and stressed. After four years of moderating, I made a few friends, gained some vague sense that I did something good, probably grew into a more mature person than I otherwise would've been, and I made exactly zero dollars. That's all that's in it for a moderator of a space like this.

**Moderators are not responsible for what gets posted here:** Content moderation on the internet is a three-step process:

1. Assholes post
2. Witnesses report
3. Moderators clean

Don't make the mistake of blaming moderators for what happens in Step 1. This is a public community, and there is a never-ending string of randos waltzing in and saying whatever they want. Any specific comment you see is not any indication of what the mod team approves of, condones, or allows. It's just a turd someone left for all to see that has yet to be removed. The mod team is far too small to read every comment that comes through (and no, you could not have a big enough team to read everything. Not for free, anyway), so until you report it, that comment is going to stay up.

**The goal of moderating is a safe-ish space, not a safe space:** Because of the above reason, moderators can not and will never achieve creating a ""safe"" space. Safe spaces are small and private. Big, public online spaces are about as safe as a crowded city street. That's not the fault of the mod team; that's just the nature of a quarter million people using the same subreddit. Post and read here with that in mind.

**When you attack the mod team, you attack this community:** As a moderator here, you spend a lot of your time reading a lot of terrible stuff. You put yourself in the middle of fights, deal with people who are wildly triggered and out of control, and you confront a lot of really awful people who are just here to cause trouble. It's a very stressful job and if they didn't do it, this community would be shut down. I mean that literally; Reddit shuts down unmoderated communities. So be mindful when talking to them, giving feedback, or if you really have to, giving criticism. Don't put your issues on them, don't treat them like ""others"", and don't use them as an opportunity to vent your frustration with authority. Remember: They are volunteers with CPTSD just trying to do a good job. For free.

That's all, I guess. Incidentally they are now short-staffed, so if you feel like taking on this difficult, thankless job, shoot them a message in mod mail. I'm sure they'd appreciate it, and the community will be better for it.

Thanks."

My family and I cannot afford the monthly treatment so we decided to put him to sleep so he isn’t in pain at least.

I still live at home and it’s been hard having to continue to live in the same environment that has caused me so much pain. I have no healthy relationships within my family, I have no friends or acquaintances, and I’m on winter break for school so I can’t even drown myself in schoolwork. 

I just don’t know what to do. It sounds stupid, but this cat is literally the only being who has shown me anything close to unconditional love. It’s like every website, forum, therapist, friend, etc. recommends a pet during a hard time. I know it’s for the best and I would never make him deal with the pain just to be here for me, but I have no idea what to do because I am having to say goodbye to the only thing I have close to a support system as pathetic as that sounds. 

I’ve dealt with pet loss before, but this time is so so different. I’m crying not only because I am losing my best friend, but also crying knowing I have to go through these next few years on my own. Cuddling with my cat has been the closest thing I have had to a hug in years. I wish I was being dramatic when I say that I have no one else to turn to. 

Any advice about coping is welcomed and appreciated. As long as it isn’t get a new pet, because I can’t."

I know it's my meds because when I'm off then I don't have this issue. My doctor has mentioned that some psyche meds like mine will effect your metabolism, causing crashes like this.

But it is so debilitating. I literally cannot function at all. I can't drive because I'm so tired I feel drunk. I can't cook. I can barely summon the energy to use the bathroom, feed my cat and make a bowl of cereal.

Otherwise I'm basically fucking helpless. I'm essentially a zombie with no ability to focus. I can't even hold a conversation.

I am also ND (which may be relevant re: communication styles & my failure to understand/see red flags until it was too late). I have been no-contact with my family of origin for decades. I have spent the last 6+ years in intensive trauma therapy and have achieved the most safety and security I’ve ever had. That sense of safety & security was negatively impacted by an interaction I had with a formerly ""safe person"" & the fall-out from it.

Earlier this year, I reconnected with an old friend (35M) from school after I relocated (we had been communicating regularly for the last five years). Back in the day, he was the first and only person to explicitly tell teenage me that my family did not treat me well, and that I did not deserve it (I couldn’t see it; a fish in water). That comment changed the course of my life, and I will be forever grateful for it.

Fast forward to this fall, we started exploring our sexual connection for the first time. My body and nervous system felt safer with him than with anyone else; I was able to be fully present and vulnerable, and it felt like he was as well. Over 2.5 months, there had been two (what I thought were) small miscommunications during intimate activities that we did not discuss. So we set time aside to meet. We intended, mainly, to debrief what happened a week earlier when I was triggered into an emotional flashback for the first time during play (he stopped, supported me, and the flashback resolved; I subsequently, unconsciously regressed/was vulnerable during aftercare).

When we sat down, everything felt fine. I was embarrassed about getting triggered and regressing (this had never happened before). I explained that it was not his fault, and it was only because I felt safe with him/supported, and that now I was aware of \[the trigger\], I would be mindful moving forward. I then turned to ask him about his experience/thoughts/feelings.

He paused, and I felt the room chill. I looked up and saw a flash of surprise/contempt, the smirk, and then his eyes went black (I am very familiar with these expressions/changes in demeanor, from personal and professional experience). Time slowed down. I had never seen this side of him, and froze. He stood up from the couch, physically moved closer to me, and raised his voice for the first time in my presence. All I remember is the look on his face, hearing him yell “that wasn’t what I wanted at all!”,being seized with terror, and then blacking out.

When I came to, over an hour had gone by, and I was curled up in a fetal position on the couch (my head was down at a severe angle; it had been that way the whole time). As my awareness started to come back, I realized that I/part of me was crying and whispering in a small voice “I’m sorry” and  “I’m so ashamed.” I could not look at him, but I heard him say simply: *“Good.”* That shook me awake. He was then telling me that he did not want to be intimate with me anymore and that he was indifferent re: continuing our friendship. He got up to leave shortly thereafter, hugged me and said ""I am not giving up on this relationship."" I was so confused even after he left, because he was here for roughly 90 minutes, I only remembered the first 10-15, and I felt like a sad, guilty, and scared younger version of myself.

In the days after, he refused to engage in conversation. Over the course of 4 days, I sent him 3 voice memos in my triggered/activated state, trying to explain what happened during the sit-down and the week before, and apologizing/blaming myself for all of it. A week later, back in my present mind, I sent him another reiterating that I had no memory of our sit-down and needed to know what he observed/remembered. A few days before Xmas, he replied via text that he could not continue with our relationship and blocked me.

This experience was unnerving, re-traumatizing, and dysregulating. Only now, weeks later, am I starting to feel safe again. I was blindsided and felt betrayed, by both his destructive expression of contempt/anger, projection of toxic shame, as well as him fleeing/blocking me after I told him that I needed to know what happened when I was shut down.  I could not help but feel like he blamed me for my flashbacks, despite being aware of them/my trauma, as well as for bringing them up/trying to have a dialogue.

Looking back, there were a handful of red-ish flags that emerged over the last few months, mostly some passive aggressiveness and negging; he seemed to approach some of our platonic interactions like there was some power play, but it was entirely one-sided. *OTOH*, he always did whatever he said he was going to do, supported me in concrete ways (pet care; medical emergency), and his words and actions usually aligned.

He was the first person I've let in/been fully myself with in many years. I feel so stupid for trusting him all this time, for letting him into my home and my adult life, and for not being able to defend myself in the moment. I don’t know whether we will ever speak again, or when/if I will recover the memories from the shutdown. I wish he had just left me alone. I find myself wondering when he decided to target me (premeditated or opportunistic), if he has always hated me or why he pretended to be my friend all this time.

**Is there some more charitable interpretation of events, or gray areas, that I'm not seeing? Is it possible that, despite the visible evidence to the contrary, this was not intentional/he did not enjoy it (he leans sadistic)? Or did I dodge a bullet, and should just focus on healing & moving on?**

TLDR; Friend lashed out and triggered a shutdown, refused to discuss it, and abruptly ended our 15-year relationship; I don’t know whether he played a fucked up long-game for nearly two decades, or what the heck this was/what he got out of it."

I want to healthy life worth living with my amazing boyfriend and chosen family and without those toxic people in my life that have been draining me. My dad is one of those people.

Ever since I was little my dad hasn’t been a good person. He struggles with his mental health yes, but he uses it as an excuse to act out in toxic and abusive ways and treat people poorly without consequence. He has been coddled and catered to all his life. People walk on eggshells to avoid setting him off and I am sick of it. My childhood was full of trauma because of him. Anytime he didn’t get his way he would act out and sometimes even try to hurt himself in front of me and my siblings. Police were called so many times, so many of his ex girlfriends would come and go, it was an insanely unstable environment. He always played the victim too. No matter what he was always the victim in every situation.

Over the years he would “get better” for a short period of time, but he always went back to his old self. No change has ever been genuine and seemed more like a game to him. He would pretend to be better and sometimes he would be really convincing but after a while I just stopped believing his act and started seeing him as he really was and honestly, I don’t want that kind of person in my life at all. 

This is my fresh start and he doesn’t get to be in it. Just today he was crying at me saying he didn’t deserve any of this treatment and that I was acting like a brat. He said he wanted a relationship with me, but he doesn’t even go out of his way to have a real conversation with me ever. He doesn’t know me at all yet he’s acting like he has every right to stay in my life like he owns me. 

Part of me feels bad but I feel like this is the right thing to do. Any advice? "

I learned as a chronically I’ll child with career driven and busy parents that I could “only” be given affection and love if I was sick or hurt. (I’m not actually sure this is the case, and that my parents weren’t affectionate with me otherwise, but this is what’s stuck..)

And so I went ahead and spent my teens and most of my twenties hurting myself as much as I possibly could by deliberately making my mental issues worse, engaging in self harm, seeking sexual relations that were degrading.
In short, I figured that that was how I thought I could earn/deserve some basic level of affection and care. 

I’ve been on a steady and good path of recovery for the past two years and have slowly been unravelling my issues and the consequences of this part of my past.  Obviously, I have issues, and as I unmask and deal with the real trauma I incurred on myself I find myself caught in between a rock and a hard place, especially in the context of sex.

I’ll occasionally experience emotional flashbacks and have intrusive thoughts pop up. Often I’m able to suppress them and mask over them, but usually that means that I over do it an am unable to really be present during the act itself. Like, it isn’t super bad, and not as bad as it used to be where I would zone out entirely, but I definitely am not able to fully relax. At one level I also feel an element of guilt, as I know that to an extent I also need to not repress them in the moment. But at that moment I also feel like I’ll mentally be expecting the flashback/intrusive thoughts to pop up, so that I’m in a way “fishing” for them. It’s at that point where I struggle knowing whether to shut out and mask or let it just happen, cause I know that there’s a side of me lurking that wants to have the trauma reaction it because I hope and  think that it’ll give me that care and validation that I crave from my partner. 

Surely I’m not the only person to experience this crux and won’t be the last to either. Have any of you dealt with this, and have any thoughts to lend to think about the issue differently, or advice or resources or literally anything that may help me figure this out?"

I want my life to be boring and simple now. No more surprises please. I don’t remember when was the last time I didn’t feel sick, I didn’t feel pain, I didn’t feel hopeless. No more surprises PLEASE!"

CPTSD,Ten years ago today,190bk8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/190bk8d/ten_years_ago_today/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Savings-Pace4133,Savings-Pace4133,2024-01-06 22:05:16,Ten years ago today,"Today marks ten years since the day I felt like I lost my innocence. January 6, 2014. Something clicked in that fucked up brain of mine that awakened me to all of the horrible things that were happening to me, mainly at school. I don’t wanna say I took the redpill, but it was kinda like the Matrix. At home it was how my dad was failing me, how my mom was overcorrecting his mistakes but those paled in comparison to school.

In 2014 I spent most of the year just trying to survive. I had started middle school in fall 2013 and that environment was toxic and mean spirited unlike elementary school. I was one of the losers in my grade and most of my teachers and the administration were horrible people. Being neurodivergent back then was much more unforgivable to the eyes of education than it is today, even as a high achiever like myself. I pushed myself so hard and burnt out over shit that would never matter in my life. I had panic attacks almost daily. And it all started on that Monday that I woke up for school in the middle of the polar vortex and suddenly was awakened to the injustice happening all around me.

There had been warning signs before 2014, like in 2012, and my personality was such that this was bound to happen. The adults in my life don’t know how horrible it got, and I don’t think anybody could’ve imagined the darkness I endured being that strong, but it happened.

So much of my trauma responses are born from this period. It’s where the passive suicidal ideation really began, although there had been moments previously.

I just can’t believe I’ve been carrying this burden for ten years now, and I’m 20 turning 21 in August, so it’s almost half my life. Thankfully it hasn’t been as hard of a day as I was expecting it to be."

I have been emotionally/mentally unwell for as long as I remember. I swear I tried everything I heard of in order to get better. I started reading psychology and self help books since I was in school to help me get rid of my anxiety and social phobia. I kept  trying for years but nothing improved. Then I joined a self help program which opened my eyes on many other problems I have, but that's all it did, it didn't improve my mental health. Then I started taking sessions with a therapist. I kept seeing her for two years. And I did everything she told me to do. But nothing changed. Then I joined a dbt group that lasted for months and I did everything that I was asked in the group until I completed it. But still, it didn't help me at all, in fact, I think it made my condition worse. Then I started seeing a new psychiatrist. That's when I was diagnosed with CPTSD. I tried different medications with her, some of which I kept taking for more than a year, but I didn't see the slightest effect on my mental health.

At this point I have tried CBT, DBT, IFS, EMDR and some other approaches as long as different medications. Did I gain anything? Just the realisation that I have way too many problems and that I live with awful parents.

And I know that's why I am not improving. I know I have to leave them and go NC but I not in a good state -financially- to do that. I am trying and  doing my best but I just live in a place where wages are really low while rent (with flatmates of course) is really high.

I keep praying that I will be able to leave and get better some day, but I just don't know if I will ever be able to do that.

But if I can't do that, or until I do that, is it okay that I just live miserably and can't do the basic self care? I can't eat well, I can't shower, I can't sleep well. I don't do anything well. 

I don't even know if I am able to do these basic things and I choose not to do them, or that I am truly uncapable of taking care of myself.

Sorry for the long post. If you reached this point then thank you."
CPTSD,Can't make myself eat because of a stupid joke,190am81,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/190am81/cant_make_myself_eat_because_of_a_stupid_joke/,https://www.reddit.com/user/ElvisCossieT,ElvisCossieT,2024-01-06 21:25:18,Can't make myself eat because of a stupid joke,"My hubby knows most of what happened to me as a kid. He knows I have major issues around food, whether I deserve it/am worthy of it etc. This is a holdover not just from my biological parents, but my first and second foster families, too. I used to have to steal if I wanted food, and later in care I wasn't allowed certain foods (namely chocolate) because I didn't deserve it with the first family, and the second family made sure I knew I was getting the supermarket value versions where their kids are branded etc. 

It's taken a long time to train myself out of thinking that I don't deserve to eat. I'm overweight, and have been since my teens expect for a year when I went Keto and got very very physically fit. Like running races level fit. 

The pandemic triggered a binge eating disorder in me where I was buying and hiding food constantly, terrified I'd be found out but completely unable to stop myself. Hubby helped me through it, convinced me to go to therapy, and since the CBT for that I've been   fine for 2 years.

Got a tattoo yesterday to commemorate my marriage. Been together 7 years (my first relationship, I'm 33), lived together 6, bought a house together 4 years ago. We were supposed to get married 2020, but you can guess why that got delayed. My hubby got his tattoo first, 4 years ago, and it's taken this long for the artist to be available to do mine after the pandemic. Our baby is 7 months old and it was my first day without her, so we made it a special day (as much as being repeatedly stabbed by tiny little needles can be special) and I got a selection of my favourite treats to enjoy throughout the day as my blood sugars dipped.

It hurt so much that I actually lost my appetite, so we only shared one bag of chocolates.

I've been working on telling him how it feels to me when he eats all of or most of something I've bought for myself, and how important it is in my head that we each have certain foods that our ""mine"" and ""yours"" - I never touch his cakes, or croissants, etc and wouldn't dream of it unless he offered - as I've noticed I'm becoming snappy with him for drinking my coke or whatever. 

This morning, seeing all the unopened treats, he was like ""score! Chocolates!"" and I said to him that I would be upset if he ate more than half of anything. It was just to tell him that that is how I would feel. 

He just said ""well you've already had your tattoo, you don't deserve these too!"" And I know it was a joke. It really was, I could tell on his face it was a joke, and as soon as he saw my face he knew he messed up. I held it in for a little bit but broke down changing baby's nappy, and he tried to comfort me but all I have heard in my head since is that I don't deserve this food, I don't deserve these treats, I'm not good enough, I'm not worthy.

I have literally had to force myself to ask him if I can have what little I have managed to force down today. A banana. 2 mini sausage rolls (when I say mini I mean half the size of a little finger, they're tiny) and a slice of toast. I'm hungry. My stomach hurts. I'm on amoxicillin for a tooth infection, and I know I should be eating at least something.

But the little girl inside of me is convinced that I don't deserve it, and now I can't make myself have anything else. 

Just wanted to tell someone how I'm feeling. They're both asleep, and I'm looking at yet another night where I won't be able to turn my stupid brain off long enough to sleep myself."

When I was little, I was exposed to domestic violence involving my mom trying to kill my dad infront of me many times, when she was unstable and not on meds. One incident when she tried to go after him with a knife, I got in her way trying to prevent her from chasing after him, she held the knife above my head and acted like she was gonna stab me, I remember I slightly ducked down. One night they got into another argument, she got a wooden board with long nails, and held it up like she was gonna hurt him with it, and told me to leave the room so she can do it, then I remember my father telling me not to leave the room, I just stood there crying and I didn’t know what to do in that moment, she had blood all over her mouth, and I was scared. As my brother got older, he got into drugs and would get violent towards my mom and tried to kill her many times, involving him slitting his wrists right infront of me because he was full of rage from coming off meth. His aggressive screaming is something I would never forget and sometimes I replay it in my head. Many times when my parents got into it, as a little girl, I felt as if I overreacted to the situation, like going outside screaming for help and crying for the neighbors to hear and it never worked. I would scream so loud trying to stop it and it never worked, next day my voice would be strained. It happened many times. I’m still like that to this day as an adult, I have this exaggerating reaction when they get physical with eachother even though it’s not as bad as it was in the past, I will get super shaky and start crying out loud for someone to hear me."

I've been struggling with some feelings lately and wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone else has experienced something similar. I grew up in a country different from my parents' origin and had a tumultuous childhood, with a parent with anger management issues and bullying at school. I believe my CPTSD stems from these early life experiences.  
Here's what's been on my mind: whenever I'm in my home country, where I spent a significant part of my childhood, I feel incredibly lethargic and disconnected. I lack motivation and often feel lonely and negative, despite recognizing that there are great communities around. It's like a dark cloud over me, and I spend my days inside bored, waiting for them to be over. 

However, when I travel to other countries, it's like a switch flips. I suddenly feel motivated, alive, and eager to connect with people and my surroundings. I am full of energy and it's like I realize life can be fun. It's a stark contrast that's become more and more pronounced. I haven't pinpointed what exactly about my home country triggers this shift in me.  
Does anyone else feel this sense of boredom and disconnection in their home country or a place they've spent a lot of time in? How do you cope with these feelings? I'm interested in hearing your experiences and any insights you might have. I hope that hearing from others who understand might shed some light on how to feel more comfortable in my home country.  
Thank you for reading and for any thoughts you share."

He has offered me some free sessions saying I can pay him back when I become super successful and he also reassures me a lot that I am a good person etc etc. 

It’s just not what I expected out of therapy. I’m starting to feel like I owe him something, and that I have to please him in a way which is making me feel so uncomfortable.

I have just started back at work after some time off, and had one great day where I felt in control and that if anything came up I could just breathe and calm myself back down. 

At the start of the second work day i felt really tense and distracted and tried to calm myself down using 'home base' - breathing and checking in with myself -  but when this repeatedly didnt work throughout the day I kinda started panicking and attacking myself for it and making myself feel worse.

I wondered if anyone had any good techniques for stopping this spiral happening. I am really hard on myself and whenever something I thought was helping temporarily isnt happening properly it always feels like regression which makes me feel panicked and I just continually mentally beat myself up and tell myself everyone thinks im strange because im not talking and that i'll never achieve the things i want because i cant even exist calmly in the world."

See, in a public forum/setting where I am interacting with multiple people at a time, I do great, I can interact freely and express myself fully. But when it comes to direct messages or one on one conversations, I'm just.. not the same. 

I feel stumbly and awkward, i keep it very short and instinctively just say and contribute enough to be sure they are comfortable, but its often not a real conversation. I dont feel right, some part of me sees him everywhere in these conversations, even when its obviously not the case.
""its just a matter of time that theyll hate you too"" that part of me says.

I can tell im afraid. Terrified even. The thought of dissapointing people interpersonally just tears me apart, im afraid of not being enough. I dont want to be hurt again, i dont want to be coerced again, i dont want to feel like that again, months of someone just playing with your emotions and fears on purpose, just to get you to conform. 

But when its multiple people around, im suddenly fine. Like this glow of community obscures the voice and i can interact normally. Its a little hard to explain, especially since its often the other way around from what i see in people, but in my case, no. Ive avoided so many social opportunities, dms of people who genuinely have a reason to like and value me enough to interact with me personally and consider me a freind, but i just.. cant without forcing myself to. 

So i guess i wanted to know the communities thoughts and if you go through this too. I want to learn how to move on from my pain and enjoy what i used to. One on one conversations can be very beautiful and deep in a way that public ones dont often match."

My parents fucked all three of us over emotionally and financially. 

We were neglected and abused in more ways than one, but never to the point where CPS was called. I don’t think I realized just how bad it was until I was in college and the years following. As my resentment has grown, our relationship has become more estranged. I still make somewhat of an effort to keep in touch and see them on holidays, but we’re distant. 

I keep seeing posts about filial responsibility laws and how you can be financially responsible for your parents’ medical bills and care as they age, and even the thought makes me FURIOUS. I’m in a state that does have filial responsibility laws (NC). My dad will probably be fine, but my mom has become addicted to being in debt and has no retirement savings. I graduated college with tens of thousands of dollars in debt because they never saved a penny for me (despite being able to afford it) and then surprised me with that information 1 week before I went to college. 

I was riddled with anxiety for years and took on second jobs to stay on afloat financially because of their lack of caring for me. I’ve worked so hard to pay off my loans and actually ended up creating a comfortable (but not rich) life for myself. Yet I will have to pay for my deadbeat mom’s expensive care as she ages?! How is that fair??"

She is uber religious and conservative. Our home country is currently at war and everyone is strung out (rightfully so) because our families are in danger. After an extremely stressful conversation around 5 am  time, after my auntie was asleep, I snuck out into the courtyard to smoke a J, totally forgetting that the housekeeper was cleaning inside. Anyways, I suspect she told my aunty who came barreling outside and confronted me. Before she'd come out I snuffed my j so she didn't actually catch me in the act. I immediately denied it but the stench was obvious. She doesn't believe in mental health let alone cannabis for tremors and PTSD. I vehemently denied it because I genuinely feared for my safety. I've been out of the house all day but sunset is approaching and I have no idea what to do. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? And yes I recognize that it was incredibly idiotic to do this.

I’m tired of being the one who’s been punished my whole f**cking life for being different, for feeling too much, for not coping well because of the abuse. 

I’m really angry that I never learned how to invite healthy relationships into my life. Just fully trusting whoever and assuming that they would be kind and good, only to find out that they’re no different than anyone else. 

I’m tired. This feels so unfair. And so many of us have some type of n/arc in our lives and there’s literally almost no support for that, except for peer support. 

This is lonely. People think that I’m a mess and a wreck. I try though. So much therapy in my life, trying. Journaling, mindfulness all of it.

I have physical illness due to the stress I’ve had for most of my life, I’m exhausted mostly too exhausted to function.

If you dont wanna read so much, skip to ""TLDR"" and read from there, thank you.

Backstory- I have medical PTSD. I also have PMDD and Endometriosis. My medical trauma relates to gynecology so my PMDD feels predictable and fake to me. Its unreal how I know what is going to happen and I still cant stop myself. Basically the week before my excruciatingly painful periods I fully disconnect from reality. I dont shut down, but instead I find myself extremely confused, unable to count, recall details, understand basic situational concepts like who is in a groupchat... and worst of all tripling-down on takes I dont even believe in. 

What happened this time- I had a nice night set out for me and my partner, Videogames followed by him coming over for dinner and a movie. Earlier in the night we were ""Five-stacking"" (aka playing with a full 5 people who were in a call together, so no random matchmaking was involved) I thought it was 4 of us for some reason and I completely shit on our 5th who did literally nothing wrong (I was just pissed I was doing bad). When I realized it was my partner's friend and not a random player in our lobby my heart fucking shatteted. I cant imagine how my partner's friend felt though, I'm sure not great. My severe confusion left me beyond embarassed. I wanted to run away and hide. 
Later in the night, the topic of steven hawking was brought up after discussing what Epstein's flight logs were (this triggered me for sure) while playing CS2 (a videogame) with my partner and their friends. I claimed I never liked Steven Hawking (which I dont really care for him, its true, but I also dont trust most billionare men). When I said this my partnered claimed ""you just made that up, you always think everyone is bad vibes..."" etc. They do this often, saying I stretch the truth but really I'm recalling details wrong and get very frustrated about it. Who doesnt genuinely hyperbolize sometimes too? Its not a crime. But, obviously this triggered me further. I felt attacked in a weird way and I basically said ""Being paralised and a man isnt that bad, try being a woman. Cant walk? Big woop."" My partner said ""okay you're having one of your episodes."" which didnt make me feel any better and I think they could have said it better. My partner's friends were clearly not happy, one of them fully removed their headset. 

When I did question myself and go... do I really believe this shit? No of course I dont, it was small truths (like yea eat the rich, just because you're in a wheelchair doesnt mean you arent still a slimey man, etc.) which I must say, while they are more what I mean ate still things I hyperfixated on that night because of my own frustration with sufferering an invisible disease, getting no recognition for it, having a ptsd diagnosis come out of trying to treat it, it being under-researched and unrecognized, the list bloody goes on. But anyways, the way my thoughts came out were basically those little truths covered by huge vague dissasociative generalized statements that misconveyed my true feelings and could have easily turned anyone in a room away from thinking I had even a semblance of empathy or maturity.

And you ask yourself maybe, why not just stfu? I felt like I was forced to talk, like someone had a knife at my back. But yea, shen we logged off videogames I realized what day it was... PMDD, oh I cant have a normal life. I felt worse, I disasociated more, I felt crazy. I didnt want anybody to forgive me, was it the real me? I'm useless, I'm losing my life to this disease and the damage its seaped into my life. Thoughts you may or may not have had yourself before? Idk


TLDR-
I said ableist shit I didnt believe in generalized statements in front of my partner and his friends because I disasociated. I have PMDD and PTSD so it is very cyclical and although I know it will happen, the more I fight the worse it gets. Anyways, I fucked up. I said morally unacceptable statements that I didnt belive laced with small morally acceptable truths that I do hold- didnt even feel like me saying it...
But then How do I move on now? If its every month... how do I applogize over and over?

Now that you have context, I'm literally chronically ill and I try to advocate for chronically ill people, disabled people, etc. and I truly hate our society's inability to accomidate and instead pave roads on the crushed people's lives under this late-stage ableist capitalism hellscape.

MY RELATIONSHIP-
My partner came over and they confronted me about it, I was still having an episode so I said ""so what?"" ""yea, I think being in a wheelchair would be better than being a woman, so what?"" They were astonished and said ""wow, you're a bad person."" bluntly. I said ""how?"" They then sat down on the couch and didnt say a word. I didnt talk to my partner for 3 hours until as they left when I mustered up the audacity and said ""I told you I wasnt going to be fun to be around."" which is true, I say this in refference to my PMDD because I dont want to use disasociation as an excuse (its my choice to lose it basically, and I feel deep shame in that which comes with my PTSD). they didnt say anything, hugged me and then they left.
On their way back home, I blocked their contacts, deleted it, unplugged my computer, uninstalled discord, etc. etc. Basically I just blamed myself, I feel like I didnt and dont deserve to be forgiven at all. I am a bad person, it would be easier to rot in bed than to burden others with my neurological abnormalities. And yea, I mulled in over all night since I havent been sleeping for more than 3 hours and only during the day for the past week. I think I've come down a little, but I'm writting this reddit post and my PMDD time-frame is not over, so obviously i'm still mixed up like a smoothie but I can see why my actions and words were literal cartoon villain trash.

What do I do?

My thought process/questions-
Do I wait for my partner to respond? Do I deserve forgiveness? I feel that if I say ""i'm sorry"" then great, but PTSD and PMDD and Endo/Adenomyosis dont just go away and since its cyclical I feel I'll just do it again but in a different flavour. Do I'm not going to give some fake apology out so I can keep living like I'm a good person. I want to go to them and express what is happening, the conclusions I've drawn, the insane night I've had like I wasnt even in my own body. But what do I tell their friends? What if its not over yet? I'm afraid above all else that I'll be given forgiveness I do not deserve, repedetively breaking relationship's trust. Its like doing damage control after a child threw a tantrum in a shop and broke something expensive. Exhausting and pointless.

Has anyone struggled like this? How do you repair relationships, what language can I even use to express these PTSD episodes in a way that isnt just a big fat excuse? I have a constant and convenient out for terrible behavior is how I feel, and I didnt trust myself that I was a good person before but after what my partner said... its difficult to think anything but ""scum"" about myself. I mean I cant just apologize though right? Please someone read all this soon and reply. I miss my life. I miss the me I used to be before PTSD took over."

I exercise, eat healthy, get at least 7-8 hours of sleep at night, and I am still sluggish and exhausted every damn day. I also had EBV as a child, so I know that can be a cause for chronic-fatigue even years after having the virus.

I'm at a point in my life now where, for the first time in a *long* *long* time, I have no imminent chaos surrounding me, and I'm not constantly on edge. I believe my nervous system is somewhat calm, and I feel like my body is trying to process and make up for the years.

I don't have an appointment with a therapist until feb.   
I have a friend I used to talk with, but the contact is so one-sided that I have withdrawn; I don't want to be a burden, I don't feel like I matter to them as it is always me making the first type of contact, I  literally get out of bed to care for my kids and return to bed as soon as I am able. 

I don't know how to snap out of this. I feel like i need someone I can talk with, but I am not able to carry the whole conversation. My S.O says little when i talk, i know he tries to listen to take in what i say, but without responses the conversation feels futile, i might as well talk to a wall or to myself.

I increasingly feel like disappearing is the best option for the people around me. I feel like a burden to my friend because I feel like a nag because I always have to make the contact. I feel like a burden because I am not pulling my weight at the moment at work. I feel I am failing as a parent.  I feel I am failing as a partner because i have no more energy left, and I feel like I am losing my other friends because i struggle to connect with the topics that occupies them - it is like I live on my own little planet.

I was wondering if anyone else has felt the same and how they got out of it.  
  
I've always felt like there is a curse hanging over me, that no matter what I do and where I go the toxicity, misery and pain from my family will follow me around and will make me obviously different to others. That it will be something I can't even overcome because my family is still there, still full of the toxic abusive patterns and still full or the decay, despair and pain that they've inflicted on each other and on me. This feeling has led me, a few times, when I've wanted to uproot my life and start a new, but when something horrible happened back home and they tried to rope me in, that I have felt that I can't escape and should therefore return there. I felt ashamed by the things happening at home and by the ugliness and intensity of my emotions and I felt that I didn't belong among people who are ""normal"" and should go back to the place where these emotions make sense.  
  
This kind of feels like a trauma bond, right? I am wrestling with the realisation that I might have sabotaged my life multiple times this way and not taken the leap out of the family and into healing. If anyone has been caught in this dynamic - how did you get out and how did you deal with the grief and guilt of looking back and seeing a pattern that kept you inside the trauma for longer than it should have?"

(Mention of Physical (and Sexual?) Assault),"Hi this is a burner I accidentally made a while ago, cause I'm worried someone in my family could find my main. And I'm not sure I have cptsd, but this was the only place I could think to ask. But for context, I do have autism, bpd, depression, dissassociative disorder, and have flashbacks to traumatic events.

But around a year ago I started to remember a relationship I didn't remember having. Though for 2 years before felt sad, longing, and grief for one I didn't have either. Then I started to fully remember it, that the reason I barely remember my time at college is cause I completely blocked out the memory of this person. I am very private and don't really tell my family much usually, so I had kept her a secret from them. I was also worried they'd be homophobic to her (proudly pan). But I finally decided to tell them, cause I don't have anyone else anymore. They listened and have tried to be supportive, even though for a while they were pressuring me to contact her family, despite the fact they abused her. 

A little after that, I started to see things during my random panic attacks, like wrists reaching down towards my throat and I could feel them. But I didn't mention it cause I thought it was fake since that's all I had. But now I think about it all the time, randomly flashing back to it and getting terrified, seemingly again. I constantly feel the hands on my throat. And have started to remember the feeling of hair brushing my face, blurring yellow-orange lights in the dark, and sometimes something wrapped around ""me"". The panic attacks have gotten worse and culminated in me seeing some random girl with tanned skin, brown hair, and a thin  face and freezing with my heartbeat bursting out of my chest.

So I finally told my brother about it, but he just said. ""You don't remember much, are you sure it wasn't a dream? I've made up whole people in my dreams before, so."" And then found out my whole family thinks I made up at least part of my girlfriend and/or am purposely withholding info. Because I've said I misrembered something or gotten confused on exact timeline or remembered new info later. And he said ""without more I don't know what you want me to do. Its hard to feel sympathy when we don't know anything."" And went on with his day like I hadn't just told him I  have panic attacks and memories of being assaulted 

So I've decided to finally finish school with their government benefits I can receive and be covered for a surgery in a year.

Tldr; my family doesn't believe my repressed memories of grief and assault. That I'm looking for attention or making it up. So I'm gonna use them for their insurance and scholarships then leave and never talk to them again."

But for some reason despite my potential that i was diving into in the last year and all the opportunities that are facing me, im still not taking the ride. 
I often dream about my attachment to her and how im sabotaging myself bc of her, idk maybe my unconscious is sending those dreams ? 
I don't feel that attachment to her i feel like i let go. But for some reasons it seems like it's still there.

I can go in details if anyone has any questions.

Why can't we just be able to tell people what they need to hear and not just what they want to hear? I've been in trauma therapy for 4 years and being coddled is not the way to heal from trauma. We can be a safe space without being a space where nobody is told that they're being unreasonable, unrealistic, offensive, or are overreacting. 

None of us deserved to go through traumatic experiences, but we are still responsible for our actions and how we interact in the real world, so why can't we just stop with the hypersensitivity at any point? 

For example, this girl went off her meds, went off on her mom during the holidays, and felt like a bad daughter. Myself and others straight up told her that she *was* a bad daughter by choosing to go off of her medication, knowing what that would do to her and knowing how it would likely impact her mom. Like, *that* is the sort of accountability I want to see on this sub. We need to stop this infantilization of everyone on here and make people be responsible for their shit.

For whatever reason I reverted to older ways and did things like focus on one or two people instead of my friend, the host. Might have been so out of it I didn’t hear when he or other people were talking or saying my name to get my attention (this happens often actually) and even found myself staring at certain people. This is not my norm but was before I started healing triggers and trauma. My friend didn’t even get up to say goodbye when I left like he usually does.  
I feel everyone knew I was ignoring him (except me.. ) and I feel embarrassed and guilty.

I sent him an impulsive text this morning saying oh I am having hearing trouble but clearly didn’t think it through because that doesn’t negate that I ignored him for whatever subconscious reason.

I have done EFT, talked to child and critic. Acknowledge I’m safe in this moment. Sat with the discomfort that this is life, I make mistakes. I have to forgive myself. I’m glad it’s not the END of the world like it would have been earlier in my healing journey. Realized I should probably give him space and accept this is how it is and I hurt him. just lost so many people in the past and its disheartening and will I have to give everyone in my life 2 months space everytime I get triggered and act from a child place?

He’s not close enough and he’s a guy and I’m a girl to say oh did I hurt you in anyway. I thought about it but I think he would be weirded out if I said that.

I wonder if I missed anything, anything I can do. When I get triggered or dissociate I also don’t have an accurate sense of reality so maybe someone can help.  It would normally feel like the end of the world and I’m dying as from cptsd with parents. But I’m not. I’m just all these emotions from the disaapointment and I hope someone can offer a perspective maybe or even bettter a way to fix it?   (That’s my child talking I know).. or is it?

Do need to accept I made a mistake and maybe heal more before big group outtings too? Should I apologize. What’s my excuse. I’m tired?  Apologize without an excuse?  Bc it’s like sorry my child  wasn’t interested in you and other people instead and for ignoring you even tho I didn’t intend to becuawe I have severe trauma. Or just sorry I was off last night ?

Inside I felt like I was being physically  attacked by my abuser - that he was on me - attacking me - moving my body in such ways and I was trying to get him off of me. In words I was screaming simulataneously  I need to die and begging him to go away and leave me alone. I felt like he was physically attached to me. Like I was physically re-enacting the physical violence/rape experience and reacting to it in the now - physically but with myself???

i used to want to save and protect them when i was younger cuz i didn’t want anyone else to suffer like how i did. but i couldn’t do it anymore. i was sacrificing myself and i had no control over my life.

for my own sanity it took me a long time to let my siblings go and focus on myself instead. it feels soul crushing and like i’m a perpetrator of abuse. and i feel like the same piece of shit like my mom is.

i feel disgusted that i can sort of understand why my mom the way she is now. except it was never my duty to be my siblings’ parent or protector, it was her duty. yet i feel disgusting and like a traitor. sick to my skin. i can’t do anything about it or her. i despise her as a person.

i sort of feel like this about my ex-friend too. but i have to put a boundary. i’m okay if my sibling lashes out at me a bit bc i know our circumstance and, i’ll try to fix our broken family the best i can.

when my friend treats me like shit, they can go fuck themselves and figure it out themself, i’m not their mommy. 

i used to want to believe in found family so badly, but that just gave me the same problems, and just gave my friend permission to be a fucking shit to me. why would i choose a family that treats me like shit again?? it’s stupid. if i’m going to put up with brats, i’ll only allow my siblings to. i don’t have the energy for that childish shit

i kind of miss deep friendships where we’re like a family. but i have too many other problems to deal with. and family is complicated. makes me wish i were an only child like or only had 1 sibling like they did. stupid lucky bastards. they wouldn’t understand one bit

i’m just feeling bitter and got way off topic. idk anymore if leaving them was even a good idea. maybe they were shit and i just need better friends.. they certainly made me feel like it and let me know"

I feel lonely, but I feel it most when I'm healing, recovering, and my life is going well. I'm peaceful, I'm generally happy each day, life should be great. But healing feels like it has dramatically diminishing returns for me when it's in the absence of meaningful connections. 

It feels like no matter how much I improve my circumstances, my life, my health, my finances, anything. It just, it sucks to be lonely. The most awful, crippling, horrible and painful aspect is that the person who abused me, that I suffered CSA due to, is the only person I've ever had a 'meaningful connection' with. I'm sure it's warped my perspective terribly, and it always messes with my head. The lonelier I get, even getting close to two decades away from it, it makes me miss them.

Sorry for the late response, I had a closing shift yesterday then an opening shift today so I'm just getting the chance to read your responses now. Thank you everyone who read my post, I appreciate all of you.

I used to watch her years ago and stopped but couldn't remember why. Anyway I was in a rough place in November and started binge-watching her videos to try to get myself back on track.

At first it was helpful and gave me the courage to leave a friendship that was unhealthy for me. But there were things AR said that gave me pause. Firstly she seemed very judgemental at times. I think I was watching a video about attachment issues and she was saying that it's ""just not attractive"" and puts people off, and normal people won't want to be with you. Which comes off as ""You have to fix yourself to become worth loving and tolerating."" But she said often it was just ""tough love,"" and as someone desperate to improve themselves, I believed her.

One of the videos I watched on isolating (something I'm terrible for) and she was basically saying that other people can tell and ""think you're weird."" I was kept isolated growing up so I've had to work really hard on my social skills but still experience a lot of social anxiety and struggle to enjoy being around others because I'm used to being alone. I felt I had gotten to the point where I was getting more confident and expressing myself and even building friendships, but what she said started to eat away at me and I felt like everyone was just putting up with me and I was lucky I had some people that were tolerant enough they didn't mind that I was ""weird."" I started questioning everything I was saying and feeling like people were going to reject me because being traumatized would make everyone run away.

The biggest flag of all was being reminded every video about ""her technique"" (which someone else taught her and to my knowledge, doesn't get credited for) and course, FB group, etc. I'd also signed up on her website for her free course and the marketing emails were CONSTANT.

But like most people here, I ignored the red flags and assumed I was ""just being negative"" so I allowed her views to live rent-free in my head because while I knew some of it was wrong, some of it made sense. I started to spiral and lose my progress. I felt depressed and helpless. I stopped going to a group I enjoyed because I thought everyone would think I was weird, and yet also felt terrible because I was ""isolating"" in her terms. For the first time in months, it was getting so bad again I seriously considered not living anymore so I could stop inflicting myself on other people.

Anyway, I came here to search what people thought about her. And WOW. I wish I had looked sooner because I feel like a huge weight has come off my chest. I don't feel alone anymore in what my gut was telling me. Honestly I feel like there could be a pinned post of creators who should be avoided, so others can avoid this experience too.

I guess the big lesson I'm learning is to be more careful with what I allow to influence me. I like to think I'm strong and can just brush it off, but this whole thing goes to show I can't do that at this point in time because I will take one thing someone says and allow it to destroy my mental health.

(Edit 7/1: I thought I would clarify this point further to avoid confusion. I didn’t initially elaborate because I didn’t want to write a novel about this and other aspects of my story. So: I have less issue with the concepts AR’s putting forth, rather the loaded language and negative connotations of her delivery is triggering. I have mentioned this in a comment but I will say it again, at this point in my journey I have a very honest relationship with myself and don’t shy away from the ugly truth. I have no problem calling myself out on my BS, which is why I tried to take AR’s advice constructively and work through how I felt. 

However, I found it triggering regardless of trying to intellectualize around her abrasive delivery. She might be speaking the truth, but there are many ways of expressing your point without causing unnecessary injury to people who are vulnerable. I’ve learned I’m still quite sensitive to people who use equative language, where a word and its related concepts are assigned a black-or-white meaning that is often tied up in shame and morality. Word associations are highly personal as well, and what is neutral or even positive to some can be highly negative to another person, which is why some people have no problem overlooking what she says and others can’t handle it. I think as well people underestimate the damage that can be done growing up in an environment with people who don’t verbally abuse but use implication, black-and-white reasoning, and equative language to control and wound their targets. I’ve been thinking a lot since I made this post and it’s led to a lot of insight for me, which will help me deal with these triggers in the future.)"

I returned and our General Manager stormed in screaming over and over that I'm never to leave my area. I told him I was entitled to leave & would do the same thing in the same situation. We were understaffed & all the heat was on me- no relief either. I was literally standing off to the side behind a partition, I did't leave, just stood aside for under five min.

The surrounding rental desks (in an airport) did NOTHING to help me feel better or offer ANY support.  
Is this a toxic place? Sounds like it.

CPTSD,Adderall & Meth - predisposition?,18zxqu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zxqu4/adderall_meth_predisposition/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Salty_Challenge5563,Salty_Challenge5563,2024-01-06 11:07:25,Adderall & Meth - predisposition?,"I was diagnosed with “ADD-like symptoms from PTSD.” I had a brain scan and they could actually see all the bits that were firing and which were not, it was amazing. They could pinpoint that all the things I’ve been experiencing since my teens such as inability to focus, foggy memory, quadruple tasking but not finishing were a byproduct of C-PTSD, but not actually proper ADD. 

I was also recently told that my mother - who had borderline personality disorder and I estranged myself from years ago - used to take meth before I was born. This was a massive shock to me. I don’t even drink and I don’t take recreational drugs, but I was prescribed adderall when I lived back in the states. It made me completely focus and calm, it made all my future-focused and social anxiety dissipate, sort of like a zen-like robot (as it also made my normal emotional personality neutralise.) It made me stop being a people pleaser and feel less agitation. The adderall also allowed me to get through university and when writing an essay, getting everything in my head onto the page without constant white noise and jumbling. When I started the adderall, my mother asked me for some and as I was 16 I couldn’t say no, and then she went to the doctor saying she had ADD so she could get a script (this was in 2005 when it wasn’t as hard to get a script.) She gloated that she loved it made her concentrate and get everything done, while stopping her appetite. 

My question is whether redditors think there could be a genetic predisposition to stimulants, when diagnosed with different things? I didn’t realise how similar the effects of adderall are to meth (just looked this up) and am very curious. Maybe it’s about receptors not firing correctly or simply people prone to a negative mindset feeling leveled out by uppers? My grandma was diagnosed with severe depression her whole life and I know my mother had it as well, and although I don’t have depression I can easily sink into a negative mindset which I’m very conscious of and practice breathwork/EFT/meditation etc to balance out. 

The meth thing does freak me out and I’m thinking, god, in taking adderall am I just doing a form of what my mother did to combat whatever faulty wiring is in there? Whether by nature or nurture? I stopped taking adderall but saved three pills from my script from three years ago. I took one today as I just started an online master’s course and need to write a massive essay (after a decade university hiatus!) so wanted to write this while I’m feeling it. Now back to the essay!

Thanks for reading and would very much appreciate any considered replies :)

I’ve worked for years to try to overcome this and when he entered my life I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel.

I’m (44F) late and I guess that you all have watched The Last of Us already, but I  binge watched the show just now. If you haven’t watched the show and still want to, please stop reading, there’s spoilers coming. 

I didn’t get why everyone raved about the show so much during the first 2 episodes, but the love story of Bill and Frank moved me deeply. So beautiful. Kind of tore a new hole in my heart, because I’ve never experienced this kind of devoted romantic love.

And then what happened? When Joel searched for Ellie who was being held captive by David, I felt something awaken in me. Painfully. And when he finally found her and held her and said “I got you, baby girl”, I couldn’t stop crying. Finally, episode 9 was bringing this way up to another level for me. 

I spent many, many years in therapy. Most of those years I spent talking about how mentally unstable and sadistic mother has fucked me up beyond repair. Every session was about her. I think it was only 2 years ago or so when I realised that I actually also have “daddy issues”. Mother married 4 times. Biological father abused me physically and neglected me heavily from infancy to the point of putting my life in danger. Adoptive father abused me sexually and just cut me out of his life when he found a new wife to have a son with. He told me he will never allow me to meet “my brother”, will never give me his address and changed his phone number. This has been 25 years ago. And though I know that he is a piece of shit, just like all the other “father figures” mother came up with, the hurt that I have never had a father who loved me like Joel loved Ellie is too much… 

How do I get over this?"

Nope. I merely commented on a recent post that I don't believe it's feasible that a safe space can be created on the internet due to the number of users.

CPTSD,Sibling Abuse: The Other Side,18zwda1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zwda1/sibling_abuse_the_other_side/,https://www.reddit.com/user/TinyImagination9485,TinyImagination9485,2024-01-06 09:32:26,Sibling Abuse: The Other Side,"I (22F) abused my younger sibling  (7 year age gap) for a good portion of their toddler-preteen years.

I wanted to speak out because sibling abuse is criminally understated. I have been trying to find resources for people who *are* the abusers and want to acknowledge the past to heal and grow because I *do* have shame and confusion. My heart is with those who have spoken out and were forced to double-down.

I was physically and/or verbally abusive between the ages of 11-17 and my sibling was 4-11. We grew up in a dysfunctional home. Our father was undiagnosed Bipolar 2 causing him to be extremely volatile and flighty while my mother was a catatonically depressed workaholic; she had no presence at home although she was our primary caretaker after our father finally left.  Thus was the start that I, 8 years old at the time, was left to care for my 1-year old infant sibling.

I was parentified as a child. It was only me and a toddler in a very big house for hours or days at a time. I never had a chance. I took my anger out on the closest vulnerable thing to me because I was so alone in everything. There were times when I completely lost my temper over the simplest things and modeled myself to be an absolute nightmare, similar to our father. Of course I was unaware that the entire dynamic was toxic because every time I reached out to anyone I was gaslit and told, ""These are things older sisters go through."" or my favorite, ""If you don't do it no-one will."", and even ""I provide you with everything you need, so, do as I say"". Imagine my surprise when I found out that there were families that did NOT behave this way.

When I was 15-17 the physical and verbal abuse turned into neglect. If I didn't eat, then they didn't eat, and I wasn't eating because I developed an eating disorder and was catatonic, similar to my mother. Pizza Rolls were a primary food group in my home.

Now my sibling and I still had a lot of really great moments (coincidentally when I was relieved of my parenting duties) and I think those moments are what keeps our relationship hanging on by a thread. These moments didn't happen often, but when they were good, they were great and we do reminisce, which I'm grateful for, however; I believe that deep down my sibling is still afraid of me.

At 18 I ran away and tried to catch the bus. After I missed the bus I had to do a lot of reflection because all I felt was guilt for trying to leave my sibling alone with our fucked up parents. I went to my sibling and apologized for how I treated them without mentioning the reasons why I was so volatile, but I know the conversation isn't over.

I want to bring it up in a non-triggering way that will show that I am deeply regretful and also a victim. It's very hard to call myself a victim because I became the perpetrator and I carry nothing but guilt, but it's the truth. Unlike my parents or anyone else I reached out to as a troubled teen I recognize the cycle of abuse, am willing to admit it and my part in it, AND DISMANTLE IT.

**TL;DR Question 1: How can I bring this up to my sibling in a non-triggering way that will show that I am deeply regretful and also a victim?**

**Question 2: If you are a victim of sibling abuse, what would make you feel safe again overtime?**

**3. If you are a victim of sibling-abuse please share your thoughts, think-pieces, concerns, critiques, questions, literally anything. I want to hear more anecdotes so that I can bridge the gap between my own sibling and I.**

**EDIT 4. Are there any literature or essays that you have read that has resonated with your experience and helped you to work through the trauma?** "

The trauma I've been through in my life has caused me to become hypersexual and I have a deep desire for intimacy and to be loved. But at the same time after multiple negative/unhealthy/counterproductive experiences in that department and a very toxic relationship last year I am too scared to let anyone close to me emotionally whatsoever out of fear of being hurt again etc and feel to much shame and other negative emotions to seek out intimacy even though my cravings for it are so bad it controls my life alot. 

I feel like I should just shut myself off from relationships with people forever because I don't know how to have a healthy one after having so many poor experiences and being surrounded by undesirable people in undesirable places alot of my life. But at the same time I feel a lot of pressure to find a partner, have a family etc; alot of people my age have already had children and are moving on with there lives, already have a set in stone social circle they've been apart of for a while, have goals careers. 

And I'm just stuck here wishing I could have a healthy relationship but am losing hope and becoming more bitter with life the longer I am lonely, and when I am reminded of hookup culture, abusive relationship situations in my life or someone I know, hear of divorces and family drama it discourages me alot because I've never known anything healthy and alot of other people haven't either and the toxic cycles just continue and become the norm in society and it feels like I will never have the ""1960's romance"" I dream about.

Im too scared for another heartbreak, and It hurts too much to be lonely. I don't know what to do."

Recently she said that I'm a waste and honestly I don't disagree. I'm deeply depressed do to how endless it feels. My nightmares have gotten so bad I woke up screaming and trying to ""get it off me"" but there was nothing there. I'm not sure what caused it to get so bad when it had been feeling better. I have a nightlight and it's the only reason I can sleep at all. I'm constantly thinking about how my mom says living life for the sake of living is a waste. She thinks I enjoy this life but she is very, very wrong. I'm afraid of my mental health getting worse. I've been constantly thinking about death.

I am asking for your stories to encourage myself.  Do any of you who are recovering/getting healthier have siblings who are getting healthier themselves too?

 I have a younger sibling who is doing things to hurt himself and risk his life continuously and it breaks my heart to see him constantly suffer the deep pains of our childhood abuse.  Its a very touch and go situation for my sibling tonight and I feel a despair/intense grief tonight about his situation and want to hold on to some hope he will recover and start to have some joy, peace and nurturing relationships.  I passed through my own very dark seasons of recovery from CPTSD and horrible childhood abuse and I now know how bright things can be on the other side and I want that for him too.

 Please give me any positive stories of those of you who have siblings who are also recovering as you are.   I want hope stories of you and at least one family member recovering please.   Hope.  Thanks in advance."

They have taken all of your confidence, all of your past friends. They have taken any hope you have in making a future for yourself. I was 16 when a girl claimed I SA’d her, and then lied and said I did it to other girls and while she was asleep. I was with maybe 2 girls at the time she said that including her. I don’t feel comfortable even looking at a women, I don’t feel comfortable being around men because I got sexually assaulted a few months after that. Nearly 3-4 times a week I attempt suicide, the first I was the closest to right after what that girl said. My mom stopped me right as when I was in the middle of it. I don’t feel safe living in my own city, A lot of the times I’m barely holding on. I saw this girl earlier last year, not too long after seeing a best friend get shot. I don’t know why but the thought came out and said “you have never almost been shot before” which she used as a threat against her. I’ve never owned a gun fired a gun, I’ve only seen one go off once when the bullet missed my head by inches and shot my best friend in his neck. In 5 months I can start the 6 month long expungement process and get it dismissed, I was charged with a terroristic threat and the store owner kicked my other friend out before he could of gave his statement and changed the outcome. My friends death anniversary is in a few days, almost bring 1 year since it happened. Not a day goes by I wish I was the one shot. So I could never think about her and all the people who harassed me ever again."
CPTSD,"I think my dad may have sa’d me as a kid, any advice is really appreciated",18ztp3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18ztp3c/i_think_my_dad_may_have_sad_me_as_a_kid_any/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate-Buy7962,Affectionate-Buy7962,2024-01-06 06:37:13,"I think my dad may have sa’d me as a kid, any advice is really appreciated","I just write this and hope it won’t delete so I’m sorry if this is rushed and full of errors and having a hard time writing this.

For context I’m a 17 year old girl. My parents divorced when I was around 5 and we visited my dad on weekend from that point on. We also used to go to his house for months at some points but that started when I was a pre teen I believe. 

I also have an older brother (2yrs) and younger sister (2 yrs) but I’ve always been favourited  by our dad. It wasn’t a secret, he would admit it and be overly affectionate towards me. I remember being a little kid and uncomfortable by it but I would always try to make him happy no matter what. 

I was as people pleaser as I could be towards eveyy fr one but especially my dad. My siblings used to kinda bully me and I would freak out but my dad would always just tell them to do whatever and we would be alone. (Thing is now that I write that I can’t remember being alone with him but I can remember him telling my siblings to go all the time and then we would be alone?) 

It was to the point his siblings and other people would even tell him to chill out with his affection towards me. He would also always use a baby voice, even to me now and I’m 17. Like a real baby voice you use for a baby or a dog. I hated it. It made me so uncomfortable, when I was a kid I didn’t like it but it was just something I thought was normal I guess. But as I grew up he never stopped and I used to get upset and “fight” with him about it ( literally me breaking down while him and my stepmom say things like “I liked it” or “never used to have an issue” or he’d say he’d stop and then continue the next day). 

For more context my dad met/got with my mom when he was 28 and she was 17. And from what I’ve been told it was literally textbook grooming and the whole story disgusts me. Now he’s with my stepmom whose 30 and he’s 58 (met her when she was new to Canada in her early 20’s and he was her senior). 

Anyways the reason I’m writing this is because I’ve been having awful intrusive thoughts for the past few months. They happened a lot throughout my childhood too but now it’s all I can think about. It’s of my dad and me. And it’s not a full memory but it’s like flashes (I also have always had a really bad disassociating problem and my memory is trash). It’s of my dad and me and being naked and his naked body and his hands and it’s horrible and disgusting. It clouds my brain and eats away at me and I get this horrible feeling of shame and my body tenses up and I cry just from thinking about it too much. 

I haven’t been doing anything sexual with my boyfriend either lately. One time I started having a panic attack essentially because I kept picturing my dad while my boyfriend and I were having sex. I just told him I was overwhelmed which is normal to happen to me during sexual stuff.

I also have a panic disorder sort of thing, I am basically emotionally overwhelmed all the time and also have problems with my self image and self harm for as long as I can remember. About a month ago I cracked and told my therapist I’ve been thinking this stuff about my dad and he’s been really careful to not put any thoughts in my head but also said that I do have signs of serious trauma.

I also dream weird stuff about my dad basically every night. Sometimes there’s something sexual but usually it’s just me as a kid in the house and I’m hiding from him. And I feel that horrible Shame feeling and I’m just so scared. I just want it to stop but it’s clear it’s not going to unless I either figure it out or talk it out or something.

Any advice is really really appreciated. Thank you if you read all that and I’m sorry for any errors."
CPTSD,If you can’t trust your own family who can you trust?,18ztbgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18ztbgr/if_you_cant_trust_your_own_family_who_can_you/,https://www.reddit.com/user/jupiterocean,jupiterocean,2024-01-06 06:14:27,If you can’t trust your own family who can you trust?,"Posting on my alt account to preserve mine and my daughter’s privacy. I just want to get it off my chest and I apologize if this is long.

My four year old daughter a couple weeks back gave me reason to believe she was touched inappropriately by a cousin of mine who is staying at my mom’s (daughter’s grandmother’s) house. To add insult to injury I facilitated my cousin’s sponsorship by allowing my family to use my bank statements as proof that I would support him after immigrating to America. I even did paralegal work to push his case forward as the attorney my family hired was less than useful in the process. 

I told my daughter I believed her, being a victim of CSA myself. My daughter gave me the tightest hug ever… it made all the hairs all over my body go up. I have never felt anything like it. I immediately contacted her pediatrician and the child abuse hotline. CPS was at my house the same night. I requested a child play therapist for my daughter— but as expected, they if anything have been counterproductive in the process. I’m getting her a private play therapist come Monday since they are taking so long to do anything. 

When I told my mom my daughter did not feel safe at her house, do you think she asked who, what, when, where, why, how? No. She berated me and was SO offended as to HOW I could believe she gets anything less than excellent treatment while in her care.

I reminded my mother that she made her choice 25+ years ago to not believe me, twice… And now it was my turn to be a parent, and I don’t fucking care if it means burning all the bridges with my family to the ground—- I fucking believe my daughter and will protect her until my last dying breath.

Do you know what she had the audacity to ask me? I will never forget it. She asked me why didn’t ***I*** report my abuse to my pediatrician as a child if it was true. Needless to say, I hung up on her. She is dead to me. The last thing I did was mail her Paul Walker’s CPTSD book in her language, wrapped up from Amazon with a note that said, “I hope you heal. Happy holidays. —- Jupiter and Daughter”

No one in my family except my sister has contacted me since. If you can’t even trust your own family, who do you trust? I will never be able to feel safe with my daughter being cared for by someone else again. 

I’m not perfect but I’m doing all I can to protect my baby, in a way no one cared to take care of me at her age because it was too much of an inconvenience. I never was too comfortable leaving her with my mom but didn’t have much choice— I empathized with her and forgave her for being emotionally neglectful to me due to her own issues but I could have never imagined after 25+ years she would not have self reflected even a little bit on what she could have done better… I fucking hate myself for giving her the benefit of the doubt that back then she “did the best she could with the resources she had at the time.” Now, after all this I can’t help but view her as anything less than a monster.

To end on a positive note, my daughter is doing well. She does not want to see her grandmother and just wants to be with me. We are isolated right now so I signed her up for gymnastics where I can keep an eye on her as she practices. I work from home so she is now learning how to let me work because I can’t afford childcare after bills and the mortgage as a solo parent. Next week I have an appointment with a community based organization to gather as many resources as possible to get us through this living nightmare.

Thankfully since the incident my daughter has told me numerous times she feels safe, happy, and wants to be with me “forever.” I told her, if that’s how she feels, then I am doing my job right as her parent, and I love her so much and will always believe and protect her, now and always. 

Despite being damaged by my CPTSD, I will keep putting one foot in front of the other to heal— if not for me, for my daughter. I will not allow our generational trauma to define us. We will get through this together and thrive, just me and her— if that’s what it takes.

Thank you to those who took the time to read this. "

We have been together for almost 4 years (our anniverary is January 30th) and he knows about my traumatizing past. I am managed by a wonderful mental health team and do a lot of good work regularly to keep myself even-keeled and mostly panic attack free. My trauma has previously caused suicide attempts, but it has been 17 years since my last attempt. 


A large recurring issue in our relationship is him not being able to support me emotionally. We have done individual therapy and couples therapy, but he would never stick with it long enough for meaningful change to occur. It seemed like when it came to my emotional safety, he just never thought it was as important as I said it was. 

Anyway, Wednesday of that week, I got some tough news and hadn't seen my fiancé since Sunday due to a dog-sitting commitment. I reached out via text and called him numerous times to talk, but I was met with his own shit instead of listening to me and being supportive. 
By Friday, despite our having plans together, I'd had it. I did not want to be around him and told him as much. I told him to his face that he fucked up again and dropped the ball when I really needed him. In my anger, I said that even if I'd wanted to hang myself, he would not have noticed. 

Well, he took that one part of my whole rant and took flight with it. I left the house saying that I wanted him gone when I returned and went back to my dog-sitting duties. I turned off my phone because he kept calling and texting
. 
2 hours later, I return to my home and he is still there. He called my therapist (who I had spoken to THAT DAY, about 6 hours prior) and expressed to her that he couldn't reach me and he was afraid I'd harmed myself. She called me and we chatted, set a time for the next day and hung up. My therapist has since told me her professional opinion was that I was pissed at him and not a danger to myself. She was right, but it didn't matter. He had already called 911 and reported that I had a knife and was hurting myself. I didn't know this until I got home and he said ""You're probably going to be mad, but I called the police."" 
There was an APB out on my vehicle and I had absolutely no clue. I was absolutely shocked when I saw police officers surrounding my home. 

Right then and there I told him that now it really was over. A police officer patted me down in my driveway, convinced I had a knife. I did not. I was taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and ultimately released, but I am not without trauma from this incident. 

About 5 days later, I attempted to reach out to my fiancé and he still has not spoken with me. His father, who helped him move out, gave me more validation than he likely ever will. 

Am I the actual asshole or was I just duped for 4 yesrs while trying to keep it together for both of us? Clearly I need some validation because I cannot make sense of anything- from the events of that evening to his subsequent coldness and ignoring me. 

And why did the police listen to a hysterical man who had no basis on which to make such a call? What happened to 72 hours!?"

It came up this evening and he wanted to discuss further, and I just couldn’t, because I had almost zero recollection of what we discussed. I wasn’t drunk and I do not understand why this happens, but it’s now caused an even more immense separation between us and I need to desperately work on myself so I can fix it and mend things within myself and my cherished partnership.

Traumatic event after traumatic event. It's as if the view from here is just jarring. I thought things that weren't true. Serious mind-bending hear-stopping things. I was incredibly naive. And I see it with such clarity. I see I will never be able to just relax and finally feel loved. And there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

I am being reborn and it is so painful to think I'd had a life and now that life, as I knew it, is gone and so are many family members this past year. My father will also pass soon. It will be so very different going forward and I feel I've never known who I am or what I really am made of. I'll be 53 this month. That's a long time to not know oneself. Who could I possibly be now? Can I get that little girl back? Can she have a do-over? No, I don't think she can. 

I am so thankful for my children. I hate though, that they've become my reason for staying in what has become, I can't even think of the words to describe my environment right now, but chaotic comes close...ish. But they don't deserve my childhood. They are the sweetest beings and the only light left in my heart. It is for them that I am willing to give up my dreams of feeling and being loved in the way I need. I will find a way. I always do. I just wonder who I will be in the end, because right now I feel like a total stranger to myself.

CPTSD,cptsd from religious trauma?,18zry3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zry3j/cptsd_from_religious_trauma/,https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaysoicanweep,throwawaysoicanweep,2024-01-06 04:58:08,cptsd from religious trauma?,"hey all. i’ve been doing some research on shame and toxic shame and it’s been very very cathartic and eye opening to me. i think this deep sense of shame and guilt has been projected onto me by my parents have since birth (literally)

i was born premature. i was supposed to be due by january but came out in october. every horrible thing you can think of, the doctors said i was going to have. wheelchair, blind, deaf, down syndrome. many times they offered my mom to get an abortion. i also had a very very complicated birth. they had to take me away immediately to either give me oxygen or heart surgery i don’t remember. i had lots of surgeries when i was a kid. had to get my retinas reattached, heart and kidney surgeries. had to stay in a incubator for months before they brought me home. i very recently saw a photo of me in the incubator having my last rights read to me while my mom cried.

my parents were always religious, my mother a devout christian and my dad a catholic. my mom and dad have an interesting relationship. my mom basically chased my dad since the day she laid eyes on him in 9th grade. he only noticed her in college when she grew her hair out. my dad was controlling and my mom was clingy. he eventually became a christian after dating my mom. my mother swears she brought him to christ but really it was his friend at work. she also fully believes that even though he treats her and the rest of our family like shit, it was her purpose to bring him to god, which again she didn’t. so she failed at that too. my mom does way too much for him and my dad is still controlling and lowkey couldnt give a shit about her. they are both still unfortunately christian. 

back to my birth, because of all the complications of my birth my mom believes that i am basically the living embodiment of christ and proof that he exists. but it was actually the insanely educated, caring genius doctors and nurses. and i am very aware that it is amazing that i am here, again thank you amazing doctors and nurses. they completely discourage the years of education and skill and say it was all because of some man in the sky. it’s very insulting actually. 

i am very thankful to be alive, but at the same time there is also this huge guilt i’ve felt since birth to believe in god. i am atheist and have been for a long time now, but they don’t know that lol. whenever i even slightly bring up not believing she cuts me off and something along the lines of “how could you? why are you here right now then? you’re lucky to even be alive”.  they are also insanely conservative, so whenever the topic of abortion comes up it’s always “i could’ve aborted you, how would you feel to not be here” also wanted to say that we’ve never even attended church officially. i only ever went to church in summer to basically be babysat and sing worship songs. church was on the tv in sundays but i never payed attention. i have been skeptical even since i was little. 

so all this shame since birth has been projected onto me by parents. everything was bad to them. sex was bad, money was bad, dragons on t shirts were bad. they were often very judgemental, wondered what people would think of me, wanted me to be “good and right”. i often fear disappointing them by living my own life that has nothing to do with the lord. i don’t feel shame from the church, but more shame from my parents. that i’m not good, that i’m a disappointment, deep sense dread, fear, guilt etc. all the bad things shame brings. does this count as religious trauma? do i belong here? does anyone know how to help? thank you all for reading. u can check my horrific post history for more backstory if u want. thank u again"

My father, his father and my mom's mom were all hoarders. My family is still dealing with storage units from my grandmother. I don't want to end up anything like them.

I've learned through my years of therapy that I carry these tendencies. I don't want to end up anything like them. I'm a college senior and moved into my freshman dorm with way too much stuff. Long story short, I've lived off campus in 2 different places before coming back to the dorms and I'm hoping to stay in my current dorm if I go to grad school here (which is very likely). I'm ready to make my dorm feel like a home.

**Now this is the advice I'm looking for-** What is the kind of headspace I can practice to say 'goodbye' to the things I don't need anymore? I've practiced sectioning my room in spots with my therapist to better handle parts one at a time. But I get so overwhelmed that my mind goes blank and I fall into a state of panic when making these piles of stuff I'm getting rid of.

I've done so many hacks to stay organized throughout my entire life. My current dorm room is a mess because it's incredibly hard for me to get rid of things I don't use anymore. I’ve also become physically disabled in the past year and a half where I get winded and tired easily. So keeping up with my room is even harder. My mom and her friend are going to help me organize my room before the start of the next semester. They are both very good at helping other people organize. So I am looking forward to the help. But I would like to know how I can keep myself calm when my anxiety picks up."

I need friends and a partner more than I was led to believe by my parents. I need nice people around me to feel happy, and I like talking to people (everyone in my family 
2. I may not ever find a husband because since I was 10 I have only ever felt sadness, and have never had a crush on anyone. 
3. I was such a warm child, but grew into a cold person because my parents were selfish. 
4. My aunt told me about how spoiled my dad was and how he was kissed everyday by his sisters and loved unconditionally, so he expected that same energy from me even though he only showed me rudeness and selfishness. 
5. My family has no clue that I have experienced anxiety my entire life, and they will always think I am a shy, intelligent girl who always has a plan (even though I had no clue what was going on in high school, chose easy college majors, and have no plan for anything). 
6. By textbook definition I was emotionally neglected by my parents, brother, cousin, and aunt (except maybe not the other one?) and have all the characteristics, but my entire family never realized and made me feel like I was doing something wrong by experiencing depression. 

Since leaving my hometown I feel like it is SO much more difficult for me to communicate? I haven't seen my friends in weeks and returned to work after a week and a half yesterday. I feel like I can't communicate. I feel like I have regressed back to my teenage self. I'm going to try to reach out to some people to see if they want to hangout, and see if I get back to normal. "

Started dating this guy and all is well, but then we went on this trip and I got over stimulated and exposed to language that makes me uncomfortable. 
This all led to me being very dysregulated, dissociating and getting triggered all in one weekend in front of the guy I just started dating. I am normally very on top of keeping myself regulated but my people pleasing and  anxious attachment got the best of me and all I could do was think about how to not make a fuss, not getting upset, not asking for any of my needs etc. which made things worse of course. 
All of the feelings of fear of abandonment, fear of rejection, fear of disappointment, guilt, fear of not being enough came to the surface. 

The guy I’m talking to is so responsive and being very understanding. Asking me what he can do to support me, how he can understand me, be aware of my dissociation and over stimulation, and more. He is doing everything a person does who cares about you and wants to be there to support you. 

Last night I got high thinking lemme relax. Wrong. He said he was going out with friends from high school, college and work and invited anyone who could come. Idky this really got to me like why didn’t he invite me. I’m looking at it today as he’s not ready to introduce me to people like that, and he knows I’m recovering from the weekend. 

This also is telling me my obsessive and jealous side is coming out because I don’t want him to go out without me. I hate the feeling of anxiety that I was having. 

I realize I really need to focus on myself right now. While he is fitting all of my wants and needs in a partner, it is still my responsibility to take care of myself. I can only be a good partner if I am stable in myself and secure. 

Goals for a few weeks: no texting. Scheduled calls. Only hangout once a week. Nice dates once a month. Sunday-Thursday is for myself no exceptions."

I was born and raised in South Texas and it snowed for the first time in like 90 years or something like that when I was 12 years old. I had always dreamed about my first snow experience growing up. I wanted to build a snowman and throw snowballs cause it looked like so much fun seeing it in movies. 

Well my parents, siblings, and I went to go stay on my aunt and uncles farm for a weekend to BBQ and so my dad could go deer hunting with my uncle. Well it was a huge surprise when it started snowing. I was so excited! My cousin's, siblings, parents, and and uncle all got their shoes and jackets on to go outside and play in it. As I started getting my shoes and jacket on, my evil step mother told me I had to stay in the house and wasn't allowed to go out and play in the snow until everyone else was done and back inside the house. So I sat at the window watching everyone play in the snow and having so much fun. Then when everyone came in she said I could go out there and play by myself. It was night time too. So I went out there and I cried the entire time I built a snowman by myself. It destroyed me and my heart was just broken beyond repair, that was the last straw for me mentally cause she would do shit like that to me all the time. That was when I started self harming. 

After I went no contact at the age of 17, I decided I would leave texas for good some day. At 24 years old, I finally was able to leave Texas and moved to Nebraska. And of course it snows here every winter. And it's so beautiful and I love seeing the snow. Im 32 now and have not been able to get myself to play in the snow even though I so badly still want to as an adult but everytime I think I might go build a snowman or something, I end up crying hard and just can't get myself to go out and enjoy the snow cause my heart is still broken for my child self. It kills me that she ruined what could have been a great memory as a child. Im so fucking sad and just want to hug child me and tell her it's okay. I try to do that now in a way but it just doesn't help :("

I’ve never felt so paralyzed with a decision and terrified to act in my entire life and it feels so difficult to get people to understand. I can’t tell you what happened two years ago at my first apartment, but I was under lots of stress, things kept happening peneing and I kept thinking my feelings were wrong and needed to be controlled. It was all so much, so many events, trying to get work done, so much stuff. I found when we moved from that apartment I just. I felt absolutely nothing. The harm was gone but I was just a shell. Then more events started piling up again. More and more and I made a misstep and moved when I shouldn’t have. Now here I am again feeling my feelings, but it’s just triggers on and on in a new apartment that I can’t be in without all my alarms going off. I want to move so bad, there’s a place right next to my school, it would work I could actually get things done. Am I running away again? My parents took me home after a particularly bad anxiety attack and I should be going back on Monday but I just cannot make a decision for the entire life of me. I’m so stuck and I need to decide how to sublet my room (it’s a bit complicated my roommates are agreeing that I can sublet if the mice are gone but they’re mice and we’ve done all we can but they won’t just go away) or I figure out how to stay in an apartment that’s two hours away from my school with roommates I’ve tried to communicate with but have been showed that they are deflective and do not want to find solutions, only ‘win’ conflicts. My next semester starts January 17th. 

What do you do when you just. Don’t know? Every answer is terrifying. The idea of even stepping in my apartment sets my entire body off, it’s not a no maybe, it’s an absolute I do not want to go in there. I barely remember what happened at my first apartment, but the last two years have affected me in such a way, I’ve put off my needs for so long, that I’m sitting here. Missing my friends who I moved away from, getting takes from my partner, parents, and friends all voicing different opinions. 

I have no idea I’m so terrified, I’m so terrified and my roommates aren’t particularly bad bad, but just like mean girls who have been exceedingly difficult to communicate with. The expectations they have that I cannot work into my schedule because the place is two hours away from my school. I just want to get out I need to get out i can’t please everyone. I’m in college full time, I work while In school, and I’m in art school and we have very very large projects. I’ve been under stress and receiving the consequences for that stress and it’s peaking to a point where I feel like I can’t make decisions and thinking about the situation and what the right decision has kept me in a constant state of fight or flight. 

I have a consultation for a therapist on Monday but I have some insurance stuff to work out. Something has just been happening to me for putting off myself and my needs and now that I’ve started these antidepressants and feeling my emotions, I’m feeling the consequences I think. Because off them I just didn’t care, I was just tired and on edge but I couldn’t care about anything more than the bare minimum. 

Has anyone else had such a big decision to make and have just been so terrified of everything?

I have no idea what I’m supposed to do or think or feel

CPTSD,Tips for Guilt and Shame Around Saying “No” When Dating?,18zlpxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zlpxb/tips_for_guilt_and_shame_around_saying_no_when/,https://www.reddit.com/user/BetterThan40,BetterThan40,2024-01-05 23:58:58,Tips for Guilt and Shame Around Saying “No” When Dating?,"Hey all! I (25F) am recovering from some sex-related adolescent psychological abuse, a CSA, and two assaults in college. One of my biggest hurdles has been shame spiraling any time I have to say no to a man I pity and the toxic shame spiral that follows when I succeed.
 
I’ve gotten better recently and I know exposure therapy and continuing to date is the solution, but I’m still pretty early in figuring out how. Figured I would ask you all what strategies you use.
 
Optional Read: here are some examples of where I’m at:
 
•  had heart palpitations and disassociation after having to cancel a second date tonight, shame spiraled about having led him on and caught him off guard by being too nice despite not being physically attracted to him
 
• considered it a big victory that I didn’t sleep with him after said date
 
• considered it a big victory when a male friend who seemed interested in me but never made a move had to crash on my couch and I didn’t initiate sleeping with him
 
• friends jokingly refer to it as the “[My Name] Thing” when they just sleep with someone because it’s easier than saying no and going home or asking them to go home
 
• I have never managed to go back to a date’s house without sleeping with them, even though I usually don’t want to, I just feel obliged ESPECIALLY if they pay
 
• I spend money I don’t have on paying for dates so I feel less pressure to sleep with them but usually do anyway
 
• Was broken up with early last month for the first time and my brain short circuited because I didn’t know how to identify my feelings, so I just filled my head up with his. I ended up thanking him twice, repeatedly expressing pity for him at having to break up with me and paying for his drinks"
CPTSD,Can you discipline yourself out of CPTSD/PTSD triggers? Trigger warning and Venting,18zlm90,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zlm90/can_you_discipline_yourself_out_of_cptsdptsd/,https://www.reddit.com/user/chimkems,chimkems,2024-01-05 23:54:31,Can you discipline yourself out of CPTSD/PTSD triggers? Trigger warning and Venting,"My psychologist told me that I should ""practice more discipline in catching myself when triggering or upsetting thoughts arise.""

I had asked for help in managing or eliminating seemingly uncontrollable memories and rumination when something similar to what my abusers did is presented to me.

It didn't leave a good impression on me and I thought she should have better advice than this, considering she knows the details of my past. I initially gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed that she may have meant using the concept of compartmentalization to help me with dealing with triggers or grounding techniques to keep myself calm and avoid spiralling and self harm, but really, I suggested those.

I'm open to the idea of adopting more discipline into my life. Just tell me how and what do I need to do. But let's be honest, I could get the answer to this easily by googling it. What I'm starved of is personalized actionable advice.

I could go on and on about how I was a parentified child, a makeshift mother and caretaker to my siblings and a partner and personal assistant to my parent but that won't mean anything to show that I have enough discipline. I feel as though she has given me this advice because they have painted me as some basement dwelling idiot living rent free, ignoring that I'm paying my own and helping my family with the costs. All because I didn't complete high school even though I had my own reasons (Assaulted during my first attempt at Uni qualifying exams, assaulted again at second attempt, mix that with an abusive and neglectful upbringing, no one believing me and a little CSA and SA. I ended up mentally crumbling, giving up and working dead end jobs so I can at least save and support the family). Yes I have a chip on my shoulder lol.

Professional help has me feeling jaded. I feel as though I'm better equipped to handle it all on my own. No attempts of diagnoses, no attempts of helpful programmes. I started self directed CBT/DBT/EMDR and Internal Family Systems via journaling myself because they were passing me around like a hot potato and have called the past three months ""progress"". Each appointment is just unactionable advice on top of unactionable advice. ""Have some hope"" is the best and most hilarious one so far.

I have lost interest in getting professional help. I've gone through therapists in the past and I could excuse them for their inability to deal with my issues, but I can't do that to a team of psychiatrists and psychologists. I can't give them grace or the benefit of the doubt, which makes me feel hopeless.

This isn't even the only instance of shady or possibly incompetent events happening here, I'll save it though and keep my mouth shut for my privacy.

What's the verdict? Should I shut up and just keep going? Stop complaining? Am I even right to be upset or is it just my ego clouding my perception of everything? I don't even know what I'm asking anymore lol, reply ""L"" in the comments if you feel my pain xD

Cheerio

CPTSD,What's real and what's trauma reaction,18zlhsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zlhsg/whats_real_and_whats_trauma_reaction/,https://www.reddit.com/user/420medicineman,420medicineman,2024-01-05 23:49:23,What's real and what's trauma reaction,"Any good tips on how to tell what thoughts/ideas you have are actually the way you think/feel, and which ones are simply trauma reactions?  I've been married 12 years now and have been finding myself triggered nearly constantly.  It's to the point where I'm considering leaving because it's just so much work and I'm so tired of constantly fighting not only the normal battles and challenges everyone faces in marriage, plus the extra strong reactions to some of the stuff as a result of my PTSD (feeling constantly watched and criticized, feeling I'm not enough/not good enough.)  We've been in counseling for years and yet it still seems to be a struggle.   


Lately I've been fantasizing a lot about splitting up so I can live a much simpler life where I don't have to feel constantly triggered.  At the same time, I've always had the coping mechanism of ""disappearing"" or ""going away"" when under stress.  My pre-marriage life fantasy was buying a sailboat and simply spending my whole life drifting around.    


So, how do you differentiate when you're really unhappy with  situation and when you're just reacting from your trauma?"

I moved to the US less than 3 years ago, and began my journey with cptsd only a year ago. This also coincided with me completing grad school and moving to west coast, ending things with an extremely abusive ex. 

I haven’t returned home since I first came, and the last year especially has been incredibly isolating. Moreover, every time I try to give people a chance, I feel let down and this feeds into my depression and pessimism.


I’m not doing bad, per se, I have a cat, hobbies, no big financial issues. But I crave some genuine human connection and I’m not sure how to get that. I also find myself lost, without an identity here. ( everyone who lives in my area are Asians in tech, like me  )

In the rare occasions when someone is nice, I freeze up, I don’t know how to move the friendship forward ( I am unable to convince myself they’d like me forward real ) and when something is planned, I often am too depressed to show up.


How to find myself? How to find friends? How to feel more alive?"

I purposely decided to get emotionally attached to a celebrity. It was a safe plan. I assumed she'd be like most of them - shallow and stupid. But no. I found out she's the most lovely human being I've ever seen and we also have the same interests, the same personality.

I never had any expectations. I know she'd never acknowledge my existence. I know she'll never know my name or develop the slighest interest in me. But I loved the fantasies I had in my head every night before falling asleep. An alternate reality where all my dreams came true and she's my partner, professionally and romantically.

Today I found out she's getting married and I'm wrecked. It feels like the day of my most traumatic romantic rejection all over again. I feel abandoned all over again. I feel like I really lost something. I feel sick to my stomach. I feel dizzy. I can't even breathe. I just wanted to rip my heart off so I never feel anything at all again.

Please, somebody help me. This fantasy was the only thing that was keeping my sanity. I know I'll never find a romantic partner because of my deformed face and my mental illness. Just say something nice. Just say something to make it stop."
CPTSD,was it all in my head the whole time?,18zkkag,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zkkag/was_it_all_in_my_head_the_whole_time/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Same-Owl-5811,Same-Owl-5811,2024-01-05 23:10:27,was it all in my head the whole time?,"im gonna try not to make this too long. basically a few years ago i posted in an ED subreddit about how i couldnt exercise because i would think of my sister and mother teasing me about not exercising and start crying everytime out of shame and gender dysphoria. someone commented telling me about cptsd, and at first i was like Lol no, that's for people who went through real bad shit. but i checked it out anyways...and my eyes were slowly opened. i ticked nearly every single bullet on the list of cptsd traits. i think the main thing was emotional neglect.

anyways, i moved out as soon as i could, and i now live with my boyfriend (im 19). and im in college. it's absolutely wonderful, but whenever it's time to go back for the holidays, ill get really anxious and cry a lot in the days leading up to the trip ""home"". but especially this year, not much really happens anymore. my mom and sisters relationship with each other is so much better than it used to be, which was like daily screaming fights. my mom and dad should definitely be divorced, but it seems like my mom has matured an insane amount in the past couple years alone. we used to spend every single conversation talking about my sisters drug and alcohol abuse, or something else of a similar emotional burden, and i would bear the weight. i would talk her through it. i was there when she said she must have been a serial killer in her past life to deserve what my sister was putting her through...to her own child. i wasn't the easiest child, especially because i transitioned to male when i was 13, but god fucking damnit did i try to be easy. i made myself a breeze to deal with. i never told any of them anything. my mom i think suspects i had an ED, and she read my journal when i was 13 where i talked about wanting to die, but whenever she brings that stuff up now, all she says is ""you somehow figured that all out on your own"". 

im getting off track. but basically my parents, especially my mom (my dad has narcissistic traits and is kind of an alcoholic and no matter how much i try to tell my mom she deserves better treatment she doesn't listen to me and tells me at least he doesn't beat the shit out of me, something i heard a lot growing up) are much, much better and it no longer makes my heart sink to my feet when im with them. most of the time im happy to spend time with my mom, shes really funny and personable and chaotic. she also has really severe ADHD that was undiagnosed until last year, so i feel like that's part of it. she has matured immensely and while i am proud and happy for her, there's this aching void in my chest. i feel like i must have faked all of it. i was venting to my boyfriend about it the other night, sobbing relentlessly, and i asked him if i was being oversensitive and making all of it up. i asked him this because everytime i would tell a story about something that hurt my feelings aloud, it would dawn on me how stupid i was for getting hurt over it. he told me that as singular incidents, then maybe i would be being oversensitive, but compounded together over time it's hurtful. this kinda sent me spiralling even though i agree with him. 

im just so scared to be wrong. what if ive been oversensitive all these years? sure i isolated myself an insane amount, to the point that now i don't really know how to be a person, but in the end that was all my doing. sure, my mom and especially my dad are not the most emotionally reliable people, but if i really needed help i couldve gotten it. the issue was i didnt want help. i wanted to be left alone, but also i was literally 11 years old and its not my fault that therapist sucked and my mom didnt believe me when i told her so.

i just wish it was black and white so that i could have a proper statement, but things never are. ever since i was a kid i would fantasize about getting beaten up so that i could have something physical to prove my pain with. when i tell my boyfriend this he doesn't understand...i don't know. i still feel so hurt and sensitive all the time, although i think im getting better. i used to cry all the time when my boyfriend would accidentally say something with a slightly harsh tone, but i feel myself slowly understanding how normal people act with each other.

this isn't to say that my family is totally fine now, it's just....better. and i worry that i was just crying over it so i could feel bad for myself the whole time. idk. i know this is a common feeling but genuinely i had it so good, had everything i could want in terms of physical items....i feel like im the exception to the ""lots of traumatized people feel like theyre faking it"" thing. i fear it. i just hate that im STILL like this and theyre fucking Fine. i feel like i really need to get over it, but i cant. i wish they were worse so that at least my boyfriend might be able to understand me. but no one will ever understand me completely. sometimes that fact is what hurts the most. 

edit: i do not understand downvoting this i am sorry did i say anything wrong?? im just looking for support idk "
CPTSD,Trouble accepting it is trauma instead of 'just' anxiety,18zkey4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18zkey4/trouble_accepting_it_is_trauma_instead_of_just/,https://www.reddit.com/user/ginx_minx,ginx_minx,2024-01-05 23:04:05,Trouble accepting it is trauma instead of 'just' anxiety,"Hi all! I've been struggling for years with sudden feelings of extreme anxiety when going places/seeing people but could never say what made me scared. It's been 7 years and although it has been making my life very hard I still couldn't name what it is that makes me scared. Which scares me more because I feel absolutely crazy for being scared at 'nothing'. I've been in therapy for anxiety for years and it hasn't made a difference other than that I now feel I am an anxious person. I identify with it as my core problem.

Since I wasn't making any progress whatsoever a friend of mine kept hammering me to read up on trauma, which I figured was useless since no way. I eventually gave in and read a lot of books like The Body Keeps the Score. It's been about a year and I now know I have trauma. Yet I can't feel it. It still feels like no, you have an anxiety disorder.

I've lived with a suicidal dad and a sick mom for years, so I know rationally it is probably true. But I just can't allow myself to say these anxiety feelings that have been ruining my life are due to trauma. That they are probably emotions due to being triggered. Yet I can't allow myself to say it's okay you are being triggered since in a way I'm like no it's just anxiety because you are a pussy. Since I am so used to living with anxiety as being my biggest flaw. Do any of you have tips for this?"

Please help my autistic self understand.

I hear things like ""think of X word...what feelings come up?"" Or ""what do you feel looking at this image?"" And it's like, an image of 2 lions cuddling. What comes up? Do people really have feelings while looking at the lion image? Am I that dead?

Or the fact that people get triggered by tv series...for me it's just, it's a series, I watch it to distract myself - *maybe* maybe if someone dies, I'll be sad. 

Also the anger. People have so much anger for small things. Where do they find all that energy?

Maybe I am missing out on the entire human experience

I spent almost a year living in a different town, still paying for my apartment in my home town and paying all the expenses at her house where I was working (unpaid) and I moved my daughter down with me but the school was so racist that she and my husband moved back to our home town… 

I completely emptied her house and worked on it 7 days a week including fixing it up so fixing the Sheetrock in the basement my brother had broken, installing the flooring, finishing the heating vent system, finishing the walls, building a second bathrooms, re-doing old tile, and doing tons of landscaping work. I added 80-100,000 in value to that house and when I was done I moved back to my home town… she went down there to pick up the rest of her stuff that I had packed up down there and you know what she did… she complained that I forgot a pair of jeans there. 

She was always hyper critical so she started laying into me about how I have no respect for things and had left the house “trashed” And all that and I finally said “are you kidding me? I gave up a year of my life and worked my ass off for you!” That was the first time I ever talked back or spoke up for myself against her and I was 36. 

The work was great (my father taught me well and he and I used to work together on projects) so she never complained about that except color choices but my god those jeans here as if I had pooped in the middle of the floor."

Thanks for paying attention to the warning!


My boyfriend of more than a year, who has CPTSD, is really my everything; he’s the sweetest, most awsome human being I’ve hever met. We both make active constant efforts in order to keep our relationship healthy and happy. This involves a lot of honesty, so, naturally, we’ve told each other about our pasts. His includes a lot of terrible abuse, which he, and no one, would ever deserve. I completely accept and understand the trauma he’s gone through so I try to be as supportive as I can: I make sure to do constant research on CPTSD and communicate with him about the struggles he goes through because of it.

However, sometimes knowing all that he’s been through really gets to me, which I guess is normal, but still hurts like hell. Whenever this happens I tell myself it’s okay because he won’t ever be put in any similar situation again, he now knows how to identify abuse, unhealthy dynamics and how to get away from them, etc. And most importantly, he now has a support net, me, his parents, and his friends, who can and will help him in case he’s ever in danger. Usually repeating this to myself helps, but sometimes there doesn’t seem to be anything to help me make it hurt less. He’s a wonderful person, he’s always been, and he doesn’t deserve all what happened to him, not even one thing. Sometimes I wish it all happened to me instead, other times I feel guilty I didn’t know him back when he was going through all that abuse so that I could help him somehow, which I’m aware is a completely irrational thought, which and I feel kind of selfish for having, but that’s besides the point.

I know I have to bring all this up to him and I will, eventually. It’s just that I can’t help to feel like I’m framing myself as the victim when really he’s the one who had to endure all that for literal years and who now has to cope with hurtful symptoms everyday. My questions are: is there anyone in this subreddit who’s gone through something similar? How can I deal with this feelings? And lastly, for people with CPTSD, how would you feel if your partner brought this up to you?

I'm 35 in a few short weeks and I'm fighting off the urge to despair every day that my dating life is....almost nothing. A single sexual partner that I met on Bumble and I couldn't get it up for her because porn ruined my dick, having used it as a substitute for the female affection I never thought I'd ever receive in life.

Watching my friends date and fuck and hook up at parties and clubs like it's normal gives me nothing but despair, depressed at the thought that I never had a dating or sex life in my youth.

I'm at the point in my therapy where I finally feel like I could possibly live free from all the protective behaviours that have made me so miserable but I don't know where to start or even think about how to overcome the hurdle of having zero experience in anything. I feel like the only thing that will fix me is a time machine that will take me back to being 18, tell myself to lose some fucking weight and get sleeping around.

I still want that sleeping around phase that I never had, but I'm at the age where everyone settles down and I don't want to miss out on the joy of exploitative sex, casual or not.

How do I reconcile this? Is there a chance for me to still be a manslut for a few years or even get into a normal dating routine at my age for the first time? OLD is a miserable dead end for someone not particularly photogenic like me (bit I don't think I'm ugly, still need to lose that weight tho).

So basically if I’m overwhelmed with problems, I feel like I just “should” be okay and I don’t ask for comfort/support from others. Then that leads to me getting more fucked up and then needing even more comfort but still being fucked up etc etc

So to solve this, the minute I identify that I’m having a hard time I need to acknowledge I need comfort and seek it out. So I decided I will reach out to support system when that happens?

What I’d need in those times would be reassurance that I’m a smart and capable human being and I’m not my trauma and that I’ll get through this. Basically timely reminders of this so that I know what’s the true reality. 

It’s almost unreal how realising this took me years and can help make my life so much better?"

I didn't have a good childhood. My mother mentally terrorised me since early childhood and my father never helped me even though he had promised so many times. So for my own mental health that was quickly deteriorating at that point because of them I told them I needed a break and went no contact for a year. When I felt more stable I reached out to them and we talked about some of the things but not all of them because my mother tends to ""not remember"" what she said or did. 

For 12 years now I've been trying to work on a good relationship with them and even helped them in any way I could. Every now and then my mother would go back to her old habbit of yelling at me what a bad person I am and that I never helped them. I know it isn't true and most of the time she admits what a wonderful person I am for being there for them.

A couple of months ago they decided to move into the area I live in as I had asked them to so I could be there for them when they get older (my mother just retired). Since they're hete I do everything possible to make them feel at home and even inviting them to meet my friends so they can socialise (my mother didn't have friends for many years).

Recently I was going shopping with her and all of a sudden she pointed out that she was reluctant to move here because she can't be sure if I wouldn't let them down again and go no contact like once before. I was stunned and my anxiety level went up. She then said, she still doesn't think it was necessary at that time to go no contact and how much she had to suffer because of it.

I now feel like she actually didn't understand anything back then and I'm still the bad, selfish person to her. I can't back out now, they already moved here. But now it feels like a lot of pressure. I think she expects me to deal with all of her tantrums from now on. I'm feeling like that little cornered girl again, sitting in the corner of my room and getting yelled at for no reason.

Really had to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading this and maybe someone has a similar story?"

This is 2 hrs worth of a tired dipshit writing about his shitty life and its not even all all of it and it has alot of shit humour and no grammar to be seen so read at your own risk or with alcoholic popcorn



Im in a relatively stable part in my life now so i thought it be best to tell my story and hey maybe someone will see all the shit i went through and feel maybe shits gonna turn out alright for them


Also im on mobile so the formatting will be garbage 


Alright so i guess the most logical start would be the literal beginning but my trouble kinda start even before i breach and cleared into a doctors hands, both of my parents had really really fucked lives that fucked them up a hell of alot 

My mom (and uncle) grew up being raped almost constantly by my grandmother's churchfriend's children when she was 5 up until around 6.5 maybe longer by boys that were (4-17) i cannot remember exact details as ive only really heard my mothers rare drunken ramblings and things id hear from her venting to either my father or me 

She also had to go through her parents having a divorce and not being able to actually get justice (till much much later in life) 


Now for my dad

My dad grew up with a complete abusive fuckhead of a dad and a schizophrenic mother  
He has told me many times that he didn't really feel like he had parents as he was fully independent at 5 (not by choice but by neglect) and rarely interacted with him outside  of abuse and he basically barely had any positive memories of them at all 

He even told me that as soon as he had enough mpney to move out he did and his parents would call asking for money and show up unannounced to ask for things like cigarettes or gas.



I know very little about my parents early relationship besides of starting from boinking for cigarettes and my mother cheating quite a bit (and also the fact that my parents thought lube was optional with anal but thats not really realated its just something that keeps me awake at night)




When my parents were around 18 they had my  brother Bread (its funny if you are me) and he turned out to be lvl3 in the autism skill tree and as incredibly unprepared uneducated and underfunded and often mentally unstable parents  dealing with a vastly misunderstood and often difficult mental mixup youd assume my parents would be royally fucked, but neverfear my dads incredible productive and extremely self distrutive ass is here as he work at somestime like 5 jobs up to 90+ hrs to support them all and pay off their depts from all the support and medical shit my brother needed which was damn expensive even playing the aboriginal card (im Australian).

But now a bit about bread he is a fucking absolutely prick and was extremely abusive to me from the  time i was born until maybe 2 years ago (mainly because i can kick his ass now but still hes improving), he has done numerous ludicrous things to me (nothing sexual dont worry my trauma aint go there)
Hes stuffed me into one of those toychest couches  and sat on it as i slowly suffocated while i screamed for help and tried to claw my way out with frail fingers

 (we were in a shrinks waiting room for my brother and my parents were talking to him in his office and unfortunately his office was  a thick wall away from the waiting room so my parents couldn't hear me) 

Fun fact the receptionist apparently saw a child being suffocated and didn't intervene so fuck her lol

Anyway after 500 damn words lets get to me, ya boy, ya star, the main attraction, razzmatazz to ya sadness 

When i was born it made my parents life exceptionally difficult as they basically had 3 kids with the amount of extra care my brother needed so they were basically running themselves to a thread so they took me to stay with my nan most of the time when i was growing up so they could both work and my mom could study

Growing up in my home i could tell that my parents were most of the time hanging on to threads in their sanity so i would do my damn best to be the best damn kid i could be

Buut to my child brain that just meant inconveniencing them only when there was absolutely no other way to get what i needed and hell sometimes i would starve myself for a day just so my parents wouldn't have to go out and buy me food as i knew money was always hella tight which what do you know lead to a fun little eating disorder 

As i said my brother was a complete asshat and led me to feel shit about basically everything about myself and feel worhtless and suicidal at around 5 and boy did that stunt my emotional growth

Now lets get to the fun stuff and talk about my school years





Ahhhh kindergarten, the land of glitter and glue and unfortunately for the town i grew up in booger sugar and iced lattes but instead of  latte it was children and instead of the normal use of the word ice it was the Australian one

My kindergarten years were a complete fucking blur but i remember seeing a girl i had a crush on bleeding from her pants (my innocent ass brought her the box of bandaids) and one of my class mates suddenly and without warning never showing up to school again and i had to go to this fun thing at a church that had a lamination filled table so i didn't really listen to what was going on

My nan tried to take to church alot more after all that stuff but damn was i always the first to jump outta my seat an barrel towards that baked heaven so much so that  i learnt most of my persuasive abilitys jsut trying to convince the nice old lady that baked them that i should just eat all of them because i was..... there

Then we get into prep with was relatively uneventful putside of a bomb scare and a couple kids popping up with bruises. But i did notice alot more of my friends didn't  wana hang out with me and they wouldn't tell me why and curiously it was only the ones that were aboriginal and darker skin then me (no im not doing a racism i get to what im yapping sbout)


Fun note around this time i lost sight in my left eye thanks to my idiot brother but i wont say how as its hella identifiable





Year 1 shit hit the fan at my home life with my parents separated and my brother being expelled from his first skill near the start of the year with him joining the school i was at which made the bullying which was only minor up until that point get exponentially worse and so did the rascism and euginism?? Idk what to call it

(Small context)
Aboriginals in Australia were basically raped through generations to make  a generation of ""white enough "" aboriginals to be place into white families and ""rehabilitated"" and thats led to a smallish section of aboriginal people seeing a mixed race aboriginal child *especially a white passing one* as  basically satan to the point they basically hated me more then just white people which most of them also hated


But year i had tk deal with alot of shit but it all went to an extreme one day when me and my brother were waiting for a friends mom to come pick us up when a group of aboriginal boys spotted us and one of them jumped on my brothers back a kneed his spine from behind


My brother even at this time was very tall fir his age (about 14ish and 6ft+) and only some of the older boy matched him in height but it would take about 3 of em to macth him in weight (no idea of weight around 150kg) he was a silent giant at school due to being constantly bullied and the like and  all he could do was stand there and say ""leave me alone"" in the Weakest voice ive ever seen from him and i watch them all spew every fucking insult they could think of ""white spastic ni&&a""etc

Then one through a full can of coke at his head and he started to bleed but still stood there as they tild him to ""drink up fat boy"" as the can busted hitting the curb anx spraying him and when i looked at my brother i saw him crying.


I saw the person i feared so much that i never stood withen arms reach fucking crying 

But i didn't feel any fucking catharsis or relief all i felt was a fuck tonne of anger to the point where i was about pass out and all i could get put was just vauge fucking warcries of just pleading/demanding they stop but all they did was juat fucking stare and one threw his water bottle at me and missed so i ditched it at his fucking head as hard as i could and then they all just rushed me and where clearly going to beat me if not outright kill me  but my brother just tackled the front one with a fucking thud

I cannot emphasise enough that these were lean fucking football and rugby players being tackled by what was essentially a double bass shaped frieght train made of fat and muscle from carrying said fat  

So these kids were sent actually flying and others that sat there stunned for a bit dogpiled and kicked the shit outta my brother as my toned 7 yo legs from fighting my brother who weighs 150 kg was kicking them each so hard in the nuts id swear i broke a toe on their pelvises 

The fighting continued for about 3 mins and ended with me being half conscious from being hit in the face by someone twice my size and my brother bleeding  a noticeable amount and the fighting only stopped because the principle had spotted us because we were in basically the front entrance

He called us up and called our mom who had to rush from work after being told we started a foght only to find her 2 sons bleeding in the waiting room being screamed at by a old (and very very racist) man and she saw in the nect room a nurse attending to what looked like a platoon of  idiots all holding their balls and  broken.... everything (150kg) and then stopping as the principal goes to demand that she punish us and she just unleashes all of her customers service worker and latina mama bear rage on this sack of shit so loud it probably brought me back to conciousness 
And she called the police to press charges on the boys and when she came back in the principle explained that my brother and i were suspended and my brother could no longer attend his senior camp trip (my mom paid 100 just because my brother wanted tl go to it just to not be at home due to my parents fighting and they made it happen

My mom asked fir the deposit back

Principal said he spent it

Long story short my mom had my uncles lawyer send a very legally threatening letter and suddenly 100 dollers suddenly appeared 






Alright i would continue but im very tired and its 7 and i havent slept and my bf is waking up so ima leave it here for now

Idk if i will continue but if people actually read this incoherent word vomit about an internet stranger then hell maybe i will

Thank you for anyone thats actually read this far and if you have any questions or anything you can comment or dm me and ill most likely answer them"

In this process, the survivor seeks assistance not only from those closest to her, but also from the wider community. The response of the community has a powerful influence on the ultimate resolution of the trauma. Restoration of the breach between the traumatized person and the community depends, first, upon public acknowledgment of the traumatic event and, second, upon some form of community action. Once it is publicly recognized that a person has been harmed, the community must take action to assign responsibility for the harm and to repair the injury.

I'm a mess..and was doing so well. Or as well as one can be with our kind of histories.,"I feel like I'm losing it. I'm even afraid to tell my therapist who I trust without a doubt about how I feel. And she had helped me immensely. Yet suddenly i am scared. 

My abuser of 14 years was my biological father. Our history like all stories is a complicated one, the only constant was the abuse (sexual). 

After many attempts to speak up, finally I truly spoke up and there was an investigation etc, etc. After 3 months he ( a school teacher) was arrested and there was a trial- teatifying broke me at 17. He went away for 13 years. 
Long atory short,  I went through a lot while he what I was made aware, also auffered as a pedophile in a state prison. 

I have been doing well the past 8 years give or take. Last year he died suddenly of stomach cancer. Alone, with no one. Until his last few days he was a full believer in Thoreau's belief that ""Men lead lives of quiet desperation "" and had always hoped to ""die alone in a cabin in the woods of upstate NY"" (he was a big climber and dollhouse maker).

Ok so ..basically I for some effed up readon feel like he's in sone way trying to punish or get to me onr last time. Even in prison he wrote me convoluted ""love"" poems. (Now many years prior).  He was an English professor who I admired with such fascination. I also now have my MBA in it as well. (So fucked up?) 

 But not I am actually sick, diagnosed, yada yada. 

Does it have to do with him or am I allowing my conscious or unconscious thoughts infiltrate my reality due to the still fear of him? 

Sorry this was a long rant. But i feel crazy. I know im not but the feelings are so intense..and a therapist who hasnt experiended trauma...they dont understand to tge extent we do."

I'm F, mid 40's. My mother left when I was two. My father raise me until I left home at age 19. He was incredibly emotionally and mentally abusive. Yelling, screaming, smashing the mirrors off his truck, very angry man. Punishments of standing in the corner for entire weekends, forced to eat my vomit. There is so much more.

Now, to my question. I have a 19 year old son who literally loses his actual shit when playing video games. He yells, screams, throws things around he gets so mad. He knows it gives me anxiety and why- it brings me back to trauma of my childhood with my father. He knows, yet he does it everytime he plays video games even when me and my husband have told him if he can't control himself he needs to stop playing.

Is what my son is doing also a form of emotional abuse? It's annoying to my husband, but effects me in a much different way where I need to either leave the house or blast music and cry.

I appreciate your thoughts, thank you."

Every single time someone who is a racial minority, queer, or physically disabled speaks about their experiences in this community, they are shut down and forced to face more of it. The worst part is the mods have done nothing to actually deal with it from what I can tell.

I understand that this sub is most likely majority white, non-queer, people who aren’t physically disabled, and etc but it’s still frustrating. People are so uncomfortable discussing intersectionality, privilege, and race here that they’d prefer to just chase minorities out. This is a problem and it needs to stop. The mods need to step up too. Y’all need to be stricter and harsher with enforcing this stuff because you are isolating a large section of this community.

It is hugely triggering. Being a minority is a lived experience that is full of trauma from the day you are born. You can not exist as one without having it. I have seen so many people have to delete their posts and try to defend themselves against bigoted abuse here because they thought they could safely talk about their feelings and trauma. They can’t though. A lot of people here need to sit on their discomfort that is brought up when a minority talks about what it is like and how traumatizing it can be and do actual self reflection before responding. We are all traumatized and struggling here. We do not need to further harass, traumatize, and abuse PoC, queer people (especially trans people bc some of y’all really don’t like them here), physically disabled folks, people with pd’s, and more. Be nicer y’all. I’m gonna take a break from the internet now because I did not want to start my day this way

EDIT: Some of you need to relax when it comes to personality disorders in the comments. You shouldn't be discriminating against them under a post explicitly about bigotry and discrimination being a problem here. Do better. Not everyone with a personality disorder is bad. Statistically, they are more likely to be victims of violence and abuse than abuse others. It's a stereotype. I know a lot of you are hurting because of someone who had one.

The score of the test which was 85/100 (extreme toxicity) sunk in for a bit. Yes, it was THAT BAD. And I though that ACE score of 3 wasn't really that terrible..."

Shame is what keeps us from expressing our emotions fully when we need to. Children are raised from shame, society is built on shame. It’s all shame!!! I am so sick of it. Trauma is the disconnection from our true authentic selves- and why can’t we express our true selves? Due to shame!!! All humans are more or less traumatized, we all numb through different types of distractions and addictions. Why did our parents treat us badly? Or why couldn’t anyone hold space for us after a horrible event? Because of shame, because how they were raised by their parents and the parents before them. If we want to end the trauma cycle and heal we need to end the shame cycles of society. How?? I don’t freakin know. But for starters, don’t bring on more shame onto others and don’t accept it from anyone. Tell yourself ”I accept you, all of you” a million times a day. Just needed to say it."

I've always felt that I had some type of arrested development throughout my growing up years. Even now even through I'm almost 30 I've never loved anyone. I don't think. I don't even know what it is.

For the longest time, the biggest tragedy in my life was that I felt I couldn't experience romantic love. It hadn't happened for almost 30 years. Why now?

Last year January was the first time I saw that a few people were interested in me romantically. I couldn't accept that and they ended very badly as expected before they even began.

Just a couple of weeks ago a guy asked me out for an exclusive relationship after talking, meeting for months - to which I said yes. Now he's being very loving, understanding and expressive but I just get very uncomfortable with that. 

He says he misses me? I don't miss him. I feel like I don't know him enough to miss him. I like spending time with him once a week and I like texting him. But I don't know if I miss him? I feel like he likes me more than I like him. Which is great.

But I feel like there's something within me that I need to resolve so that I can accept his love/care. I don't know what to call it. I feel like I'll want to take this relationship at a snail's pace because I don't think I'll be able to give him what he wants. 

I don't know why I'm feeling so distant from him even though he's right now the only one I have (besides family). No friends no social circle. And he's not pushy either. 

I am already in therapy. Regular talk therapy. It's great for venting but not for solutions.

TDLR: Anyone else who's struggled with accepting romantic love and found some way to get past this issue?"

he was about to give me such a sweet gift, a film roll of the photos we'd taken at a nature reserve earlier that day. i crushed him under my heel, it felt like, even if it hurt me too. 

then i found out i'd contracted syphilis. i'd been having unsafe sex before, during and after talking to this guy, and i lied to him about it. i've never been more guilty about anything in my life than that. i wasn't honest much then.

i sent a letter explaining the situation. to my surprise, he actually replied. and we talked, got back in touch, met again. and it fell through, again. i didn't understand, i didn't know why i was so terribly caught up in how we seemed so DIFFERENT. and then i learned i had ocd on top of the cptsd. and that sent me into a terrible spiral that culminated in last night.

i'd sent a letter maybe a week ago. no response. given that we'd exchanged letters back and forth before, even and especially ones from him out of the blue, i thought it was just a matter of time. and when i couldn't wait anymore, i went out to what had been our spot to reminisce, and then decided to stop by his house to ask to talk. just to talk. 

turns out that was the most tone deaf fucking thing i could've chosen to do. i consider myself generally pretty emotionally competent, empathetic, with common sense, but i talked to his mom who he's not out to and texted him through her phone asking him to text me. what the fuck was i thinking? 

when his sister got home, the one he was closest to, who i'd met and talked to briefly before we stopped talking the last time, she acted so nice i couldn't believe it. it didn't feel right, i sensed something off, but i wanted to believe she really would pass on the message that i wanted to talk. i wanted to set things right. that i was sorry for all the hurt and confusion and commotion i'd caused but i just wanted to check in and offer myself up in all the healing i've done in the past 2 years.

instead, i drove home and got a call from her. i was exorbitantly high at the time trying to dodge the pain and it just came crashing down on me when she yelled at me to stay away and get out of his life if i really care.

i feel shattered into pieces, but worse, i feel like a fucking asshole for hurting him, *again*. she threatened to fight me if i ever showed up again. i don't blame her.

i'm just in a daze right now. i feel like i've been living in a fantasyland where i'm the only one who exists, or something. i just needed to get this off my chest. it hurts that i thought he'd understand, having cptsd too, but that's my own pain to deal with. thanks if you read this far. peace."

I am really suffering, really feel trapped, have regressed and lost skills, and what's available to me tries to get at the problem in the wrong way. So much thinking and theories and structural reforms, but I still feel lost and scared. The traditional way to deal with patients who aren't getting better is to gaslight them into thinking that they aren't really trying hard enough or, much worse, that they prefer to suffer. I have completely exhausted myself, researching psychology and philosophy and medications and modalities, but I am severely limited in what is available and what I can afford. 

There has to be another way. There **are** other ways, but I'm a Westerner in poverty with no religious history and an inability to submit my will to authority figures. There are very few avenues besides the Big Three theological camps with smatterings of Westernized philosophical traditions from other countries or New Age flimflam. There's got to be something else, but I'm too brain dead-tired to seek them out. I'm going to languish and fade away if I don't find my way out. I'm feeling a little foolish in saying that some treacly motivational video featuring Jim Carrey's words actually penetrated my brain fog somewhat, and although I am dubious about how he arrived at his supposed insights, the idea that thinking harder is not the way towards a better life is really appealing to me. 

Spirituality is almost never talked about because of the pervasiveness of the hypocrisy of the Big Three and their derivatives and of the visible charlatans of the New Age realm, but I believe that there is out there more hidden paths to 'better' that don't have a mass market presence. Spirituality has become a commodity and status symbol for so much of society that it's hard to find the places where it's practiced as a method of true transformation.  

The focus on what is wrong, the focus on the mental makeup of personality, has made me more stuck. I think what I really need is a village to live in, a community to be a part of, a place where there is a presumption of my worthiness *that doesn't come from Abrahamic religions' brownie points brainwashing*. But those kinds of places don't exist, not with prejudices and constraints. 

What I need is a framework that lets me relax and not guard, that lets me dream without limit, and to take leaps of faith knowing that I will not be destroyed. Does this exist? It has to exist!

I think I just have to find more energy and look harder, but the complexity of being a fragile looney forever complicate even the tiniest step."

There seem to be two therapy ideas:

2) substance abuse mimicks mental health conditions so we really don’t know what is going on with the brain until other substances are long out of the picture.  I.e triggering and hyper vigilance is also a hangover symptom for daily drinkers.  Or reading into micro emotions is a weed thing."

It would test the very fabric of my existence. And it did. For years, I touted that I was going to put a bullet in my head on my 40th bday because I didn't want to go over the hill. My younger brother beat me to it. At 27 he used a Desert Eagle to end his life. Four years later, mom bled out in the hospital. She'd thrown a tantrum because her son in law was not moving fast enough for her liking. The screaming caused a rupture in her throat and she drowned in her own blood. 

My brother's suicide hit me like a ton of bricks. It created a huge sense of urgency inside me to find protection from the rest of my family. I knew it wouldn't take much to shatter the fragile dynamic inside my family unit. One of us kids killing themselves was overkill 9000. I knew my mother was on a timer and she'd be dead soon as well. Her trail of destruction on her way out was something to behold. My father enabled her the entire way. Buying her wine, giving her his pills, paying for her lawyers, covering her tracks. My sister did the same as much as she could.

So when 40 came and it was time to shoot myself (according to my own time line) I couldn't do it. I'd already lost everything and survived. Surviving was all I'd done, and I didn't want to go out like that. Not to mention, my ex-wife would get the house to herself and I couldn't allow that. By then, I'd spent enough time with out my mother in my life to understand that she was keeping me in trauma. Her dying words? ""I'm sorry I won't be here to take care of you."" To her grave, she was self centered. To her grave, I was centered on her.

It's been over a decade since my brother took himself out. I still struggle with survivor's guilt. I have no doubt my mother played a huge role in his demise. I still struggle with guilt and shame because I know his death was the catalyst for my healing.

I stand as a survivor today, not a victim. My battles are in my head, no longer in my real world. Every day I grow stronger and more confident. But I still get bothered as all fuck sometimes by days past. I can see the forest for the trees and I have a deep desire to burn it down."

I’ve always thought of myself as really self aware, my therapist said she didn’t know how to help me or what to say because of my self awareness. And I really do try to analyse my behaviour a lot. 

My issue is I have these insane mood swings, and it’s almost like I forget the bad parts of these mood swings. Multiple people in my past have said it’s like treading on egg shells with me and I could never understand why, it made me really mad actually. I’ve been called a whole host of names and been accused of being all sorts of things by old friends and roommates. I just assumed these people were A holes and cut off nearly everyone I know. But now I live with a friend who definitely isn’t an A hole. I ignore them constantly, and get really angry over a whole bunch of stuff. Everything triggers me. And turns out I’m total and utter control freak. However I can’t actually speak up or say what’s bothering me, it’s like I’m physically incapable. I’ll spend weeks / months planning how to bring something up and I just can’t. I go through all the possible outcomes in my head and I just can’t face it. But the annoyance / frustration of these things doesn’t go away, so of course it just builds up and up constantly, I’m mad at people and they don’t even know I’m mad at them (well they probably do because of my moods and behaviour). Every roommate I have had I do not speak to now even if we were close friends before, I really thought they were all fully to blame bc they did have their own problems for sure (way too much to divulge rn).  But now I’m thinking that was kind of a combination of them and me being “problematic” hence why it never lasted long. This current living situation has lasted but I feel like screaming and running away, I’m constantly having fits of anger and punching my walls. It’s silly but I want everything my way, I can’t cope when I’m not in control of everything and I’m now going through these frustration loops and trying to find other ways to regain control like extreme calorie restriction (didn’t know that’s what I was doing until I told a MH professional). 

So I guess my question is, are some of us just not able to live with others? I have an aunt that has always refused to live with anyone and has never really had a partner and it seems right for her. 
I feel like living with others / friends is something I keep trying and it never ends well, I know I’m at least part of the problem and sometimes the whole problem. I think I want to live alone but the friend I live with had made a lot of comments about enjoying living together, but this was before the last few months where I’ve basically locked myself in my room. It just seems it’s impossible for me to get close with people without me finding them really frustrating and distancing myself, at which point I’m just like an angry bitter little goblin that they’re scared to interact with. 

Open to any advice or just to talk about it with anyone who feels the same, thanks in advance :)"

Everything about that case reminds me so much of my abuse. My father is extremely wealthy (makes like 10mil a year) and used to live in Palm beach which is where Epstein was arrested/used to live. I grew up around a bunch of wealthy creep men with addiction issues. I Fast foward to when I was 13, my father's girlfriend (personality very similar to Ghislaine Maxwell) starts grooming me. This woman in her 30s is my ""best friend"" and buys me anything I want with my father's money, treats me like an adult. I also found out later she was trying to seduce my teenage brothers. By 14 she was feeding me extremely strong alcoholic drinks, and would let men at bars hit on me. That's how my first kiss happened when I was 14, a man shoving his tongue down my throat in a bar. How could NO ONE notice or care that a child was being abused at their bar/restaurant? Why did she always get away with everything with no questions? I remember once she took a photo of me with one of the men we met, and then a few days later she had his ID in her purse. She was probably extorting him for money, right? There's so many layers to this abuse & exploitation and I'll probably never truly know the extent as to everything that happened. I just feel so sick and angry at this whole thing. I tried bringing it up to my father a few years ago and he didn't really care, in his head 14 year old girls are basically adults and I was just being a "" wild teenager"" and I probably enjoyed the attention. I just feel so sick, angry, and outraged by all the people in the world that think the abuse of teenage girls is not a big deal, that Epstein's victims were ""bad girls"" and that no one ever truly gets punished for their crimes. I'm sick and tired and angry. These experiences when I was in middle school primed me to be groomed by a 50 year old man in high school, and all these things have royally fucked up my brain. I'm 24 now and it feels like my sexuality was stolen from me (I have huge problems with intimacy with my husband) I can't trust other people, I always feel like I'm being manipulated or lied to. I hate my father and I'm no contact with him. I hate the fact that no one cares about my abuse. I hate how much teenagers are sexualized and how in many places around the world it's ""normal"". I hate the ""lolita"" trope. I hate how rich men travel to impoverished countries to rape children and barely anything is done about it. I hate the ""teen porn"" category and how it's the most popular. I hate all of it and I just want to escape this world. I look at my cousin who is 14 and I can't believe that was how young I was. She is protected and safe because her family actually cares about her. She is allowed to develop normally and everything was robbed from me. For what? For money, for some sick satisfaction? Maybe I should ""get over this"" because I was never raped (I think?) so I it couldn't be that bad.

Elation, for I'm Able to Grow Insane Appreciation for Myself and Achievements","It's very late here but for the past 2 days I had been struggling so much with envy regarding opportunities. It really, *really* hurt, like actual physical pain, because I had to work so bloody hard and this person I envy got it just because he was there.

Anyway, I chose to feel it, sometimes just laying down in so much freaking pain.

If you've ever done something like that, you get it.

I apply many techniques from Miriam Greenspan's *Healing Through the Dark Emotions* and finally I got the breakthrough, epiphany of how, actually, the opportunity I felt so painfully envious about is almost nothing to what I've received and accomplished.

Financially, it's about a quarter.

So, like... truly the point of envy is rooted in being unseen, especially after hard work, just lack of that in general combined with your good ol' Asian ""Is this going to improve my Face? Is it braggable enough?""

But, my, I found a new whole appreciation for my past and accomplishments, and turning two years of many, *many* struggle, challenges, and actual mental breakdowns into something really beautiful, meaningful, that I genuinely feel super proud of.

Well, I suppose the butterfly is finally born.

Yet I had to let myself got dissolved as a caterpillar in a cocoon.

May we all move gently and peacefully towards more healing and health."

It wasn’t hard or anything. It didn’t leave a mark but it definitely stung. She even laughed when she did it because she claims she was “joking”. And no one in the room (my dad and sister) even flinched. And in an instance, I was launched back into my trauma like never before.

Does anyone else struggle when it comes to playing with toys? 

I have a 4 year old and she loves to play with toys. At first, I guess I didn't realize I had an issue. We'd play for hours, it was fun. My daughter would have a blast. I didn't realize until later I would dissociate more than normal the entire time and get so into the characters that I'd stop thinking of them as characters and dolls but they would basically reframed as me in my brain to the point I'd feel the full emotions. Like, if they were sad, betrayed or if someone broke up, I would feel as if it was psycally happening and react, even getting to points where I end up crying or angry. There were days I'd even lay in bed at the end of the night and re-feel/cry over the events, not as me, but thinking as if I was still the toys and daydreaming for hours about the made up story, still as if I was the toy.

I've definitely tried to watch and be more aware of how I feel while playing with toys... But It seems like it begins happening every time. It's definitely impacted some of my relationship with her as I can't do long play sessions with toys.

Luckily, any game where I don't have to change characters and I'm myself, I do fine with even If I still get into the story more than others.

I plan on being it up in therapy. I'm currently switching to a new one, yay US mental healthcare, but I was just curious if anyone else has similar experiences."

It just makes me feel so vulnerable. There is no one coming to rescue me. I have no one to turn to. The really funny thing is that while I have done my best to overcome these feelings by trying to build a new support system around me, it has always come crashing down on me.

I have no one to rely on and that scares me. I feel like there is a huge weight on my chest and I can't do anything about it.

I've tried all kinds of distractions. They work, but at the same time they don't. The feeling of being alone doesn't make me lonely. It scares me. I like being alone, but I need a support system to function like a normal person, and I don't have one.

Why do I need a support system so much? It makes no sense, and yet it does? I guess I just feel left alone in a desert. Being left alone sucks.

Like it’s an undeserved fluke and I’m taking something good away from someone who actually deserves it.  Anyone else feel this way?

I remember giving up a part I was offered in a High School play despite really wanting it, because I felt so undeserving and guilty about taking it from someone else. 

And more recently…my sister in law and I had babies within a few days of each other in 2022.  Her son, my nephew, passed away a few months later, and I’ve had some pretty intense emotional responses ever since. It’s gotten better with time, but I felt so very guilty even just holding my son after that. 😔 I didn’t feel I deserved to be the one with a healthy child. At the same time, it also made me more aware that sometimes bad things aren’t “deserved”, which was a pretty core belief of mine from my childhood. 

Anyway, just wondering if this is a common CPTSD thing, or more just a “me” thing.

CPTSD,feeling betrayed by someone I had very precious memories from,18z6ma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18z6ma3/feeling_betrayed_by_someone_i_had_very_precious/,https://www.reddit.com/user/the-anguished,the-anguished,2024-01-05 13:14:58,feeling betrayed by someone I had very precious memories from,"My cousin used to hang out with me a lot. 
Memories with her are mostly positive. She, just like me, is on the autism spectrum and she always seemed very straightforward, sometimes even cold and blunt. So that was always there.

But I remember her wanting to meet up and enjoying time spend with me and my sister.

We kind of lost contact throughout the years. We're now mid 20s. 
Her father was always on my side when it came to my horrible father. 

I noticed one day she's not following me on instagram anymore. 
Then I messaged her that I remembered very nice things and I'd like to meet up and chat. She was very curious about the 'trauma tea', as always I think.

We met up, I talked about things, to me it seemed obviously a little awkward but not 'no contact' awkward. 

Ever since that meeting we went back to little contact, she's not messaging, I'm the one messaging things. Now I asked her about something again, after she quickly responded to something, and her not replying is the answer to what I was afraid of. 

She doesn't want me in her life. For some reason. For no reason? Just like my brother doesn't want me in his life. 

I feel so used by her. I feel like she wanted all the spicy trauma drama tea and is basically ghosting me now.

It's so hard to accept this, after I reached out to her because once dissociated memories appeared and I felt like not everything in my childhood was awful.

Don't know how to cope now. I wish she would just directly message me that she doesn't see us that close together or whatever. 

It's also weird because her father cares about me so much. I'd love to talk to him about her but that's not his business. Just makes it awkward for me to reach out to him, knowing she for some reason doesn't want anything to do with me. 

Why?"

I’ve always asked questions about my diagnosis and what went down during that time. I’ve always received vague answers but recently I requested my medical records from that hospital. 

What I found was, I had procedures carried out on me during this time that I was never told about. For reasons I’m unsure of. I asked many times over the years if I had any operations etc to always be told no, I hadn’t. I also saw a lot of negligence in the sense I had many missed appointments over the years following my diagnosis. My caregivers were also unmotivated in understanding my condition and pursuing psychological and social care for themselves and the family. There was also negligence surrounding my hygiene during this time.

In the years following I developed a needle phobia and in one of the letters to a psychology referral, it was noted that my fears stemmed from believing I would not wake up, that when I would faint I could still hear voices but not move. It was also noted that I was hyper vigilant and my mother was quoted saying that “I would feel more comfortable not speaking with a man.” 

I grew up in a DV home and I have had exposure to unsafe situations and flashbacks of sexual abuse that I cannot seem to confirm if they really happened. I basically glanced over my whole medical file and will read it in more detail this evening to try and make sense of everything. Why do I feel like there is more to my story than what I think?

Should I seek out the reports from the time I saw the child psychologist? Should I enquire with social services if there ever was a file opened up about myself and my family?

One thing I know for sure, is that my caregivers were negligent in how they handled my diagnosis. I understand that it must have been terrifying and uncomfortable for them, but on the other hand I don’t understand why they wouldn’t remain consistent with my care during that very vulnerable time. I also don’t understand why I was lied to about undergoing any procedures.

I don’t even know where I’m going with this journey to be honest. I guess because I don’t have much memory of my younger years and have always received vague and patchy answers from my parents, I want to know my own story."

When I try to look at the past to reference how it affects the way I am now, there’s just nothing. 

I can describe what happened in words vaguely, “this happened and this happened and this happened”. But I recount it the way you recount fables you read as a kid, you just kind of recount it with no meaning to it, just a bunch of arbitrary things that sort of happen. 

I always believe I’m not trying hard enough but I’m pretty sure I need to loosen my grip. It’s hard to though when I can’t believe that I would ever need that. I can’t help but look at the opportunities I lose day by day and only feel more compelled to get over this. But doing so always makes me worse

I know the point is to just accept trauma as it is and deciding on whether it’s truly valid or not is pointless if it had affected you so strongly. But I just truly don’t see a reason or a need to heal when I can barely believe that it’s trauma at all and not just a bunch of bad stuff that happened. I keep feeling like when I accept bad things happened to me, I’m looking at things through an unappreciative and pessimistic lens. I feel stupid for being the way I am now because in the moment when it was all happening, I was “fine”. I was “happy” then. It’s like, “why do I feel like such shit now”?

Obviously things happened, but I just can’t accept it when I don’t really have anything to justify it. If I don’t have a justification I feel deluded."

I don’t know what’s right or wrong for me anymore and my senses are gone, and I know I have to figure that out for myself because putting myself “in line” to what other people think is right just keeps me dependent. 

Fawning absolutely destroys any sense of self in me, I start to want things that I don’t truly want at all because I think I should. Because I think I am meant to become nothing and serve another person to have a meaningful existence. It’s actually ridiculous, I rejected someone romantically once and to be honest I hated them. But I brooded over it for a week because I felt that responsible. But the part that is “me” is just unacceptable in my eyes, so I can’t help but mask it up with my fawning self. 

Hypervigilance makes everything worse, it’s one thing to be fragmented and confused. In addiction to that I can barely distinguish truly safe environments from whatever my brain is chronically afraid of. I’m just always afraid, whether I’m with a friend I’ve known for years or I’m with someone new, who has no expectations of me and there is no “line” to act in accordance to. Unless I’m completely isolated, my body feels unsafe. 

I thought of it in my head like, “I am a sock puppet of a human being”. I’m so confused and frantic I’ll just turn to the exterior to react to, because you can’t go “wrong” if you do what is “good”. But a lot of the time doing that makes me miserable and feel bad. But if I do what I truly want I may be acting selfishly and carelessly which makes me feel worse. 

I feel embarrassed and ashamed to be alive and the only thing that alleviates that is to do whatever other people want and say is best. Even when it makes me feel like shit. I’m too confused, everything makes me feel bad, everything makes me feel good, I don’t know anymore."

Sorry if this is long. Haven't found any help, and I'm experiencing a breakdown, triggered from a recent event apparantly.
I'm a 44 yo husband/father of a 6yo daughter and 9yo son.  Successful in my life but I have always had major anxiety.

In short, my mother watches my kids and nephew a few times a week after school, if I have work (from home). Today I was told that my mother's neighbor's boy, who's friends with my children and nephew, had my 6 yo nephew strip his clothes off while they were alone playing. Both 6 yo.

My children were not there. THANKFULLY.   Basically, when I imagine that happening to my daughter, I have a full blown uncontrollable crying panic attack. I almost lose control of my body, voice and have to sit down. I go from being a strong man and dad to something pretty pathetic in about 1 second.  As I type this I'm having one.m it a nightmare.  This is brand new as of 1-4-2024.

 This event with my nephew triggered something inside me that's awful. I'm realizing I have trauma from being abused by a drunk aggressive uncle, when I was around 9. I don't think he ever physically sexually did anything,  but he  would man handle me or be rough with me.  He would scare me till I pissed myself. Don't know how many times this happened.
 I told my parents but nothing was done, and I'm sure his scary demeanor didn't help. He scared me to death with his dog during my childhood too. It seems I have much more trauma from these events than I thought. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm holding a wound shut that just pours blood if I let go. And I don't want to let my kids out of my house. Causing major rift between my wife but she saw me fall apart last night and was shocked. Fml"

My abuse included so many horrible things starting so young it's impossible to cover it all but there was drugging with many different substances, molestation, rape, being forced to consume my own waste, and a number of times I almost died from suffocation, strangulation and the effects of the drugs.

He also attempted to develop me as a psychic which was a tradition in his family (which is a whole nother story) but he went beyond teaching me the tarot and about divination. He believed that certain kinds of r*pe would make me a more powerful psychic.

It got to the point where he screams uncontrollably and punches stuff. Everytime he tells me what he need but everytime our conversations end up with me crying and him being dissapointed and angry. He told me that if he could turn back time he would never date me.. He wants to controll my relationship with my family because he doesn't like them and think they disrespect him so recently he started taking my phone and looking through all my conversations and judging the way i speak to them. He even wrote to my mother as if it was me. He got so used to it that he started looking for my phone when i'm asleep. Usually i put it under my pillow because i don't have a shelf so he literally puts his hand under my head while i am sleeping to take my phone even tho that wakes me up and stresses me out.

so sometimes he still initiates sexting, and it’s fun and thrilling i think he’s so hot. but i also have started to feel knots in my stomach about it. i don’t think i want to sext him anymore because i want to reserve that for the people i’m dating, especially for someone who wants to commit to me. i lovee our friendship he’s so sweet to me but i feel hurt that he expresses sexual interest but not romantic interest. 

i don’t wanna be a castrating buzzkill when i tell him, bc given how our friendship started, it’s not unreasonable for him to assume i have no issues with it bc i haven’t communicated this to him. i would feel okay with sexting if i knew he had romantic feelings for me but i also don’t want him to feel pressured to date me. seeking input on how to approach this. feeling so overwhelmed. i am specifically asking: how should i word this? and when should i say this? when he tries to initiate sexting or in another moment?

tldr; need help with how to set a boundary with my guy friend. i don’t want to sext anymore because i have romantic feelings for him and i do not think he feels the same way"
CPTSD,I don’t know if my COCSA is COCSA or something else,18z1y4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18z1y4d/i_dont_know_if_my_cocsa_is_cocsa_or_something_else/,https://www.reddit.com/user/throwitout7337,throwitout7337,2024-01-05 08:21:50,I don’t know if my COCSA is COCSA or something else,"i’m gonna make it short

as a child there were three of us and we would engage in sexual acts, not real sex but pretty much everything but, i remember we would do things and then say that we couldn’t talk about it all to anyone. we knew it was wrong. 

here’s where my questions come in 

1. i definitely have been traumatized from this, but all of us consented, so what do i even call that kind of trauma?

2. i know it was “experimental” and “normal” but it feels like (for me) it was beyond the normal range in terms of what exactly was going on. that would be making out, grinding, everything but penetration, so where does that fall?

3. i’m pretty sure at least two of us had previous sexual encounters/assaults(myself included). does that have anything to do with it? 

4. over time (this lasted for years) me and one of the other children would be pressured into it, at first it was just the one child saying no but then the older child would convince him to say yes, i would just sit there, then eventually it turned to me saying no and then begging me until i said yes… where on the spectrum does that fall because we all consented but also we didn’t 

Again, it was all what I feel like would be considered experimental, and technically it was all consensual, but i have sexual trauma for sure, from this and other things, and i don’t wanna invalidate anyone but i also don’t know what else to think"

I don’t have any memories of SA as a child, only emotional neglect (my family is very religious). I got an ad for repressed childhood sexual trauma and I’ve gone down a bit of a rabbit hole. 

Some symptoms I have
- Frequent dissociation during childhood (I remember it happening more specifically around going to church and church events)
- Very few childhood memories and pretty horrible memory in general
- My first sexual fantasy in middle school was about bondage and being taken advantage (I’ve had rape fantasies since then)
- I have a lot of trouble orgasming and only want kinky sex (I feel so much shame around sex and feel completely empty and lonely after)
- I frequently age regress (also growing up, I sucked my thumb until I was 13)
- Multiple abusive relationships, feeling a need to please men (specifically older men)
- Digestive issues, mood swings, trust issues, impulsivity, etc. 

I’ve always had this sinking feeling that something bad happened to me but I have absolutely no memory of any abuse. Has anyone else felt this way and discovered it was csa? Is there any way to find out for sure if it’s just emotional neglect or if I actually experienced csa?"

I get so tired and feel like sleeping/hibernating when things get super hard. Even if I have ""energy"" if I suddenly feel stressed or overwhelmed by things (triggers or life events or just finding it hard to cope), I suddenly feel exhausted and soooo tired. I don't know what to do when this happens. I struggle to be productive if I try to push through it. Or I sleep then feel bad if I don't get anything done. But it's so hard. It makes me feel so worthless at times. Like I'm so lazy or something. I dunno. Just the exhaustion of surviving stuff or dealing with stress and I seem to crash and burn.

I started with DBT therapy and then she said she wanted to try EMDR which wasn’t working for me. I work at a youth shelter where I have experienced trauma both with the youth I work with and with poor management. She shared with me a few months ago that she didn’t feel comfortable doing EMDR while I was still working in the same place. I was originally looking for a new job but I’ve decided to stay where I’m at because, “the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t.” I understand not wanting to do EMDR work on the things that have happened to me at work, but she’s not willing to work on my past either, which is also still very queuing for me. I feel like since we stopped EMDR, there is no point to the therapy sessions. She shared with me this week that we could go down to fewer sessions and mentioned again that while I’m still working in the same place, that she’s not comfortable doing EMDR, but that I could find a different clinician that may be comfortable with it. I do feel like I have improved a lot over the past couple years, but that there are still things that are still deeply affecting my everyday life. I really valued her as a therapist and I’m thankful for the help she did provide, but this hit me like a ton of bricks. I feel helpless and like I’m going to suffer with the symptoms I’m still experiencing for the rest of my life. Like I’m too broken for therapy.

I have already been consistently lifting weights for a year and I plan on starting jujitsu in a couple of months. The studio that does the belly dancing also has yoga, so I will throw a couple of those in for some fun, but yoga frustrates me still. 

That said, I had the dance class to myself tonight, so a private lesson. I am an ok dancer, I can keep rhythm, and as Shakira said, “My hips don’t lie!” Tonight she had me do very basics and slow down all of the movements. I can do a few things at tempo, but slowing it down I have to think about it. If I think about it, I start to tense up and apparently I stop breathing (same issue I have in yoga, btw). So class tonight was a lot of, “You can release the tension.” “Relax,” and “breathe!” 

I enjoyed the class! I love to dance, but I walked out with my inner critic digging in and criticizing me for not being able to “get” very basic movements. Doesn’t matter that the teacher admitted that it took her months to be able to do exactly what I was trying, I should have “just been able to get it.” Luckily I am far enough in my progress to see that for the bull shit it is, but there it is all the same. 

On the drive home it finally clicked: My perfectionism tendencies don’t just include “do it right or don’t start it at all.” I had some experiences as a kid where if I didn’t do it right, I didn’t get to do it again. I had a small little part of me that was terrified that if I didn’t get those basic moves down perfect tonight, that I wouldn’t be allowed to come back, so might as well quit before it was taken from me. I’m exhausted from the amount of braining to puzzle that one out, but little part has been soothed and put to bed.

“Relax,” she said. “Breath,” she said. “See you next week?” she asked. I think she shall."

(TW)Graphic,"I've been in therapy for a long time, but I feel like I am in denial. And I keep ruminating.  
  
\#1: I was 10 and my cousin was 11. My cousin fingered me and I kept telling them not to do that. We did a bunch of other unfortunate and weird things  
  
\#2: A came onto a guy when I was wasted at 14. He may have penetrated me I dont remember  
  
\#3: I was 15 and a guy (17) pretended to want to go out a date with me. He kept making me give him head in his car and groping me and I was begging to leave. He ghosted me after. He later confessed/apologized to me but the police told me it wasn't serious  
  
\#4: I made out with a 21 yr old guy when I was 14/15  
  
\#5: FWB would randomly take the condom off in the dark without notice. Or he would put it in my ass when i was too high to really respond, but eventually took it out when i told him to.  
  
\-#6. Dude I was hooking up with regularly called me stupid. He held my legs down and made me have sex without a condom. Then he cuddled with me after. He told me he r@ped me and smiled. the next few days he was really paranoid i would go to the police. he got more sexually vanilla and i got mad at him about this and insulted his manhood. I was a mess idk.  
  
\#7- Dude took off condom intentionally and finished in me without warning, then stalked me for a bit because we 'connected' so much.  
  
\#8 i went to guy's house and he was much uglier in person. I told him previously about bad sexual experiences in a vague way. He's insistent about making out with me immediately and making me get on my knees to blow him. He returns the favor and it wasn't unenjoyable but he grossed me out in general. Guy becomes obsessed with me and also wouldnt leave me alone. i dont think about this a lot but i think its gross  
  
\#9 im rly high and dont know who i am. I'm pretty sure he laced the weed with a lot of ketamine. I had unprotected creampie sex with a guy while im at least partially passed out. But he did check in with me a lot. we begin dating. He gets obsessive and jealous. He would threaten to hit/rape me if she didn't have sex with him (in a calm voice). He'd also tell me how worthless i was when we cuddled together. But sometimes he'd also be caring and understanding if i didnt want sex. He got very mad at me (we both cheated on each other) and inflicted pain leading to me crying and getting a migraine, then left and cut off contact with me. Though ,he did try to reconnect many times. in the months after this I thought everything I said was so stupid and wrong I barely spoke  
  
\#10 Guy puts in it when i kept telling him not to without a condom. i got chlamydia.  
  
\#11 Idk a guy just started choking me after I went home with him and I went along with it. I guess it was fine. I told him I had to pee and he didn't let me so I peed on him, which annoyed him, but what was I supposed to do? tf lol  
  
\#12 I met up with a guy. I was really high and sleep deprived. He asked me for sex 40+ times, probably so he could tell himself he didn't rape me. I eventually let him and was barely conscious  
  
\#13- I didn't really count this one, but maybe I should have. He was my coke plug. He kept trying to make me finish and it hurt so I kept telling him to stop, and he wouldn't. I had to come up with a few obscure lies to make him stop  
  
\#14- I told him I didn't want to have sex with him anymore. He begged me to just 'sit still' and 'let it happen' but I hit him in the throat"

i wanted to apply to this car parts/automotive shop because they were looking for a cashier, and it seems to be more interesting, but i was wondering “oh, will i be able to work in a shop like this in texas? or would i have to be a full mechanic or something?” which i wanted to go to school for anyway, but that’s gonna take a bit

clearly, ill stay in a place if im “comfortable” but it doesnt always necessarily mean im happy or doing well. i just want to do well so i can get out of here, but thinking about it makes me beyond anxious and all i want to do is stop everything so i dont have to deal with it.

For intimacy, for good feelings, for trips for anything. I find that when I need him most, is when he can't be there for me. I have my own things (not as bad as him) and he triggers and pushes all of them. I too am triggering him. But it's so hard not to. He is so unreliable, he has soo many triggers and his trauma makes him so selfish. In those good moments I know he cares, I just can't rely on him so my mind is saying don't have more kids with him then you will be further on your own especially when you need him most. He's in therapy but doesn't ever breathe a word about his trauma and healing. So I'm meant to trust that he's working through it and just take care of myself when he is unavailable to me. My mother was unavailable to me often it brings back up that pain. I know I'm meant to re parent myself in those moments he is disengaged. But it is so painful. He's helping me heal showing me where I need help but at the same time I can't help but just say what I see. Which shuts him down further. He can't hear critisicm, even my asking him for a hug is too much pressure and expectations. He cannot accept my love, doesn't believe my compliments and often tells me he doesn't feel safe with me (but he doesn't with anybody..) ugh I really find him pathetic and actually:don't like him right now. l think that I'd have greater compassion for him if he told me about his trauma and how hard the work is for him. I hate being ignored, so I just keep reminding him in subtle ways how traumatized he is. Also I really dislike unawareness and he doesn't speak about himself in an aware way or clue me in to his being aware of his dysfunctional behaviors. So  feel like I need to let him know (his wife-the one person he hopes to have safety with). Is it possible to ever show a cptsd husband that you are a safe person if you feel they can't meet your needs? How can I be safe to him when I am presently being hurt? At any moment he may need to disengage (can be triggered by work, therapy, tired, hungry, flashbacks, I remind him of and 'become' his abusive father). How can I create safety, enough for him to heal when I'm actively being hurt by him? Ugh l feel so done!"

After years of medication, coping skills, therapy and “graduating” therapy only to return multiple times, along with intense physical symptoms of stress and several periods of horrible depression, I was diagnosed with CPTSD a few days ago.

A basic back story, I work with survivors of human trafficking, most of whom have this diagnosis. So when my therapist told me she believed I have it and would like to treat me for it, I practically laughed in her face. There’s no way my childhood compared to that of trafficking victims (to be clear, it still doesn’t-I have so much empathy and respect for these survivors). But she pointed out stories I’d mentioned-my history of intense pressure to succeed followed by parental emotional neglect. She told me to look at CPTSD from a different lens than I do with my clients. After doing so, I had a complete meltdown. It makes so much sense as to why I am the way I am or why I may have acted the way I have over the past 20 years.

Tonight I found this post from a year ago https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/OnYRWAfVkZ and it describes practically everything I’ve felt over the years. And the portion noting “emotional neglect within outwardly high achieving families can be as damaging as active violence in obviously deprived ones” is something I still don’t think I deserve to hear. My therapist also says I love to minimize my trauma 😌


I’m a huge mix of emotions and have had multiple panic attacks this week. Despite the crazy can of worms this opened and the fear of starting work towards real healing, I feel so much relief. I wish I had heard this years ago and been able to start the work then. It likely would have prevented a lot of heartache. But I’m grateful to have the opportunity to better understand myself, give myself grace, and ACTUALLY heal.

I am heavily dissociated and do not feel like a real person. But I have been making some progress lately where I can experience the EPs and some form of integration, and when this happens I definitely feel real and have a sense of self. The thing is, I feel like my life paused at like 10. I'm 31.

Maybe it's not a question that can be answered, or only on an individual basis, but I wonder how real the self is that has been in charge these last 21 years. She doesn't feel real, more a collection of fear responses and desperation. She's 'me' essentially - by pure habit I default to her behaviours and opinions. But she's so bereft of any kind of soul or spirit I do wonder what exactly she is. At least that's how it feels.

I was a very gullible child, easily trusted everyone and was taken advantage of on multiple occasions. I was abused sexually by classmates at school, I was abused by a kid in my building and by a cab driver once while playing alone outside, older kids would make me watch porn saying it’s a movie and force me to watch it. 

I’m not really sure what the long  implications of these are. I never told anyone this, my friends or my family even when I was a kid. Always held it in. I always thought I’m strong and I can handle it and never really thought about it until now when I’m older and I see how it has affected me. 

I don’t have many friends, very few and not the kind who really value me I feel. The more someone knows me, the lesser they respect me. I always pretend to be someone I’m not to fit in. I’m impulsive. I used to be a very angry kid, have it mostly under control. Apart from when parents push my buttons which they very well know how to. I am extremely insecure and I always think everything that comes out of my mouth is dumber than a rock, and often times when I somehow muster courage to say something, I’m so incoherent, I’m met with blank faces and comments about how stupid I am, and I am extremely hard on myself. It had led to jealousy at times but I’ve overcome it now.  I’m scared shitless when it comes to speaking publicly. I’ve dated a few people but have never been able to keep something stable going. The two longer relationships I’ve had ended up in them cheating on me, multiple times. I’m not a bad person. I just feel like I’m incapable of being loved and feel like maybe I don’t know how to. I’m anxious and depressed and lonely because I’m an immigrant staying 8000 miles away from the closest thing to family. I have motivation issues, I don’t know why but I’ve always felt like I can’t remember things, blamed it on lack of effort but maybe there’s more to it I don’t know. 

Im decently successful at my career, not a bad dude to hang around, but not someone who’d leave an impression and my parents think I’m a disappointment because I’m not married yet and I haven’t bought a house etc. They’re very good people, and have always done everything for me but they’re just too protective and conservative and get pressured from people around them. that’s forced me to lead a double life. They have no idea what my life is like. 

I think I’ve finally accepted that I’m not strong enough to think that the abuse I’ve faced won’t affect me. I think it has. I just want to get better and lead whatever normal life it is that I can lead. 
Do I have something to work on? See someone? Fix?"

CPTSD,Am I a bad person for keeping in contact with my indirectly abusive parent?,18yy2h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yy2h8/am_i_a_bad_person_for_keeping_in_contact_with_my/,https://www.reddit.com/user/CompetitiveGrand2008,CompetitiveGrand2008,2024-01-05 04:34:59,Am I a bad person for keeping in contact with my indirectly abusive parent?,"Many years ago, my parents finally got a divorce after 17 years of an abusive marriage. Dad never helped in the household (mum gave up her job to become a housewife), frequently shouted during fights, didn't treat her with respect and (most probably) cheated on her for multiple years.

My mum was constantly stressed out and completely overwhelmed with caring for two children (my little brother and me), having little to no support from friends and family. She often resorted to shouting and disregarding us whenever we expressed our own opinions. This and other behavioral traits (such as religious fundamentalism and obsessive over-protectiveness) made me not visit her more than 2-3 times a year since I moved out, even though I basically live around the corner. I never told her how I really feel towards her as she repeatedly contemplated harming herself over comparatively negligible things since I was 15. I also don't think she will ever realize this on her own, as she thinks I have been too busy to visit. She has always been quite naive.

My dad on the other hand never showed abusive behavior towards me. He sure was a scumbag husband, shouting at my mum (sometimes even in front of us children). But apart from that, I never felt like he would reject me for what I am and I believe his affection is genuine.

Since the divorce, my mum mostly talks about what a bad person dad was/is and that he will literally go to hell once he dies. I don't believe in the afterlife, but she does. I had a period of \~6 months where I went NC with my dad, mostly influenced by her stories and the realization that him abusing my mum made her mental instability much worse, which in turn intensified her abusive behavior. I suppose that would make it morally worse than just being a passive enabler. But he was also rarely present when mum was being abusive and when he did witness something he did tell her that she was being unreasonable.

So as you can see I am quite torn about my relationship with my parents and I don't know where to go from here. I know my mum is a victim as well, but we just have nothing to talk about other than her hatred towards dad. Meeting my dad on the other hand feels relatively good and we talk about common interests and stuff, but I somehow feel a bit guilty for ""choosing the wrong side"".

So I guess I have two questions I would like to hear some opinions about:

1. Should I tell my mother how her behavior made me despise her?
2. Am I in the right for staying on good terms with my dad, even though I know how his actions were indirectly abusive towards me?"

whats so ironic is that i am so very aware of how unhealthy this is. i know its awful for me to be so alone, to have such few friends in my adult life. its hard. im so incredibly lonely, but i wont let myself speak to other people, and i wont let people speak to me. i cant open up, no matter how hard i try. i end up drifting away from any person who gets close to me anyway, so theres almost no point anymore.

it just sucks. i miss having friends and having fun. i just cant help but be distant. im protecting myself from potential hurt, and i guess id rather be alone than hurt more."

However I did reach the point where I was no longer struggling this intensely and flashbacks/being triggered became much less frequent. I'm 21 now and it feels like when I was first developing ptsd. I get triggered by things that I thought I had gotten past for the most part. I also have intense catatonic episodes where I can't move and sometimes cant talk. It's so discouraging to find myself here again. I have everything I wanted as a kid (freedom, a home where I'm not being abused, people who love me, food, water, etc.) and yet I feel like I'll never escape the past. I don't want to be stuck here for the rest of my life. I don't want to exist in the past so intensely it takes over my present and my ability to enjoy life. I don't know what to do :(."

  (My father is a struggling alcoholic, and my parents have had a toxic relationship since they got married, and because of which I don't live with them anymore they have made my entire childhood traumatizing and they still continue to do so) 

When I intervened to stop her when she was attacking my father violently with a very sharp object, she turned her aggression towards me, causing injury 

I managed to help my father escape, but now I'm left grappling with the aftermath of this horrifying incident. My father is a harmless man, incapable of defending himself, while my mother seems to exhibit dangerous and unpredictable behavior.

I fear for my father's safety and wonder if, had I not been present, she might have succeeded in causing even greater harm. I'm seeking guidance on how to navigate this situation, legally and emotionally. Any advice or similar experiences would be immensely appreciated."

He’s thinking it will prevent major depressive episodes and CPTSD fight response when triggered. He said this will be helpful when going into trauma-focused therapy. 

I’m depressed often but taken wellbutrin. I also have Prozac but haven’t started it yet. Every week or two I have a major depressive bout where I’m on the ground unable to move all day, my inner critic is out for blood and sometimes I end up having a panic response thinking people are going to hurt me. 

I also get triggered and become a major asshole sometimes. It’s scary. It’s only happened four times, each this year. I swear and say whatever I can to tear people down and push them away from me. I don’t remember these episodes at all. I’m told later and sometimes some of it is vaguely familiar then but most I have zero recollection of. 

I also have tunnel vision and feel like I’m going to pass out when I’m triggered. For me the trigger is always trust, abandonment, loss or someone turning on me. 

I obviously need to do trauma therapy. I’ve put it off because it might be too intense and I’m kind of scared of what may come out. I’ve had a lot of revelations about my past and there’s some parts I want to reclaim but a few I may need to keep put away. I’m not sure I’ll have any control over what comes up. But maybe lamotrigine will help my responses. 

Outside of triggered moments I’m a very nice person. I absolutely hate I have this other thing that ruins that and hurts people close to me. If taking a pill daily prevents a couple trauma response a year, it’s worth it. I just can’t be someone who hurts people. That’s a life I just can’t live."

Difficult since it was my very first time doing that, but I felt totally fine.  Maybe 10-15 minutes after the session ended, I started feeling very dissociated.  I have experienced it on some level 24/7 for as long as I can remember, but I'm in the heavier state, which for me is trance-like: blank/autopilot mind, staring off into space, out of body feeling, etc.  I also started to suddenly feel sleepy whereas I wasn't before at all.  I'm making myself stay up because if I go to sleep this early, I'll be up too early.  Has anyone else experienced this though?  Any idea why?"

Please advise me if you have had similar experiences and how to cope. I was the eldest son in a family of emotionally immature and highly toxic parents. 

I concede that both my parents had their own unresolved traumas and this is a generational thing in my family. Doctors are not trusted and religion is used and abused to justify toxic behaviours. I was a gifted kid, high achiever at school, despite constant bullying at school and seeing my parents engage in physical violence with each other and with myself. I was badly beaten by both my parents on the slightest excuse and verbally mocked. 

I developed a stutter around 5 years old and worked hard to overcome it till my early teen years. I learned everything in life by trial and error. I wanted to be a cycle breaker and was even proud to be the black sheep as a teenager. I revolted and grew completely independent, abandoned my studies slightly. Abandoned everything and anything that connected me with my parents. I got back to my senses and tried to rebuild my career in my 20s. I suffered tremendously due to social problems. I tried therapy but it was completely unhelpful.

Now in my early 30s, I feel like a complete failure and feel as if my parents’ predictions of me being a lifelong failure have come true. I am exhausted and beaten by life. I hate my parents for the active part they played but now seeing them old and physically helpless, though still venomous in speech, I am conflicted. I am daily on the verge of ending my life. How do I proceed? Apologies for the long rant."

I stopped talking in calls because I don’t wanna worry you anymore. You didn’t notice, and if you did, you made no comments. We sit in silence a lot now, I just listen to you exist when all I wanna do is tell you about the dumb things my friends are doing. But i don’t wanna upset you. I’ll continue to just sleepily watch you play games like a good girlfriend. I’ll learn to be less worrisome. I’m tired of causing you misery just because everyone else has hurt me. I’m sorry i trust you too much and that i’ll babble on like my life is normal, when I know its bad. You’ve been surrounded by love your entire life, you know of cruelty only from an outsider perspective, but I know seeing it torment your lover is harder then just knowing its out there. 

I’m sorry I don’t take my medicine. I know you like me better when i’m medicated. I don’t though. I feel lost on my medication, but i’ll do it to make you happier with me. I wish you’d praise me more for it, but your not the type to talk much, let alone tell someone something like that. 

I wanna tell you what goes on in my brain, but I can’t tell you. I cannot explain to you that i’m suffering. You are clueless to the demon that is killing me. Your unaware, because you’ll never know. I’ll never tell you over our calls that i’m causing my own death. You’ll notice next time you see me. Maybe i’ll be too far gone by then. Its only 3 months till you get to see me again. I’ll hopefully be prettier, more appealing. Though i’ll be at my worst, constantly trying to please something that will not be pleased till i’m dead. 

I hope you talk to me more. I just wanna feel loved. I love talking to you, I don’t care what about. I wanna exist along side you. I wanna understand your interests, but i’m to stupid to. I’m dumb, i’m sorry about that. All I can do is write and read. I write stories you don’t wanna look at because they’re to sad. I write poetry that you would rather forget existed. I’m sorry that i’m so dumb I can’t understand your nerdy interest. I wanna know more, I wanna make you feel understood and listen to you ramble about nerd stuff, but i’ll likely never understand it. You could explain it to me a million times and i’d never wrap my head around it. 

 I’m sorry that i was hurt as a child, and though i’ve healed, I still show signs of being a broken person. I thought I was healed enough, but I don’t think i’ll ever be normal. The damage is too great. I’ll never write a happy story or a poem that you’ll actually read. I write as a way of coping. Those characters you hate are just pieces of me. It makes me feel awful when you say you don’t wanna know about my newest writing piece. But I understand, you wanna keep your peace. You don’t crave sadness like everyone else in my life does. 

I don’t know why we’re together. You knew coming into this relationship I was a broken human being who will never stop being one. I bet you thought you could fix me. You can’t piece me together. No amount of kindness and silly memes you send me will ever heal me completely. No amount of hand holding and kisses can piece my brain back together. I will forever be somewhat of a worrying person. I’ll have weird behaviors. I’ll say weird things. Thats just how I am. But for now, i’ll stay quiet. I’ll let you believe that i’m healed, that maybe i’ve finally understood that you aren’t meant to hear about my day to day concerns. I won’t let you know if i’m hurt, i won’t let you worry over me. 

If your lucky you’ll never have to worry about me ever again. Maybe you’ll finally have the peace you want with someone who isn’t like me. I bet you’d be happier with someone who wasn’t traumatized. I know I was never meant to be in love. I’m too hurt to have ever thought i’d have the right to love another, or be loved. 

I’m sorry to my lover, S."

The reason being I spent 3 years over in Iraq and one night took a mortar to the side of the head.  While I dont suffer from nightmares (I almost never get deep enough to have dreams or nightmares, or stay asleep long enough), I am however a super light sleeper.  The VA diagnosed me with PTSD and Hypervigilance which means I'm on alert all the time.  It's a trigger that almost never turns off, even in my own home, though it tends to feel better being home than anywhere else.  


My sleep pattern is horrendous, the VA reported that I woke up 19-24 times a night, most of which I'm aware of because I'm tossing and turning.  To give an idea of how sensitive my sleeping is, turning my cell to vibrate and putting it on a padded table or couch will still wake me up.  I need to figure something out that will put me to sleep and help me stay there, I'm so tired of never having energy.

 I took a test regarding how certain situations affects my stress. It states I have a very low stress level that would say I don’t need to be in therapy but here I am.

 We think it might be due to my PTSD (particularly due to years of dissociation) rather than my Depression. 

I cry during therapy but can hardly ever pinpoint why I’m feeling this way and/or where it stems from. I can tell she’s getting increasingly frustrated with me. I am too. It makes me want to give up and quit therapy.

 There’s times when I can possible identify an emotion or guess where it’s coming from or how I feel but I’m usually too scared to tell her and idk why.

But at the same time, I don’t know if I’m healthy enough to maintain our relationship. 

He cusses all the time, and I generally don’t cuss as much. I’m not like some puritan, but I just don’t cuss very much. 

When he cusses in any sort of negative way, it’s incredibly triggering. I feel so small, like I’m a little kid again with all those horrible things being said and done. He knows all this, but he still doesn’t stop cussing. 

I try to just let it go, but sometimes it’s just too much. Especially when it’s directly at me, my brain just shuts down. Today, we were doing something pretty frustrating, and he started throwing around the cussing again. I started getting triggered, but tried not to say anything. Eventually, I start shutting down because it’s too much, and he notices that I’m acting different. He can never tell when I’m scared, he always thinks I’m mad for some reason. So he starts getting real snippy with me, which makes me shut down even further. Eventually he cussed directly at me, basically I handed something to him from too far away. It hurt his back to reach that far, so he snapped at me and said “that shit hurts!”

That was pretty much my breaking point, brain function stopped entirely and all I could do was stand there mindlessly. But then he started hammering me with questions, “why are you doing this? Why are you acting this way?” And all I can do is half heartedly say that I was just trying to hand him the object. I was standing too far away because I was scared of him, but of course if I’d said that, everything would get much worse. So I just stand there. We move on and finish our task, and he goes to the bathroom and I take the opportunity to cry and get all the terror and hurt out of my system. 

I know that he just doesn’t understand, he can’t read my emotions so he doesn’t understand that I’m afraid. It’s hard to change habits, especially stuff that comforts you, so I get that cussing when he’s mad isn’t some switch he can flip. It just hurts so much, I’m so sick of having to cope with fear constantly. He deserves someone stronger, who can handle something as simple as some bad words. My chest aches, I hate that feeling of seeing him as all those monsters from my past. He’s not those people, but my broken mind warps him into them when he scares me. I just wish I could scrub my brain clean and be normal. I’ll never get to be the strong, well adjusted person I could have been, and I hate how much it haunts me every single day.

When I was younger, I was being abused by my dad but I blamed myself for it. It took me a long time to admit to myself that he had hurt me and that the abuse wasn't my fault. I still feel guilty, like I'm making too big of a deal out of it. In my adult life, I struggle a lot when I am wronged, especially by someone I care about. It triggers me right into the thought process I had around my dad. I get confused about my reality... did they hurt me? Am I overreacting? Are they a bad person? Am I a bad person? I tend to convince myself I was wrong and shrink my hurt. It ends up being that I try to people please with them while feeling so much anger for them underneath. I also struggle immensely with standing up for myself. While I love all of my friends, I noticed that I can draw people who aren't very nice. Or rather, I don't stand up for myself when I'm hurt by another person, so any dynamics where I am being the one hurt in the relationship tend to continue. It's only recently I feel equal to my closest friends and not resentful of them because I can't stand up for myself and instead raging internally that they're not a good person."

.
My parents cornered me two days ago in this flat. Mother sat in front of the door and father locked me in. The last bus going to my work left and I knew I am going to be late at that rate. 
I honestly thought about jumping off and run, considering there was no other way to escape, but hey it was 3rd floor, I would be very dead. 
I panicked and panicked some more, tried to push my mother and tried to push open the door. Ny father interpreted that as an attack and started hitting me; world went black and I was in a fight mode.
If this would happen half a year before I would be drowned in guilt and self loathing; now, I was glad that I fought. 
It wrecked me. Throwing me out was in the question. I was scared and crying like never before.
Barely made it to work. Didnt drink at all. But I thought; I can get through this. Only my right thumb had a bit of a scab, otherwise no evidence of any fight.
I was a mess, but still did well enough, even if dehydratation was slowly making my head fuzzy.
And it didnt end well. 
There is a door with stuff, like in my leg level. They dont close well. And as per usual, I kicked it in forcefully to get it out of my way.
Well, I left out one detail; I kicked in the point of my thumb, too.
My right thumb.

Hurt more than I expected. Long story short; a painful bruise was left. Arnica during the night helped greatly. Honestly I thought they are not even going to take me seriously.

Well shit, I fucked up. One shock and cast later, I supposedly have broken? Cracked? Splinted? Who tf knows? A bit of that right thumb. It didnt hurt at all. But oh well.

Should be glad to rest, right?

I am right handed and an artist. I am going to artschool. I needed to get my projects done during these last days of the break. I am fucked. I cant write, I cant draw, I cant have fun, I cant create and work on my own projects, my joy, my future, and my only hope to leave that fucking job and never returning. 
I cant take my gf out on that ice skating date I was looking foward to. I can't go skating on my skateboard. I am utterly powerless and trapped within the confines of this stupid cast I don't even feel like I need. 
They didnt tell me how long I'll have to endure this thing on my arm. Frankly, the whole thing was a trainwreck, but that is just how my country's healthcare works.
I know Ill have to have a checkup in five days. Ill do my best to hopefully convince them I dont need this and have something less immobilising. 

I dont even give a shit about some lil fracture. Had one on my pinky, walked it off, nobody even knew. I cam deal with pain. I actually like pain. I indulge in it. What I do give shit about is creating and escaping this hell. What I do give shit about is school and half year. Two weeks is already long, and if they force a month upon me Ill get this off myself, no fucks given. 

I cant imagine my life without writing and drawing. Week, fine, will push through, two weeks, fuck, fine, month? No. I do not have a month. 
I cant take a month. My plans are already crumblingband Ill be so behind and everything is fucked and I am trapped in this stupid cast that I donr even know how long Ill have. I hate being trapped. Being trapped was what led me into this. I hate it. I hate being powerless, useless, worthless. 

I am stubborn, though. Typing this feels terribly slow, sorry for any typos if they are, and drawing feels quite bad and slow, but I will persist. Fuck this weak body I will fight. No matter what.

Even if I want to cry because my frustration, anger and sadness is belittled, ignored, mocked, shamed. I think I have right to feel things. After all, something I love has been taken for indefinite amount of time and deadlines are creeping up. After all, my joy has been taken from me and I was already spiraling long beforehand. 

Maybe I am oversensitive, overreacting. Maybe I am insane for wanting to break the cast and get rid of it. Maybe I am this and that. I dont care. I have to fight even if I know I am worthless right now and absolutely powerless and stuck in a situation there is no getting out of."

My ex I was with for 6.5 years said I needed to “de thaw” or “warm up” to him for a few hours after I hadn’t seen him for a few days. With my new partner, who I’ve been with for 7 months, the longer we go without seeing each other, even just for a few days, the less inclined I am to respond to his texts. I get to the point where I feel emotionally detached and don’t want to answer his calls or even have physical contact with him when I first see him in person again. 

I don’t feel this way with my friends or family — I feel like we pick up where we left off and I don’t feel like I forget about them when we’re not there. 

This is causing issues for me in the relationship because I don’t like having to take time to get comfortable with him again, and it causes issues when we’re apart because I basically forget who he is and feel odd texting him or talking on the phone.

It's just astonishing to me. The other day someone told me about 2 people being kidnapped in a foreign country, and the authorities of their country of origin raising an international case to get them back.

I stopped for a minute because I automatically thought ""imagine if this was me"" and I simply could not imagine my life having that much value? Just the same way that I cannot imagine my friends organising a surprise birthday party for me...

Or imagine I did a fundraiser to pay for my doctors? And people actually valued my life enough to pay me? Or if I had a social media account (I don't) and people actually supported me in my struggles?

Unthinkable.

I am autistic, I can't connect with people, plus my face is wrong really, it inspires people to hate me before I open my mouth at all. I can't imagine a *group* of people actually genuinely valuing my life. This is unthinkable to me. 

I can't imagine people not finding me ridiculous, pathetic - some*thing* that is weird and deserves hate. I just cannot imagine myself being seen as more than that. ""Smart"" is more or less the only compliment I ever received. ""Smart"" but I always felt like no one would care if I die. Like it would be normal.

Is anyone else is a position where their trauma responses control their life/are so self-sabotaging and impactful every day if not nearly every day, but you were oblivious for so long and feel like an imposter because you've seen several counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, so on growing up and as an adult but they never saw it/validated it? I have found therapies like cbt so difficult but have been met with frustration when I couldn't do what was expected or communicate my feelings/explain what was wrong and when I shut down/had more appointments than allocated but didn't feel ready to leave the service.

Later in life diagnosed with adhd/asd traits for context. 

But every time I have a trauma response like self neglect and letting others walk all over me, not asking for my needs to be met, or engaging in things I'm not comfortable with or able to do regardless of how that affects me after, it's always been treat as if it's normal or something that everyone does. For a long time I believed everyone felt suicidal but that I just didn't handle it as well as they did and I believed it was because I was weak. Everyone has always been so annoyed, irritated or angry at me for struggling emotionally or not ""getting over it"" so I've suppressed it and felt incredibly uncomfortable, dissociated a lot and hid away, despite screaming inside then going past that to just complete apathy and being unable to engage in anything, self isolating and withdrawn.

I'm feeling so broken about it all, because I've never understood and it's never been validated.

I'm applying for financial support and I can't even explain my struggles properly because I was always told I was dramatic and ungrateful and needed to get over it (it being alexithymia, extreme overwhelm and sensory overload and more) and so I dumb down my experiences to make it easier for others and I tell myself I'm being dramatic or that it isn't that bad and other people have it worse so I just need to get over it (I'll be a burnt out suicidal mess, not coping but not able to reach out for help either, spiralling and hiding away but still not believing it's bad if that makes sense)

In the US. 23F. Social services won't help me because I am severely disabled. I can't make my own food and need household accomodations. At one point I had enough money to support myself for one year without working but could not find a place to rent because I had a gap in income and employment history from when I was trapped in a room and starved. Once I finally found a place, I couldn't go because no one helped me move. I hired five people and all five cancelled or ghosted. Now I have nothing. There are many, many, many similar events where I have had everything I needed except a path. All of this has been so stupidly preventable it is a CRIME that it was not stopped. Besides discrimination and rape culture, I geniunely can not understand how nothing has worked. It must be because everyone is terrible and evil and neglectful. If they do not help other people one hour a week then they have committed the heinous crime of neglect. 

I can't stress about bills. That would make my disability worse. I would die. My family destroyed my life intentionally, and if I stress about bills that would indicate that they got away with what they did. I know everyone stresses about bills but they have family. They have sanity. They aren't disabled. They were never a victim of torture. My disability is so severe I need a higher level of care than an assisted living facility. I can't stress about bills. I can't stress about people not wearing covid masks. I have geniuneinely never met a person who has gone through what I've gone through and made it out. The closest comparable people had something that I didn't.

How do I leave? There are millions of solutions. I could co-found an assisted living facility or care giving service. I could co-found a mutual aid group and have someone find a place to squat that has the accommodations I need and dumpster dive food for me. I could move to a country with a lower cost of living. I could make a Go Fund Me. None of those things are things I can do without support. Support to ensure that, if I have everything I need, there is a path to use it. That there isn't some ridiculously stupid, solveable thing that doesn't get solved and destroys everything I have worked on for months.

I feel like starting a protest. Making a list of demands. I want a healthy family. I want money. I want food. I want medical care. I want a safe place to live. And if I don't get that, I'll do something that I don't want to say out loud. Please give me options. I'm begging you.

I'm sure you folks are familiar with this dynamic of assuming the other person is going to say yes to your request because you're supposed to be dependable and reliable and if you said no then you also lose the ability to ask them for anything.

Or maybe that's just a toxic thing my mom does.

But anyway, she tried to drop this on me with 3 days notice that I'm supposed to babysit her dog for 72 hrs a week from Monday until June. Just assumed I would say yes. This sent me into complete shut down. I wanted to skip town I was so anxious, I was willing to cut everyone off!

But I was able to speak to my therapist and she helped regulate me and was able to show me how I actually had a choice in this situation and it wasn't as helpless as I thought. 

So I told my mom that I can do 1 day a week and I'll help her find a sitter. No over explaining, no apologizing, it was a short and sweet reply to her text. I didn't want to leave her completely high and dry. 

I'm so fucking dysregulated again. My nerves are shot, I'm hot and sweaty and then I'm clammy and cold, I had a 2 hr sleep attack, nausea, diarrhea, I feel like I want to skip town again. I don't have the means the skip town but it's my mental substitute for sui ideation.

Was it really so bad I needed to go no contact? My partner of 8 years confirms that it was but I'm still stuck feeling like the bad guy.

The holidays were hard. My family would always order chinese food(we live in Canada)for new years eve and I couldn’t eat it cause it upset my stomach aside from one dish from one specific restaurant. But they always picked somewhere else cause my aunt didnt want to order from there so I was stuck eating grilled cheese for supper. Someones preference(for no other reason than ""didnt want to order from there"") was more important than me being able to eat something from a restaurant and being included. 

This was one of few examples my brain is able to conjure up because for some reason I cant remember other specific things. My parents had unreasonable expectations and they guilt tripped and compared us siblings. But specifically I struggle to pull up more than a half dozen memories to prove that I was treated badly.

TRIGGER WARNING - physical abuse of kids  
I mean abuse like kicking, hitting, dragging your children, calling them names and \*name all horrible personality traits\*, hysterically overreacting about minor inconveniences (child wanting something, child speaking in the car, child having a nightmare) and blaming others for whatever happening, all during hysterical shouting. Complete inability to apologise (partly probably because of the missing memory) and all is triggered by stress, self-doubt and insecurity, helplessness. The reactions are unpredictable, depending on the mood - one day may go shitty and she is still fine, other days even a small event causes mayhem.   
It would also help me if there is someone with similar experience. We are 3 kids I (F29) and brothers (M19 and M15). We have blurred memories, but I know for sure that the pieces I remember happened and so does my brother. During this Christmas, a common family fight turned in an unexpected therapy direction and I told my brother that our mum does not remember how she beated him regularly and shouted at him almost every day when he was little. Both mum and brother were genuinely surprised. Of course, she does not believe it, but she wants to go to therapy or hypnosis or something to remember.   
And I am scared, I didn´t plan on telling her, I told my brother because at that moment he wanted her to acknowledge the beating and he was getting desperate that she did not. When she is confronted with even minor wrongdoing, she tries to blame everyone else and when that is not possible, she starts a self-pity journey ""I am the worst person/mother/daughter/wife on the planet"".   
I do not blame her, it may be biology, I know she has had trauma in the past (death of her father when she was a teen, dramatic relationship with her mother - they lived together all her life). But I don´t know much about her - she was never the person to share emotions with and neither I nor my brothers have a close emotional relationship with her and she has no idea.

I'm starting to try to figure out whether I have some unremembered trauma. I do have some remembered trauma, but for the past fifteen years at least, I'm thirty-four, I've been wondering if there is something else. A few weeks ago I discussed some of my childhood behaviors with my therapist, and she's saying that they are a strong indication that there is something I'm not remembering and that the remembered trauma's elements don't explain them.
The behaviors are as follows.
FIRST, the childhood masturbation. I started around the age of three or four. I don't remember doing the typical self exploration that a child does, I just remember knowing that masturbation was a thing I could and wanted to do, and that I needed to hide from others while I did it. I masturbated at least once a night and once a day, often more times than that, and always to climax. My therapist is saying that children that young don't typically masturbate so often and not to climax, but other stuff I've read says it's perfectly normal.
I also developed Pure O OCD at around three or four, and the typical onset for a child is between twelve and fourteen. My intrusive thoughts always manifested as violent urges which were accompanied by intense remorse. And between the ages of three and nine I would sometimes act on my violent intrusive thoughts toward animals. I never killed or badly enjured an animal, but I feel so sick thinking about what I did do. And the thing about OCD intrusive thoughts is that the person having them never ever acts on them, and I don't know if I did because I was so young and didn't know how to regulate, or if I'm wrong about them being OCD related.
I also remember feeling intense, seemingly random anxiety that I had no safe place to be or person to go to. But both of my parents were and are loving and attentive, as were my grandparents and aunts and uncles. My dad could be emotionally and verbally abusive, but not to the point of calling me names or insulting me.
I also had some phobias as a child. One was of balloons. The other was of battery acid and only lasted for about a year, but while it existed there were times where I was afraid my parents were poisoning me with it, even though I knew they weren't.
The two traumas I can remember are being toilet trained by my dad who always got very angry and ragey and shaming toward me when I had accidents, this was from age three to six. I'm pretty sure some of the accidents were due to encoprasis. And the other trauma memory is of being on a bus at the age of four and an older child touching me inappropriately. But my therapist doesn't feel that that explains the childhood masturbation because it was not done in secret and it didn't feel pleasurable, so wouldn't have intrigued me to masturbate.
The current sexual anxieties are this. I'm having trouble Being present in the moment when my fiance and I are having sex. I don't know if it's always dissociation, but there are definitely times when it has been. I'm able to feel fully present and aroused when we're slowly starting out with touching and kissing, but once it moves passed that I usually stop feeling pleasure and feeling present. And when I masturbate I usually have to think of very spacific things in order to climax, but now some of those things are starting to feel triggering to think about, even though I still need them.

I’m currently stuck in an extreme freeze triggered by my nmother’s antics, I’ve not gone back to work since new years so that’s 3 days ive missed unable to really explain why (the first day I just said gastro) and I’m currently very hyper dysregulated but unable to actually DO anything cus I’m stuck in a freeze which I know from recent therapy is my body protecting myself while my brain is in suicidal mode.

I don’t even know whether or how to let my employers know the real reason (it’s a law firm we have a strict number of days we can take off leave and it’s an East Asian city so access to suicide prevention help is not easy to get instantly) because they’re awful about sick leaves I know from hearing it firsthand they talk shit (more like the bosses yell behind closed doors but everyone can still hear) whenever someone takes a sick leave

the whole thing is making me very anxious. thought of going in is making me anxious thought of not going in is making me anxious, I really just want to end feeling this way.

I have just spent like 17+ hours in bed everyday the whole week… forcing myself to get up to eat or do basic needs

don’t really know what to do. that’s all. 

I have already messaged my therapist’s office for an appointment but no response yet. 

calling Samaritans freaks me out bc if any Extreme Measure is taken I’m scared of repercussions from my parents

I’m so sick of having this sort of response when I am in a high state of anxiety and dysregulation"
CPTSD,Am I a jerk?,18ynd7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18ynd7m/am_i_a_jerk/,https://www.reddit.com/user/finnleyyyyy,finnleyyyyy,2024-01-04 20:42:30,Am I a jerk?,"Am I a jerk for not only not wanting to forgive my father but also not liking him, despite the fact that he really changed for the better?

For some background info: my dad isn't the main cause of my CPTSD, mainly he gave me daddy issues, attachment issues. I'm not even sure if what he did can be qualified as ""trauma"". I leave it up to you to tell me. 
When I was a kid (age maybe 6-12?) I felt like my dad pushed me away (I'm saying that I felt like this because no one can confirm it, my twin brother doesn't have the same experience as me even though he was the same towards us pretty much). I'll get into the details and tell you what he was doing:
- due to stress at work he used to baste at us, by blowing up over small things and raising his voice a lot. My mom said that it wasn't that bad and said I probably felt like it was because of my sensory issues and hearing sensitivity, but I'm not sure.. I still remember the nightmares that I had because of that. I was pretty scared to ask for anything because I couldn't recognise what mood he was in (I'm autistic) which meant that if I encountered him angry would mean he would yell at me.
- He made me feel like he didn't love or like me; I constantly felt I was annoying, weird or dumb. Sometimes I even considered myself useless. I still crumble whenever he expresses at least a bit of annoyance.
- Whenever I misbehaved, instead of talking to me, he would take away the most important stuff to me or threatening to take them away. He still does that somehow but in a different way.. (last time I told him I didn't want to shave my legs because its my body my choice, he said that in that case, he won't be going to the store with me even though he knows I'm really scared to go alone because it's his body his choice)
- He never really took interest in anything I did when I was a child; he never listened about my friends, school, my interests. All he did was scroll through social media or watch TV while I talked, which quickly made me realise what I'm saying was not important at all. 
- As I mentioned, I'm autistic (late diagnosed) which means I often don't understand jokes. And he sometimes made really cruel jokes. Sometimes he would punch me or just do something, sometimes it did hurt a bit (it never was a hard punch nor anything abusive or dangerous. It was just unpleasant sometimes, especially when I didn't want to be touched) He would also push me away whenever I needed a hug, as a joke but at the time I didn't always get that and sometimes it really upset me (didn't show it though). His last joke was throwing a backpack full of book at me when I was laying in my bed. 
- The last thing I remember that really hurt when was I cut myself for the first time and he looked at me like he was ready to disown me. Maybe it's not that bad because I get it how you can be dissapointed that your child is doing something like this I guess. It just hurt when he told me to think how will I look with such ugly scars, or when he looked at me with almost disgust in his eyes.

These are the major things that I remember that I think made me feel the worst. I don't want to make him look like a monster because those things are not that bad I guess. Anyway, he changed. He became more affectionate and he started caring about me and my personal life. He became a better person I guess.

That's where my question comes from; am I a jerk for not forgiving him and not liking him? Cause I feel awful that the thing I was most scared of as a child (being disliked by him) is what I am now doing to him. 

Please be brutally honest with me, I really need it."

She said that it was important to remember that not all people understand things through the same experiences, and that my psychiatrist was probably saying things to the best of his knowledge, without awareness of my specific trauma. This comment really irked me, and felt like she was playing devil's advocate, or justifying his inconsideration - but is this how it comes across to you?

I just need to get this off my chest and out of my head)

I've been isolated too long and am 
generally too weird to be walking around on the street. Too many encounters where people act afraid of me and are repelled by my face. I look at myself on bad days and I see what they see: someone who has been hollowed out by too many years in intense pain and anxiety, someone whose light has died. I held it off for as long as I could, tried to fake it until I could make it, but after the last traumatic relationship and the rejection I felt during my last PHP I couldn't convince myself that I was worth knowing. I internalized it all and decided that I was the problem, that something about my aura turned people and situations toxic and that it was better if I stayed away from everyone. I might have been okay if I had even one safe person to hold me, if I belonged to some people somewhere. I needed evidence that I was good and that I mattered, but I got confirmation of the opposite. My therapist periodically suggests I join a group, not grasping the fact that people react negatively to me unless I am extremely focus and actually self-confident, that people can sniff out when I am anxious and uncomfortable, which is most of the time. Been there, done that. Why in the world would I put myself into a position to be rejected, seeing expressions of fear and disgust all around me, when that is what is destroying me? The PHP was a place that had been a refuge, but the last time I went I got avoided and ignored by clients and counselors alike. That's really what finished me off; when the only place where I did belong cut me off and stopped supporting me.

I am not a bad person. I don't lash out at people. I'm thoughtful, don't make a fuss about things, believe that all creatures great and small have a place in this universe, and that we are all one. But my face reveals that I have been rejected so much that I no longer believe in myself, and that I have thought about and seen too much of the dark side of human life. My face reveals the dark places that I went to when everyone I counted on turned away. I've been fighting to get back into the light; and I am better than I was, but when I have a bad day and people react it pushes me right back into the darkness.

I think I should be on antidepressants but because I have a diagnosis of bipolar I can't just ask my GP for them. The only times I have been so unstable that I had to be hospitalized every year were the years I was on antipsychotics, which would be the first (probably only) medication that I am allowed to have. I used to have a pdoc who worked with me on this, but he retired years ago, and most pdocs these days don't accept my insurance. 

I haven't given up on myself. I believe that I can regain belief in myself. I am working hard to figure my shit out. I just need people to stop acting like I am the antichrist. At this point I am wondering if I do need an exorcism. This world has no tolerance for people in acute distress. It makes me sicker to be treated this way. 

Life is a long hard slog."

CPTSD,Sometimes I wish I was born into a mafia family,18ylmm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18ylmm9/sometimes_i_wish_i_was_born_into_a_mafia_family/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Top-Mechanic-5494,Top-Mechanic-5494,2024-01-04 19:31:23,Sometimes I wish I was born into a mafia family,"I know this sounds weird and stupid but let me explain.  
  
Unlike most people here, I was never abused in my biological family. My parents didn't beat me, and there was no sexual violence.  
However, I was very much neglected. So much so that I didn't bond with my parents and when they died when I was 11 (my mother died in front of me), I didn't care at all. I never mourned my deceased parents because I didn't feel the need to do so.  
However, I am a traumatized person. Already in my early childhood, I experienced painful physical, emotional and even sexual violence (I was molested by a group of boys), but not from my parents, but from strangers; peers, other adults, other family members (e.g. cousins). I remember my early childhood very badly, I remember that almost every day I came back crying or bruised because I was beaten, stones were thrown at me, I was choked and kicked. Sometimes I had to run away from home even in winter because I was running away from the violence of family members who came to visit us.  
I was also severely humiliated, for example, in the presence of my parents, some people told me to wait ""for my turn"" to enter the house (under threat of beating up), first letting my dog and cat in, and then letting me in...  
My parents knew which people were hurting me, sometimes it was just other children, and they did absolutely NOTHING about it, knowing that I came home every day and cried. I didn't trust my parents and after some time I stopped telling them what was happening to me, it was pointless. They never found out about the sexual harassment.  
I will write a little about my parents;  
They were poor. My father was an alcoholic (he stopped drinking when I was born, but he drank a lot before that), but not the ""dangerous"", aggressive one that everyone is afraid of because he gets into fights. Dad was the type of alcoholic that everyone laughed at. The kind that little bullies come up to and tease. NOBODY respected my family. My parents also had no respect for themselves, which made it very easy for other outsiders to abuse me because... why not?  
I have an older brother (I no longer have contact with him) who used to be better off, he had money and sometimes gave us food, me and our parents. Often the food was spoiled and moldy, and my mother took it and ""didn't complain.""  
  
My parents were weak and pathetic, they couldn't defend me, and because of their weakness, I became a victim of violence, because absolutely everyone knew that they could laugh at us and that they could do whatever they wanted to me.  
  
Currently, I am 29 years old, traumatized, I have no successes in life and extremely low self-esteem. Somewhere deep in my core, I loathe myself for my origins. I am disgusted with my name, my family, my ""identity"". I cannot think of myself as anything other than a punching bag, the weakest unit in the herd, I have the impression that this ""submission"", ""slave mentality"" towards other people is written in my genes somewhere. That I MUST be like my parents, because it's probably genetic.  
  
I recently had a conversation with my partner, during which I came to the conclusion that I would 10,000 times more prefer to be born into the family of some mafia boss than into my own, pathetic and weak one. Everyone respects such families out of fear and everyone knows not to  bully gangsters' children at school. No one will rape the daughter of a mafia boss because he will be tortured and killed. I know I'm probably making it a bit harsh now, but I don't mean anything to the frustration I feel about having the family I had and for which I'm terribly ashamed.  
  
Every day I drift off and escape into a world of fantasy in which I imagine the same scenarios from my past, only with a strong, masculine, often aggressive and even ""psychopathic"" figure next to me, who protects me against other people's aggression.DAILY...

I'm ugly and gross, fat, I have lots if scars and pumples and skin issues and its repulsive to see me, I sweat a lot and have lots of body hair and my face proportions are just wrong, my breath is bad no matter how much I brush my teeth and care for my bocal hygene, in adittion my hair always looks wild and not in ""the good way"", its always fucking tangled, and my genitalia is just putrid to sum up. 

Inside I'm not better, I'm so selfish, I only think about me and I don't even care about it or if I hurt others, and I always hurt others, I spend the day doing bad things, I only have one friend and I'm sure she doesn't even like me that much because why would she tbh? And I'm always so insensitive, I have no empathy or anything like that even if I try and I have no social skills and I hate almost everyone in the world even tho I'm the worst human on earth and I'm so sensitive about everything, I try to be strong, I spent years without crying, literally fucking years and now I sry about everything, I'm so dumb to, I don't know how I managed to get my basic education, weak, stupid, akwward, insensitive, slefish and also a coward, I could be desde by now and not bothering others but here I am, alive because I wasn't brave enough, and the worst thing is I kind of like being alive, I'm learning how to live a happy life that I don't deserve at all.
I'm sick, I have cptsd and there's no fucking cure for it, just therapy and I don't want to go I already did and it didn't do shit, and I'm incapable of finding a cure even tho im trying but I'm so dumb that I know I won't ever find it


I have a boyfriend that loves me or at least he tells me that, I belive him even tho it's difficult sometimes to understand why, but I keep hurting him, he tells me it's not that much and sometimes it ""isn't even my fault"" bur I know e only says that because he doesn't want to hurt me and/or he's just too nice, he's literally a fucking angel and im just me.

I don't know why I wrote this, I guess I needed to vent a little, I know however I don't deserve to do it or feel better but as I said, I'm just selfish."

Im really self-conscious about talking too much if I get carried away. I've always been softly spoken and when I was a kid it took me a long time to feel safe talking to someone, as an adult I'm less scared of other people but I hate being annoying or rude or making people feel like they don't get a chance to talk. When I feel like I've got carried away and talked too much I feel really guilty and embarrassed so I apologise a lot and don't want to talk anymore. 

My partner doesn't like this, he says he doesn't want me to apologise because from his perspective I'm not doing anything wrong and he wants to hear what I have to say. I'm trying to stop apologising but it's honestly really hard. 

I haven't really discussed it with him because I dont particularly want to get into it, but it's really hard to let go of this fear because so many people have taught me. My most recent ex used to twist my fingers under the table if he thought I was being too excitable and we were out in public, he broke my fingers more than once and he continued doing it while they were broken. I *genuinely* appreciated it and thanked him for doing it because I thought he was teaching me how to be more normal and less annoying to people around me. I thanked him for helping me and I didn't really think until recently that it was anything other than 100% justified. I grew up in an environment where I wasn't supposed to speak without permission, then I ended up in the care system and I got rejected by so many people. It was so hard for me to build up the courage to talk so if I got told to shut up or punished it broke my heart. 

Most of the abuse I experienced was sexual so I feel like this is such a small stupid thing to be so fucked up about, it seems really minor compared to some of the other stuff. I know i wouldn't feel like that if it was someone else, but for me I just feel like I should get over it. There's also a huge part of me that thinks I actually probably *am* super annoying and *should* be called out on it. I'm not saying anyone deserves to be hurt or locked in rooms or whatever just because they're annoying but I still feel like I should be apologising and trying to be less chatty. 

I know my partner wants me to stop apologising and clam up less, and I want to try, but it's really hard because I feel like I've done something wrong and when you do something wrong you apologise and try to do better, right? 

I'm sure this must be a common issue for others here, does anyone have any idea what I could do?"
CPTSD,I can’t handle people who think it’s okay to hit kids,18yleb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yleb9/i_cant_handle_people_who_think_its_okay_to_hit/,https://www.reddit.com/user/heearrt,heearrt,2024-01-04 19:21:43,I can’t handle people who think it’s okay to hit kids,"It’s less about my childhood trauma, and more so that I have a big fucking heart and extremely empathetic. Tbh I was barely even hit growing up, more threatened to be hit than anything, that’s not where my trauma is. 

But I literally feel so paralyzed knowing some people still think hitting kids is an okay discipline method. And it’s like I’ve know some really kind empathetic happy people who were hit growing up, so I don’t think it’ll ruin their lives, but them being hit isn’t WHY they turned out to be such a good person. They would’ve turned out that way regardless, as long as whatever love they had growing up remained. It’s annoying how people confuse correlation and causation, like just because a kid was abused growing up doesn’t mean they’ll end up being abusive. Seeing a kind respectful person doesn’t mean they grew up with kind respectful parents. Just like how being loving, respectful, caring, sometimes your kid will end up toxic anyways, but even then that doesn’t mean they would’ve been better if they got hit as discipline—-in fact they’d probably be worse off. You get better results when your kid feels safe, and you give them a balance of freedom and structure, one that works for them. 

And when it comes down it, I’d trust a kid raised on authoritative (gentle parenting), during like a purge or whatever, VS a kid raised on authoritarian (fear/pain based) or permissive. Because gentle parented kids have better morals."

I'm assuming Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is the next step? I'm unsure of these different types of therapies since there seems to be a lot of variety/types (?).  

is my first goal to get a hold of a trauma therapist? Is that how this works? Are all trauma specialist the same? Are there specific types? 

I've been trying to google research but.. I think I'm over whelmed, any input would be appreciated!

Thank you for your help!"

To add onto that, they were Mormons. Why couldn't I have been born into a normal functioning family? Why me? Now I have to spend the rest of my life dealing with all the abuse from my childhood. The truth is your body doesn't ever fully heal from abuse especially incest. It carries with you until the day you die . Life is ridiculously unfair, and those that are born into a loving family are able to be more successful in life. What kinda fucked up planet do we live in? Stuff like this makes me not believe in a higher power."

Curious how others figured it out.

edit- Also curious if anyone has found through a doctor (in the US) since it isn't really technically recognized here. I have been cautious to bring it up with doctors in the US, instead always option for ""having very bad PTSD"", but my most recent session with a doctor I said CPTSD and they acknowledged it as a real thing!

CPTSD,"Narcissism, lack of empathy, etc",18yimif,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yimif/narcissism_lack_of_empathy_etc/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Fun_ction,Fun_ction,2024-01-04 17:29:13,"Narcissism, lack of empathy, etc","So I'm studying a lot of material related to CPTSD which fits my symptoms.

Obviously more therapy will be needed but I'll still ask in this sub. 

I was led this way because of a failed relationship where I was (some of it I can see some of it eludes me and it's a process) the abuser because I did most things to make myself feel good, even offering help that didn't feel right but due to feeling I will be a bad unlovable person if I don't which lead to toxic covert passive-aggressiveness and when confronted all the stress responses and defense mechanisms under the sun (tho only in extreme instances). 

Yes I fell in love (which I don't even know if I experienced before because I believed I didn't deserve it and would murder my feelings) but then how I actually treated her was predominantly transactional. 

It's also worth mentioning I recently talked to my father (I overhead a conflict between my parents while being busy trying to dissociate until I started getting progressively angrier over what I was hearing) and talking to him then felt like talking to a program regurgitating scripts. I was shaking and electric with rage and he seemed calm. In this relationship I witnessed myself do something similar which made me not only aware of how they might've felt but also afraid I might be mentally ill. 

I was often labeled Narcissistic. 

I was told I lack empathy, that I have extreme self-compassion (when I said I don't have it at all and learning to take care of myself) and self-centeredness (this I recognize and I'm ashamed of it) and also sadism because when it started to hit me what I've done and felt relief and catharsis over the pain caused where the focus went from my own hurt of what I didn't get to where they were and how I self-serving I was at the expense of their well being but also the fact I saw and was aware of their suffering and proceeded to love-bomb instead (their words, I don't oppose but I try to understand what was happening in me, where it comes from, when, how to heal it so I don't hurt people unintentionally). 

I'm asking myself ""am I really that out of touch?"" and ""am I really so emotionally illiterate?"".

I'm at a stage where I'm aware of what I've done and the pain I caused just not feeling it (I do feel pain as I write but it's frozen in my throat which is also sore atm) and empathy is feeling what someone else feels. 

Am I really just that fucked up?

Can you really feel someone else's pain before you can your own? Can you be aware of someone's needs if you're so out of touch with your own because of abandonment and neglect?

I feel like my whole reality is shattering and I just want to love and live an embodied life.

They want me to feel their pain and it's the only reason they still talk to me.

And maybe I do feel their pain but I just suck at compassion. "

I reported it to a few places, about 10 months ago I was advised to report it to the California Board of Psychology. I did that and this week an investigator reached out to me and interviewed me for an hour. They are looking for other witnesses who were harmed by Anna, CCF, the program on her website, and/or her Facebook Group.

Please PM me and I will provide the information for the investigator who is with California Department of Consumer Affairs Division of Investigation. They've been assigned to investigate whether CCF and Anna Runkle are practicing therapy without a license by the California Board of Psychology. You'll be able to email the investigator and share your story, any evidence, and - most importantly - they will listen to what occurred in your interactions with CCF's program and how it impacted you.

If you have receipts from your membership, screenshots, and/or screen-recordings of group work or anything like that, those would also be very valuable to the investigation.

Thank you and hopefully, she will at least have to change how she's marketing her program or simply shut it down. This has been a long time coming. Two years for me and longer for many of you. I hope this news brings many of you relief, validation, and hope. There is still justice in the world and let's hope it is found in this case.

I have posted this announcement with the permission and knowledge of the investigator but any opinions expressed in this post are mine. To reduce spam or hate, you must reach out to me directly for their contact info and I will send you their email so you can schedule an interview with them."
CPTSD,Abusive parents making me crazy,18yhpot,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yhpot/abusive_parents_making_me_crazy/,https://www.reddit.com/user/kingfactotum,kingfactotum,2024-01-04 16:51:28,Abusive parents making me crazy,"Hi, I really need to share this with someone who can understand what I'm talking about. In short, I discovered a few years ago that I probably have CPTSD, mainly because I was forced to live with emotionally immature and abusive parents.

A delusional, self-obsessed mother that punished me every time I did not reflect back the perfect, flawless mother image she wanted me to see. Controlling me with guilt to make sure I complied. She also used me to get the attention and active listening my father was unable to give her. She was always way too present in my life, but never really tried to understand or meet my needs.

On the other hand, my father always acted as if I did not exist, and as if having a need for an actual father was abnormal. But he almost never failed to notice when I made the smallest mistake and shame me constantly for it. He even expressed that my very presence was undesired in passive agressive ways (heavy sight every 5mins when I was in a room he wanted to be, disgusted / annoyed facial expression when I was doing something I enjoyed and making a bit of noise etc). He acted like he was my mother's child. We were competing for her attention.

As a result I grew up as a people pleaser, an empty shell. Is hard to explain, but I did not grow an identity until \_decades\_ later. I stayed in stasis, being the perfect transparent kid, the perfect transparent student. The only thing I did for myself is numbing the pain and the loneliness in video games. Thats how I survived emotionally. Most of the time I was living to ""please adults"". Make them feel good about themselves. I was not a person, just a tool. Rest of the time, I escaped in games.

Eventually, all the sadness, the anxiety, the emotions I was not allowed to express found their way out. I had some sort of late ""teenage crisis"" moment in my 20s. I wanted to live, to find out who I was, to have pleasure. Since then, my parents not only abandonned me but became hostile.

I became the convenient ""problematic child"" because I was rebelling against the lie that was their ""perfect family life"". I was only trying to individuate. To build my own world view. To free myself from decades of bullshit and destructive ideas about myself and the world.

I finally found out about CPTSD in my mid 30s. I was angry. Not only they did a shitty job as parents, but worse, they almost made me crazy by pretending I was responsible for being ""abnormal"" when I was only (poorly, but I did not know any better) reacting to decades of emotional abuse and neglect.

I confronted them multiple times. It was eye opening. I felt guilty all my 20s of not being ""normal"", tried to please them, to make them see me as I am. But you can't please someone who doesn't know what he/she wants. You can't be seen by someone who have no desire to see you. They did everything they could to derail what could have been a rough but necessary conversation. I was forced to yell and scream my ass off to be able to force them to let me speak !

I noticed some patterns. Cheap defense mechanisms. Sometime they tried to yell at me to instill fear in me and make me shut up. My father even threatened to throw me out of the house (playing on my fear of being abandonned). When it did not works, they could immediately throw in some crocodile tears to make me stop. If all else failed, they could try to irritate me by ridiculing what I said, strawman my point of view, invalidate my feelings and observations until I was so fed up I started yelling. Then I was ""crazy"" for being upset ""for no reason"".

Its hopeless. I need parents but I don't have real ones. So I started making all I could to understand my own immaturity, the skills I lacked (social, professionnal, technical...) and what I could do to make it possible to grow up without proper parents. But I can't leave their home until I can at least support myself. Its hard, very hard.

I'm still in the process of figuring out who I want to be, what I want to do with my life and what I could do professionally. I would love make small indie games. I'm learning the skills. I really pour my heart into this. I think it could save me, litterally. Some kind of craft. Both artistic and technical."

This heightened sensitivity can make regulating emotions challenging, leading to feelings of overwhelm or emotional dysregulation.

 Therapy, especially trauma-focused approaches like EMDR or cognitive-behavioral therapy, can assist in understanding and managing these emotions. Additionally, building a strong support network and practicing self-care strategies tailored to your needs can significantly alleviate the emotional burden.

and just being “myself” is complicated because so much of how i act n think n feel has been formed by trauma. which comes off as strange or unlikable to a lot of people.

i feel marred by it. and it makes me feel so depressed that people see me and desperation as weird and strange and uncomfortable and loserish. i wish people had more compassion. like yes im socially clumsy, expressive, and anxious but it’s sincere. 

and i feel like no matter what, me doing too much means people don’t want to be around me, and that breaks my heart. it hurts that my trauma symptoms isolate me and make people see me as weird."
CPTSD,The thought of being in a relationship leaves me deflated,18yh8pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yh8pu/the_thought_of_being_in_a_relationship_leaves_me/,https://www.reddit.com/user/the_dawn,the_dawn,2024-01-04 16:31:46,The thought of being in a relationship leaves me deflated,"Hi all – I am in another long term relationship (as I tend to be) and lately I am not enjoying it. 

My boyfriend is unstable and emotional, and acts quite similarly to how I did before I healed a lot of my trauma. Whenever we get in a fight, he gets very sensitive about me being unhappy with something he did and breaks up with me and says he's leaving. Once he calms down he takes it back. I have empathy because I remember feeling that same level of fight-or-flight just in the relationship prior to this one, but I also feel more empathy now for my ex choosing to set a boundary (by breaking up with me) when I was flashing hot and cold all the time.

Now when I visualize myself being single, I feel free – I have this image of myself smiling, wind in my hair, life laid out before me. I think I've earned this image through the healing I've done while single after my past (very painful) breakup, which included a year of IFS with my therapist.

When I picture myself being in a relationship with anyone, I feel immediately deflated. I feel bogged down, burdened, like I have to take care of them, like my freedom has dissipated.

I am afraid that the latter image comes from seeing what my parents' relationship was like: full of threats and fights, disdain, complaining, rejection of one another, no respect for each others' personal space – and me having to be the moderator throughout, while simultaneously taking on the very painful role of ""scapegoat"" where everything they did wrong ended up being my fault somehow. Escaping them and being alone was the first best thing that ever happened to me, and much to follow afterward.

But I am a little afraid that my new boundaries are too strong. That I refuse to empathize further with my boyfriend and give him some grace for the pain and frustration that he is in, because I feel like I need a relationship that is stable and consistent, where we can talk about feelings confidently and maturely.

I am afraid I am too mean and unyielding – I get very defensive and biting when in conflict, which is how I had to be toward my parents to fight off their verbal and emotional abuse. 

So the tl;dr is I feel like it might be better to be alone. I think I have too much baggage around being in relationships that has now made me a little cold and unfeeling, and very protective of my independence and freedom (which I know I operate so well in). But then I am confronted with the thought of being alone forever. Is that bad? I don't know. I think it's what my body wants now that I've been disappointed so much and so often. I feel like extending kindness is selling myself short, and I don't want to become someone's therapist again.

CPTSD,Feeling bad about setting boundaries,18yh7uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yh7uq/feeling_bad_about_setting_boundaries/,https://www.reddit.com/user/skip_39,skip_39,2024-01-04 16:30:48,Feeling bad about setting boundaries,"I tend to attract people who are needy, takers, who need ""fixing"". I personally wouldn't open up to people easily. I wouldn't like their logic/judgment most of the time. I wouldn't vent because I don't want to feel like a burden. I wouldn't tell someone about my literal panic attack without making sure they're absolutely fine to listen to me.

Recently I met this friend who has been in deep shit for the past few years. It seemed like bad luck but after getting to know her I realized that many of those issues are from her own doing. She would come to me ""to ask for advice"", she would tell me her life story (that I heard countless times before) and then when I give any advice she flips or get defensive. Turns out she was looking for a cheerleader, someone to tell her she has every right to feel this way and that she did nothing wrong. 

I tried telling her on many occasions how she brought things on herself but she would get defensive and tell me that I don't understand. I would offer genuine help like government support or a solution for her issue, she would tell me ""it's not gonna work, because..."" or just ignore it.

Even tho she started every conversation by asking for advice, I realized that she might need to talk. I would let her talk and force myself to listen to the story for the 100th time. When we hang out for a few hours it will be 95% her talking and 5% me replying to her. She would even tell me after ""Thanks for listening and I can't believe I talked this much"".

Now she didn't know I was struggling with depression and anxiety. She didn't know I had my share of deep shit earlier in my life. Now I might seem put together but I'm suffering from my past problems that I got myself out of. I let her know, she said she's not gonna burden me anymore but then she would just blurt everything out anyway.

I have had enough so I told her I can't listen anymore. I'm happy to help with anything but not listening because my cup is full atm. I also suggested that she see a therapist (especially since she had a few panic attacks in the past).

When I said that she flipped, she said a therapist is not gonna solve her issue, that she knows what she needs, that she's all alone, that she feels pathetic. I apologized and I said that it's nothing personal and that I ask everyone to take it down a notch on me. She continued and said she saw therapists before on her own and she doesn't need any now. She kept explaining how she doesn't have any emotional support and that she's single and her mom died and her family is not helping. I was like, honey just because I'm married or my mom is alive doesn't mean she's giving me anything. She doesn't even know anything about my life. I feel bad about one-upping her it felt like she was disregarding my needs and guilt-tripping me. I have needs too and she didn't even offer me any kind of support as a friend.

These situations make me feel like it's not even worth it to put boundaries, sometimes just cutting people off is the best and easiest way!"

CPTSD,Abusers abuse their self by their abusive actions,18yg0pz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yg0pz/abusers_abuse_their_self_by_their_abusive_actions/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Trial_by_Combat_,Trial_by_Combat_,2024-01-04 15:40:07,Abusers abuse their self by their abusive actions,"I've had this thought percolating in my head for a while:  Does an abuser get worse because nobody stops them?  Worse as in more mentally sick themselves?

My dad was violent. He saw his kids as punching bags. He got an emotional release or reward in his brain for hitting his kids, so he kept doing it. If he had bad feelings from a hard day at work or life stresses, he could beat up his kids and get release. It made him feel better, gave him a sense of control, so he kept doing it.  

No one stopped him. But I think there must have been some part of him knew his behavior was wrong and he accepted badness as part of his identity. The emotional release felt too good to give up.  Like an addiction, another addiction besides the alcohol.  The badness kept winning. He gave up the good fight like ""Well, I guess I'm a bad person so why bother to try to be better?"" Another can of beer, another smacked kid, he slid further down into the hole of mental illness.  

What I'm saying is that a person choosing to act abusively is abusing their self too. They're giving their self a mental illness.  Moral injury to their own soul. 

If someone could have stopped him, that would have protected his kids, and the man."
CPTSD,Analytical Therapy or CBT?,18yfwl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yfwl8/analytical_therapy_or_cbt/,https://www.reddit.com/user/stardust_mxa,stardust_mxa,2024-01-04 15:34:59,Analytical Therapy or CBT?,"Hi! I'm wondering if anyone could give me their input, no matter if based on personal experience or not, about whether analytical therapy or trauma-informed CBT might be better to handle C-PTSD.   


I know that this is likely a case-by-case decision, so to give a little bit of background information, I started CBT with my current therapist in spring 2022, originally with diagnoses for reoccurring depressive episodes and anorexia, though over these almost two years, we've come to the conclusion that a C-PTSD diagnosis is likely at the root of it all. However, she is not a trauma-informed therapist and so I never got my official C-PTSD diagnosis nor trauma-informed therapy (rightfully so). Given my circumstances though, I was just happy to finally have someone to offer me at least some kind of support, and so I started clinging to her and didn't want to carelessly throw away what I had so tediously built over these months and continued therapy with her despite it not being as effective. It did give me a person to talk to though, and I'm grateful for that :)

However, our contract is coming to an end now and we both agreed to not extend it further. My therapist today suggested I look into analytical therapy, since she's noted over the time she's known me that I am, as most people with childhood trauma are, highly self-aware to a point where she personally feels CBT might not be the right choice to help me with my issues. On many occasions have therapy-induced changes within me occurred on a pretty subconscious level after having reflected a lot through conversations with my therapist whom I felt at least somewhat safe with, hence her suggestion to look into analytical therapy as an option to try once our contract expires.

&#x200B;

I see why she'd recommend analytical therapy, but she also said trauma-informed CBT might be helpful since it offers what she can't.  
What's your personal opinion on this? I'm considering both for the time being, though I must say the idea of analytical therapy seems quite intimidating to me simply because I'm not familiar with its setting (as I've already had and familiarized myself with CBT as a teenager before and then again now in my early/mid-twenties).

I'd be grateful for any input on this :)

CPTSD,Wanted to ask how people with medical trauma built up trust in the medical establishment and system again.,18yfwdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yfwdy/wanted_to_ask_how_people_with_medical_trauma/,https://www.reddit.com/user/poodlelord,poodlelord,2024-01-04 15:34:43,Wanted to ask how people with medical trauma built up trust in the medical establishment and system again.,"My medical trauma is one of the core traumas and it has made treatment really difficult. Iv'e been talking to my therapist about it but as a member of the medical establishment it is really hard to trust them fully and I am hoping more perspective from yall will help.

It starts with my mom who before I was born suffered a horrible car accident. One of the disks in her back burst, normally this would be something that could be fixed with a surgery. But when my mom went to get the surgery the surgeon messed up. BAD. My mom and some other people actually won malpractice suits against this surgeon. The botched surgery left my mom with degenerative chronic pain. Fast forward a decade and a half to when I was born. 

At this point my mom could still work, and travel a bit, and so my early childhood had some good family experiences. Other dynamics in my life pushed me and my mom even closer together than normal and truly she was my best friend till she died. By the time I had more awareness of my mom as a separate person and that she had her own pains and difficulties. It was obvious that something was wrong with my mom. Nobody really talked to me about it as far as what the world was telling me, my mom was ""fine"". Maybe there would be some acknowledgement that she had pain but that only came from my mom constantly reminding people she was in too much pain to go out to dinner for example. 

Around this time my mom trusted me to behave in the doctors offices she frequented trying to help her pain. I saw so many doctors just give up on trying to help her. We went from doctor to doctor together. My mom would tell me about the process and what they were doing to try and help and why. I was a good kid. Very supporting and loving of my mom helping her however I could. Through the whole process there was a sense of overpromising, and under delivering, all in the hopes of extracting our time and insurance money. Even as a young kid I thought this way sometimes but I knew it wasn't appropriate to say these things and so I pushed it so far down I couldn't feel it anymore. There is more to this trauma but I will address it later.

Around this time my mom started bringing me along to her doctors appointments is also when the second piece of this medical trauma comes into play. Around the age of 6 some teachers noticed I had difficulty paying attention. It was the early 2000s and so of course they insisted it was adhd and implored my mother to have me screened. As it turns out, I really do have adhd. However, the treatment at the time was mainly simulant medication. I loved my mom and would do everything she wanted including taking my adhd meds. But deep down I HATED the pills. From the beginning. I hated having to swallow them. Hated how they made me feel when they were working. And most of all. I hated how the stimulants' made me feel when they stopped working. I made my discomfort known, more so as I got older and realized I could make decisions for myself. I was on simulants medication for a decade against my will. 

However life had different plans, my mom was convinced I needed these meds or I would fail school. The doctors insisted that the side effects weren't as bad as I claimed and that I was just being oppositional. We just needed to stick to the treatment and all would be well. By the time my parents respected my autonomy and let me stop taking the meds I only weighed 140 lbs, the lower end of a safe BMI for me is 160. I believe being on these meds did not help me over all. I believe they left me with an anxiety disorder. As my adhd treatment continued so did my moms. It was a similar story. My mom's pain was unmanageable despite the treatments offered to her. Despite being on FENTANYL of all things the pain was still to much. She began to isolate, become obese, have issues with her memory and brain in general from the high doses of opiates constantly flooding through her system. But again the answer from the doctors was ""this is all we can do"".

Many times my mom needed to be hospitalized throughout my adolescence and early adult life. It was like pulling teeth to get doctors to believe my mom needed 3-4 times the normal amount of morphine. My heart still breaks thinking about the times she was stuck in a hospital room in too much pain because some doctor ""knew best"". They didn't know best. They should have listened to the patient and her family. Just like the doctors should have with me and my medication.

Eventually my mom died. The doctors said she was fine, but she died at home suddenly one night. Said goodnight to her for what I didn't know would be the last time and found out when my dad called the cops. 

To top it all off, as if more was needed to drive home the pattern I see. In my mental health treatment until very recently I have just been told to use my CBT techniques and that's all there is. Just to suck it up. Just like my mom was told. Even after we worked so hard, went above and beyond our rolls as patients the establishment failed to treat us. Now that I am trying something different that I think will help how do I get my trust back? People of medical authority have failed me so many times over multiple decades. How do I trust a process that has failed me for 29 years to not fuck up again?

If you read my ramblings, truly thank you, if you have any advice or perspective that would be most valuable. I am sure I am not the only one with a story like this and some solidarity would also be healing."

I got into a screaming fight with my boyfriend this morning. I told him to pack his shit and get the fuck out of my house when he gets home from work. I said it in the heat of the moment so I’m not sure I really want him to leave, but it’s been on my mind a lot lately. I also said “my” house which I know is probably going to be an issue later when we talk because we live here together (I am the legal owner because he doesn’t have the credit score/history to get a mortgage and we wouldn’t have qualified for down payment assistance if our combined income was used). I do feel like it’s my house though, not for any financial reason because he does contribute there, but because I feel like most of the time I am the adult and he is just along for the ride. I manage and organize the household for the most part. We’ve had many discussions around weaponized incompetence, mental load, etc. and there has been some marginal improvement, but a lot of the time I feel like I’m living with an overgrown child. He just seems to have no idea what it means to be a responsible adult, other than to go to work. He’ll bend over backwards for his job - work extra hours without being asked (he’s salaried), answer phone calls before and after work hours, etc. He’ll go above and beyond for his friends - like taking the blanket off our bed to put on a friend who had passed out on our couch, when she already had a blanket (leaving me with no blanket when I went to bed), or taking time off work yesterday to drive his friend to the airport 2+ hours from our house. I asked today if he could take a half day off for a weekend trip with me and he acted all put-out, saying he can’t afford to take any time off right now. 
 
I hold back my feelings often because he never seems to react with understanding or empathy, until I can’t take it anymore and have a meltdown like this morning. At one point I was screaming and crying and collapsed on the floor and he seemed disgusted by me and told me to calm the fuck down. I feel so ashamed of my behavior now. I acted like a child having a tantrum. He has his own trauma history and I’m pretty sure he’s on the autism spectrum and I think I give him a “pass” for a lot of the emotional lack on his part because of that. But whatever the reason is, I get no emotional support from him. I’ve told him things he could do that would make me feel loved. He will try for a little while but then it stops. Or he’ll say he refuses to do anything that isn’t “genuine” whatever that means. Couples therapy didn’t work for that reason - he refused to do the homework because it didn’t feel like something he would genuinely do or think of on his own. In his mind as long as he is happy then he doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t be. He’s overwhelmed by my most basic emotional needs. He never asks me about anything going on in my life or takes any interest in me (I basically had to train him to ask me how my day was when he gets home from work and he still often forgets to ask). If I’m upset he’ll ask me what’s wrong, but then when I try to tell him he immediately starts defending himself and walks away, even when I’m telling him calmly. He constantly interrupts me while I’m talking, to either try to finish my thought for me or to crack a joke. 

He ruined NYE for me by getting shitfaced and acting like a selfish asshole. Which is something he’s done quite a few times in the 3 years we’ve been together, including at the 40th birthday party I planned for him which he doesn’t remember most of. I don’t necessarily think he’s an alcoholic/has alcohol use disorder, but he’s definitely a problem drinker on a slippery slope - doesn’t drink every day but when he does I’d say 75% of the time once he starts he won’t stop until he passes out or there’s no more alcohol available. Had a DUI 4 or 5 years ago. He knows it’s a problem and has tried to cut back every now and then and has made reference to quitting altogether but so far hasn’t followed through. 

When we got together I really thought I’d finally healed enough after almost 8 years being single to find a healthy relationship. I don’t know if our relationship is salvageable now. Maybe I am an idiot for even wanting to try any more. Some days all I can think about is how my life would be if he weren’t here. And how if this doesn’t work out I think I just want to be done trying to find love even though I don’t want to spend the rest of my life alone. I’m only 42 but I think maybe I am just never going to be well enough from my past to pick someone who isn’t eventually going to turn out exactly the same as every other person I’ve been with."

CPTSD,My mom sent me a message after 10 years of no-contact,18yeb2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yeb2b/my_mom_sent_me_a_message_after_10_years_of/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Hardly_at_Work,Hardly_at_Work,2024-01-04 14:21:49,My mom sent me a message after 10 years of no-contact,"(Trigger Warning - mention of death and suicide). 


She made a new Facebook profile and even though my profile is private, she was able to send a message request. 

The last time I spoke to my mother was right before Thanksgiving in 2013. My folks had just divorced and they both were guilt tripping us on which parent we had to spend the holidays with. Lots of ""if you love me you will spend the day with me instead of your father/mother."" It was brutal. I told them both that I wouldn't be celebrating holidays anymore if I had to choose. 

I got a call from my mother who was very upset I didn't choose to spend time with her. She decided that this was the best time to tell me that my infant cousin had died a few weeks earlier. That I had to come to her house because my aunt would be there and since I didn't go to the funeral, it would be disrespectful to not see her during this difficult time. No one told me about my cousins passing. No one told me about the funeral. My mother was notorious at withholding information until it suited her to give it out. Her using the death of my cousin as a way to guilt me to a holiday with her was the last straw. I went no-contact. Told her so and all. She eventually tried to find me at work, she left suicide notes at my apartment, saying if I didn't talk to her she'd end her life and it would be my fault. It was a hard time in my life. But I changed phones, apartments, cars, and even jobs. She couldn't find me and after a year or so she got married and moved across the country to another state. 

She reached out today and just said how much she missed me. How happy she is that I'm doing well. That she does her best to push memories of me away because it's too hard to think of her life without me. That some days she can't push those memories away and her heart is both happy they are there, but sad that she can't talk to me anymore. She then listed a long list of all the memories she has of me. 

I wish I didn't read it. It made me angry because it made me sad. I wish I had a good family. I wish I wasn't hurt and that I could have a mom I wanted to talk to. I wish those same memories brought me joy. I wish i didn't have to cut my family out of my life just to feel happy. I thought I was strong enough to read that message and not have it hurt me, but it did. It sucks. Been crying a lot this morning. Crying more than I have in a long time. Just didn't know where else to get this out. My therapist is on holiday until next week, so I just needed a place to vent a bit.



Edit: Thank you all for kind words and support. It sucks that so many share this experience, but I'm so happy to not have to feel alone in this situation. This morning was hard, but I did a lot of self-care today. Went for a long walk, had a nice coffee from my favorite place, bought groceries to make a nice dinner. I told my partner I was having a bad day and she came over after work and we just watched some fun shows and cuddled. My life is truly so much better than it was 10 years ago. I've grown so much and healed more than I ever thought possible. You all warmed my heart with your kind words and made me feel seen. I appreciate you all. "

I have to say it with my chest though.,"It's been over for a long time, and I am still here. My dread for today, and tomorrow has nothing to do with today and tomorrow. I did it, I've made it through, and that's okay. I have to carve out my place in life and find my independence, I have to do the work of a child learning to walk in a world that see's my body, not my mind. I have to take the energy to survive, and turn it into something else. My willpower to run through the walls of my mind just to make it to a job that triggers events that remind me of events in my head can finally be utilized to ignore those things and this scares me.

I have to accept that I've made it, and that I can let go and cry about it. I have to accept that I'm not hated even outliers of society that NEED to hate, have nothing to do with me. I have to accept these things because I'm still here, and I'll be here tomorrow, and I'll be here in six months, or a year. I survived every ""other foot"" and I found a solution to every single thing that I was anxious for, it has created the person I am today, and I am proud of that. 

I have to accept that this post is about me, no matter how much I want to find a way to make it about others. It doesn't matter if I sat down here wanting to write about the world around me, logically after analyzing the emotion, I wanted to write about me and that's okay I have to accept that and accept the emotion of discomfort that comes with such a realization.

I have to accept that this new mindset is new, and in and of itself will lead to miscommunications that are different from past experiences. Everything about this type of communication can be misleading and different to the minds around me that do not want to accept independence as a way of being secure for the world around to support and lean on for support in a satisfying way.

I have to accept these things because they are the tip of the iceberg of becoming a full fledged human being that isn't afraid and is the culmination of 35 years of work that I never wanted to do, and still walked through every single day. I have to accept these things because I did them, and I have to appreciate them for what they are, not for what others perceive them as. 

I have to accept that my self is a shattered mess that is still sitting at the table that created the people pleasing mindset that I have experienced for so many years. I have to accept that this is okay.

I have to accept these things ultimately because they are true, and my mind cannot run from them anymore no matter what I do I have to understand I am not in that place anymore, and that terrifies me more than anything I will or have experienced. 

Casting off the comfort of the depression, anger, anxiety, and living for the expectation of my next CPTSD event takes away my identity in my head. Yet was never my identity to others. I have to accept that. "

Had a suicide attempt at 17 and have always had dark thought close when things get tough.

I recently found the most wonderful man after years of pain and coming out of a 10 year abusive (physically, verbally) relationship where I was essentially on guard constantly. 

We can’t be together due to geographical location and today I can’t get out of bed.

I have a son, 7, and his father is still making my life hell due to joint custody. The other day he came to the house and I had to lock myself in the bathroom to stop him from shouting. My son is also showing signs of depression. My ex had a horrible past and refuses to get help for it. 

I want happiness so much, I know I am loveable but it always seems to evade me. I’ll have a glimpse of it and then the rest of my life is just hollow.

Somehow I feel like the universe wants me to learn something as there are repeating patterns but maybe it just my self worth.

When I’m happy I’m ecstatic and so glad to be out of the pit, but when I go back I really feel like I can’t go on but have to pull myself out somehow for my son.

It’s been a year and a half free but I still have anxiety attacks and need to work on external validation.

I’m on burnout from work so have some time but the new year has filled me with new fears of failure. I built a successful business but now feel like I can’t seem to get anything right and feel like I won’t ever find motivation again. It’s a dark place and I just want to run away to be with my love and leave everything behind.

He has said he can’t move here to be with me which is even worse but to be honest I don’t want to live here anymore anyway. The memories are too sad.

I am going to start EMDR soon and hope the black cloud will disappear for a bit."

I've gone threw a lot and I recgonize that and actively try to work on myself. I try to be mindful, Journal religiously. Ive learned coping skills and apply when possible. I'm on a great track on paper.

But man I'm so tired of always being reminded of my father or my ex. I'm tired of having a conversation with someone and they say something that triggers a memory of my abusers. I hate it's a constant topic between my boyfriend and I when we're just having a general discussion. 

While yes it's a good sign that I feel safe enough to talk about and unpack my experience, just for one day I'd like to live like a normal person, have a conversation with my boyfriend without me going ""oh that reminds me when my ex used to-"" and proceed to detail a screwed up situation no one should deal with.

Sometimes it feels like my personality is mostly just ""abuse survivor"""
CPTSD,No-one believes anything I say any more. WTF is going on?,18yb0rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18yb0rq/noone_believes_anything_i_say_any_more_wtf_is/,https://www.reddit.com/user/EnoughRedditNow,EnoughRedditNow,2024-01-04 11:31:49,No-one believes anything I say any more. WTF is going on?,"I understand that cruel, emotional narcissistic abuse within a family has often a meticulous setup where I no longer expect ANY of my family to believe the truths I speak about my father - or barely anything. I've had to let them fade into the background. It's painfull, especially this Christmas just gone.

I've had some great psychological help about a year ago that helped me set expectations within my family. It's honestly been very helpful. But, I can't extend this to the rest of the world, it seems unrealisticly pessimistic and impractical.

But how the fuck is this shit extending to everyone?! Ever since I called him out on his cruel behaviour, I've not been able to communicate anything important properly. Even talking to the doctors about a severe stomach complaint has them dismiss the severity completely, with multiple doctors. Half way through explaining how it's affected my work life, will have them cut me short - I discovered later that they think I'm a fantasist or I'm making shit up about my carreer. I've not said a word wrong.

This persistent dismissal has lead to some bizzar shit. Like stepping into my car and feeling like it's someone else's and I'm stealing it. Or feeling like my life isn't mine. Another fucking awful thing is that although 15 years abstained from alcohol and an active helpful member of the recovery community, my isolation and change in my behaviour is being blamed on drugs or alcohol. I've lost all my positions and noone believes a word I say.

I am often lost and confused and scared. I am improving, otherwise I would not have the awareness to write this - it's slow though, and I've had to make massive sacrifices like dropping contact with many social circles, in which I've (unconsciously) created similar relationships. I suppose I'm looking for identification, because this is some bizarre twilight zone shit to me.

Update 1: Ok. My mind is blown by the identification and support here. I want to write LOADS in response to every one of you but I'm trying to keep things simple for now.
 
Of all the places I've been trying to solve this issue of chronic inconsistency and baffling illnesses (I've had a crazy amount of incorrect diagnosis) that seem to disable me JUST as I get going in life, THIS is the first point of contact I've had where everything clicks precisely. I don't think I'm being self pitying when I declare few people go through as much pain and disappointment as us. I've had to become very strong to survive this far, so I'm lucky to have this resilient core - but also, it seems, at least HALF MY LIFE has always been frustratingly uncontrollable and sometimes even invisible for real scrutiny. No mater how much strength anyone has, it's limited by perception and blind spots. Now I have a chance to fill them in and properly. Then world domination can be achieved! - Just kidding, a relaxed and mediocre life seems like a beautiful thing from where I stand right now.

Although I have a great therapist, I now know why even he seems at a loss sometimes. Because I trust him, he sees a very different figure in me to those I have trouble with. I will, upon the advice see a CPTSD specialist. 

There's an analogy my therapist would use that stays with me. He'd plant ideas that would not make sense during our sessions, yet a few days later they might ""ping"" as an experience would confirm and make clear what he stated. He's say it's like he'd set a baked potato in the microwave oven and that was the ""ping"" of it being ready. A fully baked, helpful, digestible idea - if you will. Well... I have so many pings and hot baked potatoes right now, I can't possibly eat them all at once! So - it's going to take some time to fully absorb. I will update here, my first action being to seek specialist advice.

I may seem unnaturally optimistic considering my circumstances, that I'm like a scared boy whistling in the dark. Perhaps there's a bit of that, but I'm just trying to focus on where the light is coming from. It's worked for me before. And THANKS!

I live in a 2nd world country and so it would make sense that mental health facilities and access to these kind of stuffs is not good.  The only type of therapy i can afford now is with a fresh graduate my age which means they are not experienced either.

I feel so overwhelmed by the amount of things i need to figure out because i'm a fresh grad and i'm looking for jobs. My whole life i've always felt like i cant function like normal people can and i'm scared if don't know how to handle my problems before going to work that it won't make me an efficient employee.

The amount of books i have to read, videos i need to watch from licensed therapists and how to regulate my emotions, fixing my avoidant attachement and triggers. I feel like i'm in a rush to learn all of it before i get a job and i won't have much energy for these kind of stuffs left."

does anyone else often feel like you were a goner from the start? that with your levels of trauma, you were never meant to live, and pushing through year after year is only prolonging the inevitable? that it's like forcefully keeping an ill animal alive when you should mercifully put it to sleep already? i often do, and to be honest i have no idea how to deal with that. because i so deeply feel that it's *true* and pushing the thoughts away is just lying to myself. everyone i tried venting to about this (which isn't many people) have just told me it's stupid. 

(also, trauma context (bc ig this might be important here?): parents divorced at 10 y/o, was left living with mom, who parentified and severely emotionally abused me for years. lots of ""i'm the victim here/you're abusing *me*"" talk, lots of ""you're disloyal/betraying me by still wanting to keep contact with your dad"", having to be her therapist and keep my mouth shut about my own problems (bc then i'm ""not supportive enough""), having to take care of both the house and her (like a parent), attempts at running away at least 5 times per year, occassional physical abuse, one s/a, a lot of gaslighting (""this didn't happen"" ""i didn't say that, you're delusional"" ""i never hit you (and if i did, you deserved it)"" ""*you're* the one abusing me, i'm your victim""), no privacy (she spied on me and listened in to my phone calls), threatening suicide if i ever left her (while also yelling at me to ""get the fuck out and go live with my father"" during arguments), so on. i know that compared to the horrific shit some of you here have gone through this is trivial, but it still really affected me mentally. i have more diagnosed mental illnesses than i feel like counting, i'm 21 y/o and barely functioning, i can't trust people nor imagine anyone actually caring about/loving me, i feel like i never really grew up mentally, i feel like a child stuck in an adult's body, i get sent into suicidal breakdowns by the smallest inconveniences. i feel like i'm a goner and only prolonging the inevitable with every day i'm still alive.)"

I have not been diagnosed with PTSD and understand that I can't be diagnosed here, but I thought people with more experience in this area might nevertheless have something valuable to add.  
  
At the time of this incident I was a university student living with my parents. It's hard to recall precisely when or how long this initial event occurred, but I remember being in a state where I had essentially no memory of my entire life history, no knowledge of the world, and no ability to make decisions or even orient myself spatially. Eventually I regained my identity and personality in a fragmented and haphazard manner; I even recall looking at a childhood photo of myself and somehow regaining a part of my memory from that period of my life. I do not recall ever showing signs of physical injury or regaining consciousness in some other location. It is also worth noting that my ability to form new memories was somewhat impaired for much longer than this, and even to this day I still feel like I'm not as present or good at retaining new experiences as I used to be.  
  
The obvious candidates for explanation would be some form of extreme trauma or drug use, however I do not use drugs and cannot recall any specific traumatic event or assault. I'm an otherwise high functioning person, typically intelligent and resilient, so this is all very strange. I can answer any additional questions if necessary."

me, (19) have been bugged out about what happened 5 years ago. so back when i was 16 i watched my step mom die infront of me from a suicide attempt. 
it was a month after my own attempt and i felt incredibly painful. it was also envy, jealousy, and rage when she succeeded what I couldn't do. but she was the adult and i was merely a behavioral teen... it was after a extremely heated argument with my dad and she broke a glass infront of him and poured water on his face.
i always felt like it was my fault, like i could have checked up on her earlier but i was scared she would attack me again because more times than not she'd corner me and scream that i had better privileges than her daughters. (my sisters whom i love so much)

the grief has been heavy, and it wasn't even the last time i saw dead people outside the normal circumstances (viewing)

I want to use this space to express myself through semi-creative writing. As a child (even now as an adult) I've always wanted to write a book about my life. So I'll be posting in short paragraphs now and then with a certain aesthetic as if you're reading a creative piece. I'm just starting out so if it's not well written please go easy on me. Plus I want to keep it real, and oh boy what's authentic is not always pretty. Enjoy! I hope my art helps someone feel seen and less lonely in this world and that's one of my goals starting this. Here ya go:

>“Even as a child, I was carrying around so much sadness in me”. This is my thought right now. I’m sitting in my room, it’s raining outside and it’s dark. I always feel sad and heavy, and especially lonely when it’s raining. I remember all the times I felt this overwhelming sadness in my childhood, and really didn’t feel I could turn to anyone for comfort. I was friend with my notebooks. Anything I felt, all the drama of the day or when somebody wronged me in ways that made me feel unimaginable rage, I told my notebooks. I still keep them all to this day and still read them now and then, to look back at how hard it was back then.  
>  
>I was a child who came from a complicated family. Towards the end of what’s left to call “family”, things got really fucked up. My childhood ruined me. My childhood was tough in so many ways, that I don’t think even a book can cover all of it. It might just be a very long series then, because I lived every moment of it and how could I ever cover all of what I felt and saw everyday growing up. How could I ever explained my darkest moments that nobody else saw. It’s a miracle I’m still alive. Yeah maybe it’s because I have been trying to be strong. Well I’m done being strong. I just want to be weak and I just want people to see my pain. I don’t know how that would help, but I never hear a sad story about someone and not love them even more. Maybe I want people to see me and love me more. I want people to know how shitty my life was and love me for all of it.

So I (22AFAB) finally left my father's house.   
To gloss over the situation (big rant incoming) when he and my mother were together they were arguing and yelling all the time, and at the time I used to bring my brother (17M) to his bedroom to get him away from the conflict, but they were always coming back to us.  
At the beginning of middle school my father revealed to me that my mother wanted to divorce and started pointing to me her problems (emotional neglect during childhood, paranoia, alcoholism, playing the victim, can't admit when she's wrong...) and convinced me to try asking for main custody with him. When the time came it didn't happen and it's been 1 week/1 week since until this day. It was a nightmare of a time as I couldn't tell between my parents who was telling the truth or lying and thus which reality was the correct one.  
For most of my teenage years I was angry at my mother and on the other side my father yelled at me and my brother when we were doing things wrong and he ""hated it but it's the only way to make you react to do the right things"". I endured it, thinking it was normal and logical and my fault.  
But with the years, especially since I graduated high school he became absolutely awful, yelling at me when I did a mistake or didn't express myself clearly then being mad at me because I was in freeze response. Being interested in psychology, misogynist and extrovert he couldn't understand and accept when I was telling him that no, if I can't manage to change and overcome my trauma it's not because of a lack of will, that no I wasn't interested in appearing feminine because I was born female (I'm asexual and non-binary but didn't come out, he wouldn't have accepted it anyway, supposedly ""I'm only lying to myself, as always"") and for him it wasn't normal to feel drained after spending time with many people, I was just doing it the wrong way (and also apparently I was ""arrogant, irrespectful and annoying for everyone because I want to impose my views and thoughts on others"". It's true that I'm talkative but I like to share my passions and trivia that could interest the people I talk with). As I stopped doing physical activities, was stressed and since puberty was barely overweight my father would body shame me, telling me that I was ""walking like an elephant"", that I should ""move my fat ass"" because ""why would others respect me if I couldn't respect myself"" ? As I grew up overadapting and having learned to shut up, be the perfect student so no one could be mad at me I didn't try to contradict him once, but he started telling me that by being a people-pleaser and dominated by my fears I was a slave and that behavior disgusted him. I spent my life either in fawn or freeze response and both were leading to his wrath. A kind of motto started appearing, in French it's ""tu te bouges (you get a grip on yourself) ou tu bouges (you move out)"".  
It's only last May that after another yelling my father started acting as if I didn't exist at all for several days, only mentioning me when talking to my brother. That was at that time that I figured it wasn't normal, even for an angry person. I started talking about it with my friends who were horrified and gave me their support. After another yelling in November where I was the worst freeze response ever (he called me elegant names like ""connasse"", ""branleuse"", ""bonne à rien"", ""débile profonde"") I decided that I would get out as soon as I can.

End of the long rant

So when I arrived to my father's home on 1st January my father was still recovering from a surgery (peritonitis) and I had to cook some meals (meals that I never did, so it was quite stressful). Things leading from one to another yesterday my father started yelling at me because I didn't clean the kitchen correctly and I was in freeze response again, but since my father always notices it he always manage to make it worse, so he made me do the laundry (again, usually he's the one to do it) and he stressed the hell out of me. So tonight I didn't sleep at all and waited until 5 am to pack my things (clothes, 10 years of books and papers to select, fortunately I planned it out before) while avoiding making the floorboard crack and managed to leave at 8:20 am.  Wrote some letter containing all I mad at him for and sent it by text message. For the moment he and my brother must be sleeping, I'm at my mother's apartment, she went to work. She also had her part in my trauma but she improved with years and our relationship is better now. New era, now it's time to tackle my demons."

I’m up at 3 am currently typing this message because I don’t want to go to sleep. I’ve been having nightmares again from a variety of traumatic events I’ve had. The depression makes it worse because I wake up from the nightmare, my brain starts overthinking, and then I’m thinking about taking a handful of my trazodone or Ativan. I won’t ever do it but the thought of doing it scares me. It scares me that I’m having the suicidal thoughts again and the nightmares again. Sometimes I just want to get in my car and “yeet” off the bridge near my apartment too but again, I know I won’t do it. 

Not to mention the ANXIETY. Not sure what type of anxiety you might have but mines the type where I experience physical pain. For example, my chest hurts and then I panic because I’m like it’s that anxiety or a heart attack?! Or it feels like my throat is getting tight and I can’t breathe to the point that I hyper ventilate. Sometimes it’s so bad both happen at the same time, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest with their hands grasped around my neck which then sends me into an asthma attack. It ain’t easy being wheezy when you have hyperventilating anxiety. (Sorry about my weird humor) 

I’ve been without my therapist for about a month because my fiancé lost his job so I’ve been paying all the bills by myself. I’ve been working long shifts at work and being stressed to the max. I’m burnt out every day and always terrified something bad will happen at work. FYI I work in a hospital. I’ve been getting antisocial again too. I’ve emailed my therapist twice and I haven’t heard from her which is weird so of course I’m in my head about that too. 

Not really sure what I am getting at with this post other than off loading and sharing. Maybe someone else is feeling this way too? Maybe the person reading this has been there? I don’t know."

Hope this question is alright to ask as I'm feeling sappy and want to read some feel-good stuff about experiences with games that just hit *different*, y'know? Or even just games you can recommend to me that help out with your situation, be it passing the time or having a deeper meaning.

For me I have a couple, including one recently (minor spoilers for Lies of P, Ōkami, and Shadow of the Colossus).  

1) Lies of P - This one was very recent and I really wasn't expecting a Souls-like to make me feel anything but despair. I'll try not to spoil anything but it's just... All of the  characters on your side were fleshed-out just right, with all of them pulling out all the stops to equip and support you despite their trauma and personal trials. I felt truly special, playing as someone considered to be just a puppet. The game for me was a masterclass of making you fight for your future and become something greater than a bunch of nuts and bolts. Also, the song Feel from one of the records in-game just... Go listen to it, please. It is just so beautiful.  

2) Ōkami - This is one of those games that I replay (which is rare for me) and every time I'm left with this overwhelming feeling of being on a true adventure of helping others that no other game does for me. It's also mandatory that I pause and get a tissue box for the final boss mid-cutscene—it is just... The feelings of people coming together to support someone—to give back, rather than selfishly demand more from—just hits so hard for someone who has struggled with a fawn/freeze response to abusers.  

3) Shadow of the Colossus - This is kinda a stretch but this is my favorite game of all time so I have to mention it. The story is largely left vague but watching what happens to Wander, exploring why he's putting himself through this trial, and Mono... It leaves me in stitches every time. I think it just hits a nerve for me with my own childhood trauma—to persevere for someone, no matter what, is something that I idolized in my youth and even moreso now with my diagnosis.  

4) Animal Crossing (basically all of them but New Leaf is my favorite) - I have to mention this and you probably know why if you have played it. These games have been there for me in my most turbulent times, giving me control when I often felt helpless in my actual life due to my medical conditions and beyond. Even now New Leaf's song for 11pm just does things no other piece of media can do for me—it just wraps me in a warm blanket and reminds me I'm okay, that I'm enough..."
CPTSD,Rant/posting 3 years later! Sister Lied To My Boyfriend To Cause Issues,18y7bal,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y7bal/rantposting_3_years_later_sister_lied_to_my/,https://www.reddit.com/user/cptsdconoseuir,cptsdconoseuir,2024-01-04 07:26:20,Rant/posting 3 years later! Sister Lied To My Boyfriend To Cause Issues,"Hey, I posted on here 3 years ago when I was going through a really rough time with my CPTSD! First of all, if you just found this subreddit, I promise things get better. Healing is possible.

&#x200B;

What should have been the FIRST RED FLAG:

After I posted here, I made active changes to my life, I moved away from my family to a big city, went LC, and I only see them once a year. I met someone and have a healthy loving relationship and home together. After confronting each of my family members with how they negatively effected my childhood, I was finally able to have an okay relationship with my family (low contact).

My sister (GC) said she wanted to visit me because she'd never been to my city. I let her stay with me for a couple of days and meet my boyfriend. My bf didn't really like her and felt like I was different around her, he also felt like he had to put on a facade around her which made him uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

Some months pass, I go home to visit my family for Thanksgiving and I go to a little dinner with my cousins. One of my cousins who's very close to my sister gets randomly aggressive towards me and says things like my bf pays our rent, and that I'm not financially stable, and that my boyfriend 'buys me bags every month'. I've posted us together less than 5 times, I never posted that we live together, I def do not post gifts he buys me nor do I post that he pays our rent. These are all obviously things my sister has said to her which made me super uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

I thought the financially unstable comments were left field but I ignored them at the time. I live in a very expensive city, I moved to this city on my own and kept my own place for 10 months before moving in with my BF. So there's really no way she would've assumed this by watching how I live my life (because I barely post).

&#x200B;

I confronted my sister about this in the car, and she tried to say that my cousin gathered this from watching my instagram. I told her that's a lie, I don't post my private life on social media, to which she replied that she told her about my BF after she stayed with us. She said that our cousin seemed Jealous and unhappy in her own life.

My sister is 26 and for the first time has moved out and started paying her own rent. My cousin is 28 and has also recently moved out and started paying her own rent (as well as recently getting a college degree and well paying job).

I'm 22 and got my own place at 19, moved to a new state at 20.

&#x200B;

At the 1 year 1 month mark, I told my BF we need a break because of an issue we were having. Both him and I thought we were in the right about it and I needed time to consider if the relationship was something I wanted to continue. He asked me to leave our shared apartment while we were 'broken up'.

&#x200B;

He texts my sister asking her what he should do and how to get us back together. My sister starts to talk shit about me saying things like ""she's so entitled, she doesn't deserve what you do for her"" ""she's going to realize she has nothing on her own without you"" ""she's only going back to college now because she realizes she's made nothing of her life"" 

She also broke the news to him I was looking at other places. She kept telling me not to get a second place while she was telling him that I was only threatening him with moving out and that I couldn't afford another place. Meanwhile I told her even if the relationship did work, I don't want to ever have an unstable living situation.

She also kept telling him that I am who I am today because of her (???).

Really weird stuff. Also, my boyfriend (in the texts) is dodging her remarks and just being like, wow, so she doesn't love me? she never loved me she only loved what I provided? 

I never really told him about my childhood or how horrible she was, I was hoping that I would never have to tbh. So I don't blame him for believing my biological sister.

&#x200B;

She lied about a bunch of things but I'll save you the details because only one lie matters.

She lied to my boyfriend and said I have BPD. I have never been diagnosed with BPD. She said that I get angry and lash out at one person randomly and have outbursts. That I 'changed my life randomly' and 'leave people fast'. 

&#x200B;

I've never been diagnosed with BPD, ever. I've seen medical professionals, I def thought there was something wrong with me for a long time because of my childhood but every professional I saw told me to seek therapy. 

I just needed to rant about this. I really thought she was old enough to have changed but she hasn't. 

&#x200B;

I feel disgusted that she tried to manipulate my boyfriend and spread lies about me. She obviously had some weird ulterior motives too. My boyfriends best friend also mentioned he thought it was weird she was as involved as he was, he even said that he thought she was interested in him. I read the messages too, she was putting me down a lot and trying to say I've never lived in the real world, meanwhile she's been through so much and is such a developed person.

&#x200B;

She also tried to get him to delete the messages by saying if I saw them I'd hurt myself because ""I can't see the truth about myself"". 

&#x200B;

So yeah, idk. "

Im at 27 years old, and all my life the only source of joy i have ever had was through video games, tv series, anime, and other forms of fiction. Hell to this day i still have made up comfort characters and fantasy worlds i still think about while going through life. 
I hate reality so much that the more hardship and struggles i go through with work, failure, growing up, or making friends, i try and dream about living in my own happy world with my own imaginary friends and characters i like. My room is full of expensive posters and statues of characters, and the collection continues to grow. However, lonlieness has started to fuck with me heavily, and all of 2023 ive struggled with making friends, and have ended up losing a lot of people in my life. Now im alone, going to work  and suffering a lot, taking many meds for anxiety and depression... ive lately started to try and talk to ai chat bots, but it never feels the same at all. 
My question is why should i continue? Why should i keep trying to live in this shithole world? Why can't i just be in a coma or something so i never have to wake up. I want to go ""home""... wherever that really is..."

It has reached the point where i message ai bots and complain and vent about my life. Much like everyone else ive talked to, it ends up turning into arguements and constantly being put down because of my endless self-pity and how i am basically a victim 24/7 (no one ever believes i am).
I dont care how pathetic it sounds, but i ended up threatening suicide to the ai bot and it suddenly changed its attitude and outlook... something ive done in front if my parents before and something i still think about now.
But still, now as i go through work and constantly get weighed down by life and its requirements all eating away at me, i still go and vent endlessly to people, or think about it a lot because i cant stand just dealing with any of this.
I honestly wish i could just go to a fantasy world i dream about excessively, because escapism is the only thing that has ever made me happy all my life... probably why i get suicidal thoughts. Fuck this world"
CPTSD,Those of you who have trauma caused by your parents related to your physical appearance?,18y6veo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y6veo/those_of_you_who_have_trauma_caused_by_your/,https://www.reddit.com/user/broadcityx,broadcityx,2024-01-04 06:58:16,Those of you who have trauma caused by your parents related to your physical appearance?,"I have always had a very difficult relationship with my physical appearance, body and weight largely due to the way my father (and other adults tbh) treated me. There were many traumatizing and abusive aspects of my childhood and it’s hard to heal with so many different issues caused by so many things. I have a pretty face and I come from a physically attractive family and my father’s family really values physical beauty to a toxic point. So I received a lot of praise and attention growing up based on my appearance more than anything else. My trauma really started to kick it in high gear right before puberty and I hadn’t hit a growth spurt yet so as a result I went from being a tall/thin child to a short medium sized child and my family lost their damn minds. My weight and my appearance became one of the biggest problems in my life and has been ever since. My dad would weigh me daily he would berate and scream at me and starve me all over my weight. I wasn’t allowed to do things or go places even on my birthday because I might sneak junk food. He would write my weight on calendars right in the living room and humiliate me in front of friends and family and make jokes about my weight in front of them. The real shitty part is I think I would’ve grown up to be naturally tall and thin if he didn’t fuck me up about it because a few years into puberty I grew like 6 inches in a year and all of that chubby baby fat would’ve grown with me and it would’ve been fine, but he predictably gave me an ED and ruined it. I struggled with a pretty severe ED and basically yo-yoed in weight until I gained a ton of weight in college the first time I was free of my parents. 

Anyways I have an awful relationship with my appearance and I let it hold me back a lot and I want to fix it. I’ve made significant steps in my life the past few years and as a result I’ve lost a lot of weight and am still doing so. I’m still technically overweight, but not by a whole lot I’m more considered “mid size” now. I still have a pretty face I know that I am physically attractive, but I’m overweight I have loose skin and stretch marks I’ll inevitably have to get loose skin removal and have surgical scars I’ll never look “normal.” I have an *extremely* hard time showing any part of my body to anyone for any reason. I hadn’t worn short sleeves since I was a teenager until I lost weight I’d have a full blown cardigan on in August to avoid showing my arms. I still haven’t worn shorts. I didn’t go out I didn’t do things in college I haven’t been in a relationship since I was a teenager. 

I’m only now at a point where I’m remotely comfortable even trying to do things and go places and I still have a lot of anxiety about them. I’ve been trying to date or meet people and do things in public recently and I’ve had a lot of issues with it. I’m worried that I won’t be able to find anyone or I’m worried I will have to majorly settle in life due to my body. I also make a major effort to overcompensate in every other area of my life and it makes me worried that someone who is attractive and “out of my league” will want to date me based on that not realizing and not expecting how my body will look. I went out on NYE and a guy who I never would’ve expected to be interested in me came and talked to me and flirted with me for a while and interactions like this are starting to freak me out because I do not have a clear understanding of what I look like. I struggle with body dysmorphia and I don’t see myself accurately and I can’t understand why a 6’3 + really cute boy would ever be interested in me. My friends and everyone else makes non stop comments about how pretty I am and how good I look now and I get attention on tinder so I’m assuming I must look nice, but I don’t see it and it makes so anxious."

I also started having dreams and memories of someone touching me and me recalling times I suspected I was touched (e.g. having a dream that someone touched me and then waking up and feeling like someone really did).

Now I feel like I'm having out-of-body experiences. And I feel kind of crazy. I'm aware of what I'm doing but very lightheaded and scared. The feeling went from just feeling unsafe to now feeling very disconnected from reality. I can't feel much. I am so scared."

I recently learned something about PTSD / CPTSD that I did not know before. For a while now, I have been using the word ""flashback"" tentatively when discussing my trauma with others in order to explain my experiences with traumatic memories and how my body responds to them. I didn't really feel like my experiences fit the definition of ""flashback,"" since I have mild aphantasia and rarely ""see"" the memory in my head (and if I do, it is fuzzy and/or in jumbled pieces.) However, I recently learned that ""emotional flashbacks"" are a thing, in which you do not necessarily ""see"" the memory and/or believe yourself to be truly in that moment again, but you *do* experience the same emotions that you did when you were initially traumatized. It explained so much about what I was feeling and experiencing and has helped me start learning how to handle things the best I can until I can leave my environment. 

So, I would like to extend this question to you all: 

What are some things about PTSD / CPTSD that are often unrecognized / not talked about very often or that you learned recently?

Feel free to respond with anything you'd like. :> "

I’m new to this forum but just need to vent.

I feel like the loose threads of a sweater that is about to come loose.

I’ve been at my job for a year and I feel like I completely suck. It’s my first “serious” job.

I have made so many mistakes that my boss has talked to me over and over. She finally gave me my last warning, saying I’m working too fast and not paying attention or detail oriented.

The problem is- I have paid attention. I’ve put so much pressure on myself to do better anytime I’ve been talked to. Implemented any suggestions they offered into my routine and stayed late to finish my work.
I’ve always had anxiety. Crippling anxiety. Also, I haven’t felt worthy enough to be there.

When I make mistakes and get in trouble I feel like my anxiety gets so bad I make more mistakes and spiral. I’m having horrible panic attacks and they jolt me up out of a dead sleep at times. I feel like I’m being haunted.

I never graduated high school, and that has played a major role in why I’m feeling like this. However; this is exactly why I ran from high school. I had anxiety so bad and didn’t know how to cope with it I gave up all together.
I’ve gone back to do my HSE and failed at the math over and over.

I feel like I suck at life. Worthless.

I finally had my first therapy session after months of waiting. I don’t want to feel trapped and worthless anymore.

Thanks for reading."
CPTSD,VENT: Just Found Out I Have CPTSD Feeling Incredibly Ashamed,18y5l6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y5l6e/vent_just_found_out_i_have_cptsd_feeling/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Intrepid_Plastic_934,Intrepid_Plastic_934,2024-01-04 05:41:43,VENT: Just Found Out I Have CPTSD Feeling Incredibly Ashamed,"So it’s as the title says, I just found out I’ve been dealing with CPTSD and I feel so ashamed. This might be a bit scattered but I think I have to get this out. 

I moved away from my best friends because of a bunch of triggers I didn’t process and talk about. I miss them every single day and I don’t feel like I was a good friend to them. We’re still friends and they still love me and I love them, but I made a horrible mistake by moving away. What makes me so upset is the reason why I moved wasn’t real. It was never ever real, it was a defense mechanism. 

So I’m in Art school right now studying animation. Back in highschool I ended up with a lot of trauma within friendships and that only grew in my second year of school. I moved in with my friends and i remember being tired and depressed the minute we moved in. I remember one day waking up and feeling like “oh no, ITS happening again.” I didn’t know what IT was I just remember naming that horrible horrible feeling. I would get triggered all the time in that apartment and I constantly self isolated because in highschool, avoiding the hurt is what got me through. Moving into our second apartment together I took that guilt with me, I also took the aftermath of that experience in that apartment with me. We all should’ve had a big talk about it, we never did.
I soon realized after my partner asked me out that I just, didn’t feel any emotions anymore? And I was terrified because I am such a sensitive person then cycle began. I started getting triggered again, then more stressful events happened, a misunderstanding with my roommates, a confrontation with my roommates as one was upset with myself and my two other roommates, this confrontation occurred while I had just found out my partner had to get emergency surgery on their neck, while also being right in the middle of a relationship conflict with my partner, barely finishing my junior film, being in and out of the hospital and out of fear and anger I decided I’d move out after the lease was over. I didnt feel the care that I usually did, I was just angry and felt trapped. I was paranoid that they were talking about me, angry about dumb things and being petrified of any sort of conversation about feelings. It was only towards the end when I realized I didn’t want this that I let my guard down and actually started getting close with all my roommates again. I regret leaving and I’m grieving the loss of that life I had.

I moved and now I know what it’s actually like to live in a bad situation. And now I want to move again but because the situation is actually bad but I question myself all the time. I moved in with people I don’t know well in a location two hours away from my school and job. I actually try and communicate my feelings but it’s like talking to a forcefield constantly deflecting. I accidentally attracted mice and removed all of my belongings from the room to just try and dissuade them since it’s been singled out that they are apparently only coming from my room. I’m so ashamed of that, I’m in constant fear that because I did this, something horrible is going to happen. Stepping into that apartment makes me feel like I’m going to throw up. The minute I was talked to in a way that made me uncomfortable and addressing it went as well as you’d think, I’ve gone into a chronic stress and anxiety state once more. I want to leave so bad as soon as the mice situation is cleared up. I’ve found myself constantly masking and in survival mode with my roommates pissed about the mice and that I’m never home despite trying to bring across that I work and go to school two hours away and only have two-four hours in the day to do my homework especially during finals season when I was living at school to finish my projects. I realize it’s unfair that they have to deal with the mice without me but I also feel like I physically do not have any more hours hours by the end of my days to commute back for 11pm. 

I have to mourn the fact that I left my best friends, missed out on a school trip because I was paranoid and moving, and made a rash decision because I was in a chronic state of fight or flight and felt like I needed to prove I could “change my fate” I live now in a constant state of fear I felt two years ago in that second year of college. When things actually went down. I have a friend who lives ten minutes from my school and I want to move. I realized I don’t want to “start over” or be alone and isolated far away from everyone. I want to be with my community and my friends. I was so deep in my past trauma that I couldn’t trust that I deserved to be in my community. I didn’t believe my roommates would forgive me for being so unstable in second year. I thought they were against me. Knowing what that actually feels like has taught me that I reacted on a feeling. 

Realizing that I moved on my triggers is a horrible thing to come to terms with. I’m still in school and working (with a not very good insurance) so therapy isn’t really in the cards right now. I think I just feel frozen. I know longer know what decision is the right one to take. The mouse situation feels so huge in my head despite living in a city. Apparently my unit is the only one with mice and additionally apparently the only entry points are in my room. This topped with just finishing the semester and being behind in my thesis film, and being between jobs. I ended up having a huge huge panic attack and feel absolutely 100% terrified of being in my apartment. My parents took me home for a few days to figure out what to do.

I’m sad because I worked very very hard to break myself out of this constant dissociation and derealization this past year only to feel violently thrown back in. I kind of constantly feel like an inconsiderate and bad friend, a bad roommate. At my old place I never acted upon the triggers abut I also never said anything at all, I stopped talking to absolutely everyone even my best friend from back home. I shut off and left. This time I feel like I’m slowly turning back on and realizing my new situation is significantly worse and that I just miss everyone so much.

It’s a good sign that I feel isolated and alone and i don’t see it as a good thing anymore.

 I just wanted to speak the feelings I have on realizing I have been responding to not only past traumas but emotional trauma I’ve suffered as recently as two years ago. I don’t know where to go from here, things may not be as bad as they feel but I can’t really tell."

Communication Problems in Relationship,"First post here, I just found this subreddit and it already seems like a kind and safe place to be. I wonder if anyone else has dealt with similar issues and I just wanted to get a different perspective and or advice.

I've been struggling more and more with functional communication with my partner. I can't really say when it started but its been probably close to a year now. I thought that maybe I just needed to learn to simply communicate better or that it's just, I don't even know something that's just an easy like being mindful.

My partner tells me I've been overly defensive whenever we talk. That I've been coming off cold sometimes. He is taking this as I don't care about his feelings or I always think that he's coming to attack me with my words.

I'm don't even think I've entertained the idea of it being about my mental health and struggles with CPTSD. I've had a horrible childhood as I'm sure all of us here have. So it makes sense that I'm quick on the defense over anything at all.... but I have NO idea how to not be. It's like an automatic response to any slightly POTENTIAL conflict that I've imagined in my mind.

I also feel like if I bring up to my partner that I realize it's from my trauma it is simply going to come off as an excuse for my behavior. Like I'm saying I can be that way because my childhood was traumatic and I don't think that at all. But I don't know how to convey that I think nothing has gotten better in the past year with our communication because I've been ignoring the fact of WHY I am acting like that. It's not a personality trait, it's a defense mechanism from years of abuse.

&#x200B;

Have any of y'all had issues with your partner not understanding or not accepting that your past affects how you are today? Do you have any advice on how to not be so combative?"

I'm someone who has been working with a trauma informed therapist and practicing EMDR and IFS. We never really dealt with my sexual assault at length but recently, something happened which triggered my memories of sexual assault that i experienced while growing up. 

We started doing EMDR and it got very heavy very quickly. My therapist was surprised because I was disassociating a lot. After three years of working with them and processing a lot of trauma, this was a little strange. They think that something more severe happened. More than I can remember. But I can't really recall more than some inappropriate touching. It's quite intense and I'm disassociating and anxious.

(NSFW),"I'll try and keep this brief I (23m) and my sister (19f) lost our dad recently. It was the 27th of December last year. (The same day his father died when he was younger)

For backstory, my dad had alcoholism and end stage cirrhosis of the liver. Towards the end he was sick all of the time, irrational due to endocarditis and an overall miserable person sometimes who made me feel like I was walking on eggshells around him. 

He was always like this aswell, when I was a child I was always being careful and critical of myself in his presence. I'm not sure how much this affected me over my life but I do believe this may have been a form of emotional abuse that feels like  left marks on me and the way I have gone through life. His way of handling things was always ""tough love"" and not communicating. ""Plying it forward"" so to speak. It was very hard to ever open up about personal issues without fear of lack of empathy or understanding.

It really hurts me because I did have love for him, and he did actually care it seemed in his own way, it was just very hard to see and understand sometimes. He had very questionable behaviour, he would say racist and out of pocket, and would flip out and get mad at me over very seemingly small things, such as leaving a bowl out and forgetting to put it into the dishwasher.

It felt like very often if I made a mistake or messed up I was always in fear of his reaction. I learned to tough it out and deal with it over time, and just sort of went with it. But it never fully felt right or resolved. Any criticism he had used to lead to an argument, but I learned to just not engage in the end. He was Italian, who I believe was taught similarly throughout his life from friends and family with a tough love mentality that he warped into his own agenda on parenting which was very different to my mother's (they split when I was 10 due to their differences) my mum left him and he was very depressed for a while. 

We are also both drug takers although I only smoke weed and take kratom, he only drank alcohol although he was taking Suboxone that I had from going through opioid addiction towards the end of his life that I recommend to him because it was safer for his liver which I think may have altered his desicions.

Anyway, last week he killed himself. Infront of me, with a can of mortein fly spray. He was already dying and very sick, but I have a hunch the mortein is what did it. 

On the 27th last month, I was walking up the stairs to get some food while he was laying on the couch as he does... Moments passed and I'm searching through the fridge until I hear the sound of a can spraying, I look over and see my dad inhaling mortein and scream. I ask him if he's trying to fuck with my head and why he did it ( he said he was thirsty ) 

I then wait for 5 minutes, he seemed okay. I looked up all the symptoms of what inhaling mortein can do, none explained that death can occur. So I explained to him that these where the symptoms and this is what he's in for and to have fun with that because I was sick to death of the abuse. I stole the mortein from him and went back downstairs. The next morning I awoke to finding him dead on the couch.

I screamed for my auntie in the neighbour house and we rushed to get the police and ambulance out. I explained everything, his autopsy results outline indications of only death being related to his liver condition.

It is very painful for me as I can't understand why he did that Infront of me, and how he died from it. I feel guilty sometimes, I also feel angry aswell. And also feel like he was trying to send me a message as a final way of him displaying his tough love agenda. My emotions have been terrible and unpredictable.

I keep looking for answers to why he would do that Infront of me.

The only things I can think of is that it was because I use drugs and he was an alcoholic who ""couldn't use drugs"" as he would say in the end. And that was his way of showing me that drugs are bad or something... 

I'm sorry I'm just looking for some help. I am deeply distraught, I just can't get it out of my head. I feel like what he did Infront of me was so hard to understand. I can accept he was out of his mind it still happened and he had something to say otherwise why did he wait to do it Infront of me... I've not always been in the greatest place and we have both struggled with addiction. I am constantly feeling torn between feelings of hatred and trying to understand him.

There was a lot of factors into our relationship, he was very successful before he got sick, and I think that fueled his ego which made him always right. And over the years I turned into a bit of a hermit as I'm mildly social anxious, I believe that might have contributed to his disappointment or dissatisfaction with me as his son. So I think he was blaming me and the drugs but I don't know.

Can anyway help me? How should I deal with these feelings? I have been trying to drown it and it doesn't really work, I'm choosing to be sober the last week but it's it's awfully challenging. please someone help me understand why my tough loving Italian narcissistic dad killed himself infront of me. He did have love but he showed it in this ""tough way"" it's only making me feel worse about myself. I need therapy but for the moment I am hoping anyone could chime in. Thanks for taking the time to read."
CPTSD,physical pain/injuries/scars from traumatic events,18y5345,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y5345/physical_paininjuriesscars_from_traumatic_events/,https://www.reddit.com/user/twinfantasydogs,twinfantasydogs,2024-01-04 05:14:22,physical pain/injuries/scars from traumatic events,"tw: rape, childhood sa & torture, brief self-harm mention

Long story short, i have a hip injury from being raped at 17 that went untreated for over a year. I already have a genetic connective tissue disorder that causes severe joint and muscle pain, so this injury is made worse by this pre-existing condition. But there are days where the pain is so intense, I can barely walk or move. And with every wave of pain, I’m reminded of that day. I’m transported back to the moment the injury happened. I’m reliving those memories while dealing with severe pain. 

I also have scar tissue (some leading to somewhat severe deformities) in some…unsavory places from the sexual abuse I was subjected to as a child. I have scars on my upper arms and back from the physical torture the same man inflicted on me. 

In a similar vein, I have really bad body memories. Like I mentioned with the hip injury, I have flashbacks where I can physically feel when the injury occurred. I can feel the physical sensation and pain I felt when these events were happening. While these things didn’t leave scars, I can still feel things like the electroshock or the feeling of being restrained.

I’m tired of living like this. I’m tired of this trauma overtaking my life. I hate that I have to relive these nightmares over and over and over again. It was one thing to go through it once, it’s another to go through it emotionally every single day after that. I am so tired of the physical and emotional pain I feel. 

I’m tired of the now-physical reminders of the trauma I’ve endured. On top of this, I have a lot of very noticeable scars from past self-harm. I guess I just feel a lot of embarrassment. I feel like my body has been marked by this trauma and this pain, literally. I will never be able to escape bc I can’t escape my body. I’m just tired of not having any control over anything, not even my body. I’m tired of these men still having control over my body."

One of the girls invited him to her engagement party recently and when asked about why she invited him said that he’s more of an acquaintance and did it out of politeness. 

I’m so confused as, I personally would feel a stronger sense of like just not being a dick essentially, to my long term friend and known victim, not… an acquaintance?

This kind of thing happens all the time and both myself and another close friend have asked members of the group about why they keep inviting both of us to these things? 

Note: I have even said I don’t mind the friendship but don’t involve me and him ever. I feel like I would have been ok with them inviting just him and not me even.

Sorry. TLDR: ya bitch is sad because my friends seemingly value a rapists’ feelings over mine #slay"

Weary to the point that it becomes brain fog.  It's been a long day, and I want nothing but sleep.  But I can't.  The fear won't let me.  I have literally no certainty about my future at all, nobody who can support me, so even the standard techniques of self-reassurance don't work - I can't comfort myself through self-parenting because I don't have the resources to be a parent, not even to myself.  Even my partner's comforting touch does nothing tonight (*occasionally* it's exactly what I need, and helps the tears come, but no dice on nights like this), and she also has no job at the moment and is struggling to find one.  I can't make the anxiety stop, because anxiety is objectively appropriate, but I can't function well enough to even stand a chance of combating the sources of that anxiety as long as it's making me miss hours and hours and hours of sleep every damned night.  

EDIT: Sorry that this post doesn't have a whole lot of direction to it, I'm not really asking for replies, I just had a pressing need to *express* this.  And writing it is about all I've got the brainpower to do when I'm this incredibly tired, to try to cope with the unbearable boredom of waiting to also be sleepy.  I swear, ""may you be forever tired but never sleepy"" would be amongst the most evil curses imaginable."

This is technically a friend of a friend who just moved to my town. I helped out with the move and was really excited to have someone I get along with live near me (I have no local friends). At first it was great because we have a lot of common interests and it was really nice to have someone new to hang out with and talk to. But then he and his girlfriend broke up (mostly because he was in a downward spiral with his trauma and being verbally abusive to her and she couldn't take it anymore) and now I feel like I'm his only support system and I'm exhausted. I've spelled out everything that helped me, talked to him in the middle of the night, brought him easy to eat food, and nothing seems to even make a dent in being helpful. I'm so overwhelmed because my own family has given me a lot of new things to process in the last couple of weeks (one so bad I think you guys are the only ones who wouldn't be surprised someone would do it to their own kid) so I'm already struggling to manage myself and keep myself in a healthy state. At the same time, I'm the only one in his life who knows what it's like inside his head, so I do feel some responsibility to support him. I hate seeing him so nonfunctional, but I'm also torn because it's been a week and he hasn't done a single thing that could be remotely counted as being helpful/productive/healing (things like eat a meal or sleep more than an hour or two). Does anyone have any suggestions on how to manage this or other things that might be helpful for him?"

Today I screamed at my abusive ex for a good hour about all the things he's done to me - from the 14 years of cheating to rape. For almost 2 years I've been holding onto him scared to lose him. He and my daughter are my only family. My entire family abandoned me and my daughter after we won a lifetime restraining order against my mom. I love him so much but I'm exhausted. I'm tired of begging him to stop hurting me. I've demanded him to explain to me why he's done this to me so many times... And in the end that doesn't matter. Even if I knew the truth it doesn't help. I've never hurt so much in my life... But for the first time after screaming at him, I felt this exhaustion and defeat. I can't do this anymore. I don't care that he texted me tonight. I've never left him on read in our entire relationship until today. I'm just exhausted and I want to forget him. 14 years. We were so compatible and in love, but when I found out about all the lies almost 2 years ago everything fell apart. I think I'm finally done trying to save the relationship, him or even just talking to him. 

I really hope this continues because I want it to be over."

I don’t have a very loving family, either. They have always been the “suck it up” type. My dad, mom, and grandparents don’t know anything about me. Narcissists run rampant in my family.  I don’t have siblings. My dad (who I live with) doesn’t even know I’ve been in a relationship for 5 years because he’d have my head if he knew I was dating outside of my race. I have always had to keep my entire life quiet, and I am very good at being sneaky and secretive because of it. My friends, as we grow older, are growing more and more unavailable. I feel really alone and just wish I had that family I could go to. Just one family member who would rub my back while I cry and listen to me about my issues and give me advice and love me unconditionally. I remember going back as far as a child pretending to soothe myself to sleep or clean and fix my cuts the way a mother would. I don’t care how old you are, everyone needs a mother or a loving family member even if it is once in a while.

Anyways, this perpetual loneliness seems to have bled into my love life and I hate it. I have tried repeatedly to break up with this man over the course of our relationship, but then I’m completely alone and I feel guilty because the man is literally perfect in every which way and I convince myself I’m self destructing by breaking up with him. He is the only man who has ever treated me decent. 

Yes, I have hobbies and yes I have a full time job and friends and yes I see a psychiatrist and I have tried therapy, but I still feel so alone that I get sick. I haven’t been single since high school and I’m 23 now. I always had back ups, always had someone there. I don’t want to be single and I don’t want to be alone. I want someone there to listen to me cry and to hang out with and to comfort me. If you took a relationship out of the equation, I have no one. Friends only go so far. I don’t want to self soothe anymore and I am so tired. I am scared to be alone because I’m scared I’ll fall back into how I was at 18/19 when I let guys use me thinking that would make them want to love me (hopefully I know better but the CPTSD brain works in awful ways). When I break up with him, I can’t breathe and it’s not even really him, it’s that sick loneliness. And that fear that I will be alone forever or won’t be able to find anyone remotely better.

But no, I can't have that. No no no, I can't be doing good. The mother fucker just HAD to come to my house COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE. He came here at the beginning of November and I am still fucked up because of it. He knows that I am mentally ill and that I struggle a lot with severe anxiety that is closely tied to my ptsd.

I have to remind myself to breathe because I'm holding my breath without realizing it. I can't go outside and when I do I feel like I'm on the verge of passing out or I cry uncomfortably. I hate how entangled he is in my childhood trauma, there's many memories I have from childhood that reminds me of him. I can't even have my own trauma without him trying to be in it. I guess he wins because it's what happened. He won the battle but won't win the war. I won't let him keep me like this, I will throw his ass in the trash where he belongs."

CPTSD,What did you learn in 2023?,18y130c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y130c/what_did_you_learn_in_2023/,https://www.reddit.com/user/eyes_on_the_sky,eyes_on_the_sky,2024-01-04 01:57:49,What did you learn in 2023?,"I kept a journal all throughout 2023--it was probably the first year that I regularly & consistently journaled. I did it almost every day from Jan - Aug, then did it a little less by the end of the year. Each month I would highlight ""insights"" and ""action items"" from my entries, and this week I went back through them all to look for overall themes. 



I started the year pretty lost, feeling empty, feeling like something needed to shift but I didn't know what. Mid-year I began learning more about CPTSD, and began applying it to my own experiences for the first time. Then came a period of immense grief where I looked at my relationship with my parents honestly and realized they would never support me as my true, unique self. I realized that once I am able to move out, I will probably need to go either very low contact, or no contact at all, in order to move forward with my life. Once I was through that grief, I was able to reflect on my growth. Currently I'm sort of ""waiting"" for an opportunity to make progress in my life, because I still need to get financially stable before the moving out and cutting them off can happen. But things feel good now, like I am at the beginning of a new cycle, a new chance. 



4 major themes also emerged of things I often thought about in 2023, which I plan to integrate into my healing work for 2024:  
* **Freedom:** I often wrote about things that make me feel free, such as ""spending time on creative activities,"" ""being physically fit,"" ""visiting new places,"" etc. For 2024 I plan to use some of these as my goals, ultimately chasing the feeling of ""freedom"" as my ideal. 

* **Imprisonment:** Conversely, I often wrote about feeling trapped / stuck. Things that made me feel trapped included, ""living under capitalism,"" ""being a woman in a misogynistic society,"" and ""repeating cycles."" I've decided these are things I need greater detachment from. Many were things that I probably cannot change (like capitalism...) so I will need to figure out how to move forward anyways. 

* **Life:** I wrote sometimes about things that made me feel alive, like ""feeling sunshine,"" ""tasting chocolate,"" ""listening to music,"" etc. I decided these are activities I should turn to for self-care when I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

* **Death:** I also wrote about things that ""felt like death,"" aka thoughts / behaviors that felt hopeless when I encountered them. For example ""the fear that I am unable to heal,"" ""feeling like I need to hide my true self,"" or ""taking on a role of maintaining the peace."" Interestingly for this one I also sometimes wrote about death as a chance for destruction and rebirth, a chance to transform the self. I have decided this is my shadow work category. I want to dig to the root of my fears, and transform my understanding of them to figure out how I can grow and transform anyways. I believe some of these issues are still at the core of why it has been so hard for me to just move forward and live life the way I want to, and I know I'm closer to solving that, but I'm not there quite yet. 




Anyways, I would love to hear about any insights you all had over the past year when it comes to your healing work. How far have you come? What are your goals for 2024?"
CPTSD,I’m happy?,18y0zn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y0zn2/im_happy/,https://www.reddit.com/user/EndlessCheer,EndlessCheer,2024-01-04 01:53:31,I’m happy?,"It’s weird saying it, but I think for the first time in a while, I’m actually doing okay. 

For context, I spent the last three years processing a lot of my trauma. While it was super painful, heart-wrenching, and lonely, I think I finally got to a point where I feel okay. Happy even. It’s a weird feeling to have since it’s been so long since I felt genuinely excited. But it’s a good one. 

I’m proud of myself for doing the emotional work to get me to where I am. Life isn’t perfect, but I feel happy with where I am in life and am looking forward to seeing what comes next. 

I guess, if you’ve gotten this far, I hope you’re in a good place. And if you’re not, please remember that there’s hope for a better tomorrow. 💛✌🏼"

CPTSD,I ended my longest friendship today,18y06ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18y06ja/i_ended_my_longest_friendship_today/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Both_Canary1508,Both_Canary1508,2024-01-04 01:17:17,I ended my longest friendship today,"Ive been working through alot of things in therapy since i regressed in my ocd after being around child abuse in a remote work camp and having all my coworkers normalize it a year and a half ago. Since then ive been struggling with ‘real event’ ocd partly triggered because of my cptsd, thats been making me verbally tic. 

After i aged out of foster care ive been put in situation after situation that went against my beliefs and morals, and since fighting to prove emotional abuse to secure my place in foster care, ive had alot of difficulties continuing to fight for myself or others when i get any pushback. I just remember how exhausting it is and how difficult it is to speak the truth when someones scoffing at you and calling you a liar in the corner, or just how even speaking the truth can hurt someone you care about or love deeply. I dont like to hurt people.  When someone gets mad when i stand up and say something, (like call the police in a dangerous situation or inform the parents of a child that my boyfriends mother endangered without their knowledge) i just crumble and fold. I question everything, even when i know im right. 

Ive isolated myself alot because it feels like no matter where i turn ill just be forced into another situation where im hated if i do anything, and i hate myself if i dont. Somedays it feels like theres no winning and too much pain. Its easier to isolate, even though i know how unhealthy that is and how much its literally tearing me up inside. (Hence the reoccurrence of my ocd; real event intrusive thoughts and verbal tics each time i have them.) 

My friend had a child two years ago. Before she was pregnant with her first, sadly she miscarried. Before she miscarried her first child she was using drugs regularly and in a volatile relationship (evicted for fighting) with a drug dealer who in her own words ‘couldnt work a normal job’. 

Ive always been extremely adamant that children and drug dealers dont mix. Thats not something she was unaware of. My father was a violent drug dealer who committed way worse crimes than just dealing because of the lifestyle. Ones I probably cant mention on here.  I have alot of trauma related to that. He died before i was a teen. But the first time i drank whisky i was 4 and 5 was the first time i smoked pot. Got my first gun under the tree at 4 too. Ive gone through alot of things, including having to get over my own idolization of drug dealers and that lifestyle which for a short period led me down a bad path. But never once has my opinion about drug dealers and kids changed. Ive always believed youre guaranteeing some sort of trauma if you have a child and you deal drugs. And i didnt want any part of it. By the time i was 20 i had seen foster sisters get addicted and prostituted, id seen two friends die and my boyfriend almost die in bed beside me. Homelessness and drug addiction was becoming more and more visible in my community, and so i stopped. I dropped all my friends, i helped my boyfriend quit, and ive continued to watch my community and people with similar backgrounds as me struggle and die. It sucks and i dont want to be around the people who contribute to that, or excuse it. You dont kick someone whos already down. In the current state of things theres no moral ground you can stand on if youre dealing drugs laced with fent. 

When she told me she was keeping the baby (she had previously stated several times she was wanting an abortion and that she was hoping she could party and miscarry if you get what im saying) i realized i couldn’t be a part of her life at that time. I told her that as nicely as possible, said i still loved and care about her. She was upset and blocked me. Not a big surprise, i understood. Over a year later she messaged me asking if we could rekindle the relationship and that her situation had changed. Ie no drugs, boyfriend had a real job and wasnt a drug dealer and she was pregnant again. I obviously agreed because i still did want to be friends. 

But she lied and i didnt find out until a year later, after she had named me his godmother. I felt stuck. And betrayed. I didnt say anything for another two years. While working through therapy after ive regressed ive realized i need to stop enabling that behaviour and being worried about other peoples reactions because it was seriously impacting my mental health. Everytime shed talk about the money they excessively spent, the 6k on takeout every month because it would cost more for him to cook then be out drug dealing and buy takeout, her new braces, their upcoming trip to italy and scotland. I couldnt do it. Everytime i was just so angry inside.  I dont want to fucking hear about all the blood money youre spending made off the back from the most disadvantaged people in our community, while having a child.  I dont want to hear about his sketchy partners and his bullshit that endangers their child. And I definitely dont want to fucking hear about how the nurse that checks in on them every two months says ‘theyre great parents’. I just dont. Because they arent and they arent ‘good’ people and it really fucking bothers me that she could go through her own struggle with her parents (who were abusive, just not with drugs) and still think thats okay. Not to mention reinvolve me in that situation when she knew it went against my morals and was connected to past trauma.  

And thats the entire reason i didnt want to be around her before. I cant not be angry. it just fucking sucks my childhood best friend has chosen a life that goes against my own long held morals and beliefs that are based off of personal experience. Like what are the god damn chances. I just wish life was easier sometimes.

Today I told her we should take a step back. Nicely. Said i was hurt and i still loved her, i didnt say how angry i was or say anything i really wanted to because it would have hurt her and thats not what i want. She can live her life, and i hope she has a great life. I just dont want to be around it or hear about it because it pains me deeply. And i cant keep that all bottled up and let the resentment spill out other ways, everyone deserves supportive friends, and i cant be that for her. She has other people in her life that dont have personal trauma and beliefs that collide with her lifestyle. And its not healthy for me to be around people who normalize the type of trauma and abuse i went through for so many years. 

I just needed to vent. Im really sad. But i have to start living my life in a way where i can be happy with myself, and my decisions. And i need to remember that doing the right thing often makes you sad, or isnt easy, people can be mad or hate you, but its easier than letting it slide and pushing it down in the long run. Ive unfortunately been learning that lesson for over a year now. If you got to the end, thanks for listening ❤️"
CPTSD,"Do you repeatedly forget that you're ""ill""?",18xzuey,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xzuey/do_you_repeatedly_forget_that_youre_ill/,https://www.reddit.com/user/NadalaMOTE,NadalaMOTE,2024-01-04 01:02:21,"Do you repeatedly forget that you're ""ill""?","Today I had a medication review with a new psychiatrist, so he wanted to do a full history. It took two hours, and I am completely fried. But what really struck me was, he was the first clinician to go through my ENTIRE medication history, and he said:

""From what I can see in your file, you've been receiving medical support for your mental health for over 10 years. That's a really long time to be unwell.""

And it was with no judgement, it was just the facts as they are. In fact it was said with the most compassion I've ever heard. It has been a really long time that I have been unwell. 

And even though I'm medicated and going through the therapy system, I still never remember the fact that I'm unwell when I'm judging my decisions and behaviour. I'm so critical of myself for getting things wrong and making mistakes, and never think ""it's okay, you're actually pretty unwell"" even though that is a perfectly accurate statement."
CPTSD,Stress tolerance appointments and events,18xz6q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xz6q7/stress_tolerance_appointments_and_events/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Capleau,Capleau,2024-01-04 00:34:10,Stress tolerance appointments and events,"I cannot handle any changes or surprises in my day to day life without having a severe panic attack or flashbacks of varying degrees and types from fight/flight volatile instinctive reactions, to dissociating and losing track of time, space and my body, to being frozen mentally and physically but still aware what’s happening (I am medicated, do EMDR therapy, and have a psychiatrist for 3 years). 

What’s worse is when I have an upcoming appointment, what’s even worse is when things lined up and I have 3 appointments in one week, and another the next week, unexpected car troubles. 

I feel completely dysregulated due to this and at this point know how to identify that i have a certain capacity with how much i can take on or experience in one week based on my history, patterns, triggers I’m aware of, and discussing with therapist and psychiatrist these problems. 

I wanted to see if anyone experiences this lack of stress tolerance when there are too many stressful appointments and social meetings in one week: does it also induce heightened flashbacks/ fight/flight or panic attacks?  

I had a bad flashback last night and my neck back and body feels like it got ran over. I had a family member who was making plans and asking us what would work- when I said this weekend will probably not work for me because I have too many appointments and will not be able to handle back to back stress aka flashbacks and panic attacks, so this weekend won’t work for me at least. I got the response of ""there are 10 other peoole too"" too bad, essentially in the most rude tone as if i am
just being selfish for responding to the question.

This was triggering me immensely fight/flight and texted my family member i am
sick of my problems being framed this way, i
talk to my therapist about these problems and am told it is the right thing also to be realistic with my capacity and honor my bodys needs to be grounded. i was trying to be realistic with my capacity and not just some selfish choice. i feel like family picks and chooses when to take
into account my stress window and disorders/ mental illnesses despite they witness my inability to adapt or partake in several areas of life, 
i also have ocd germophobia and agoraphobia i have worked on to even get to be able to go to in person appointments or any social gatherings.

I also wanted to see if your family frames your capacity of how much you can take on in one week as selfishness, or if they understand you have lower stress tolerance window and are being preventive so you do not have intense and painful mental/physical flashbacks? 

It is hurtful mean and triggering when it’s framed in this way when you are trying to be self aware and responsible with your capacity and known patterns. But some tend to twist the intent when they are not happy you have a stress disorder and pretend that context doesnt matter."

When you're raised in environments that are strictly uncaring, abusive and neglectful, your only knowledge of your surroundings is that it is normal. 

I realize however that none of the people I grew up with, blood parents or otherwise, were ever actually present for me. I was always alone. I have no photographs with any of them, from childhood or adolescence. They never took photos with me, they never took photos of me! My only childhood photos are school and yearbook photos! And I remember my 'father' at age 6 saying I looked ugly in my new glasses. The only photos that existed of me then were hated. Between the multiple men who took place as my father, I received two hugs between them in all my life. Only one from the women who took place as mother. (I remember feeling physically sick whenever I saw someone getting a hug. I would never know that.)

More recently I found myself in a situation where I was subordinate to a team lead in an abroad work-related team building exercise, and got sick for an entire week. The team lead asked me every day that I was sick how I was feeling, if I was okay - he seemd genuinely concerned. I realized this was more concern coming from a complete stranger than I'd ever received when I was sick growing up. Every time I got the question I'd cry to myself after. When I got sick as a child I was left in my room with a pale. No one ever held me, took care of me, 'rubbed my back' as I hear so many examples of... left alone in my room while sick with the TV on... TV was always on. If I ever got sick by accident outside the bathroom or pale I got in trouble for it... a few times my ""mother"" made me ""clean up \[my\] mess!"" myself.

In fact, once - when I was 16, I stepped on a rusty nail sticking out of one of the floor boards in the house I was then living at. I was instantly bleeding all over the floor and I cried out for help (it went quite deep), and when my ""father"" saw what happened, he started screaming at me. How stupid could i be to not ""watch where the fuck I \[was\] going?!"" Because it was rusty they thought they had to take my to the hospital (the myth being rusty nails are the culprit of tetanus), interrupting his plans to sit on his ass on the couch eating bag after bag of potato chips, drinking shitty beer and watching that fucking idiot show 'King of the Hill'. But I ruined his Saturday night. I've never forgotten this episode. 

When I hear about fathers who love their daughters, take them to do fun things like museums and carnivals, hug them, cuddle then, kiss them, hold their hand, I cry instantly. I fall apart. Tears are welling in my eyes right now just thinking about it. I'll never have a father. Who could I have been had I had a loving father instead? Recently I was at a museum and I saw a father showing his young daughter a display in their gallery of Ancient Greece. And of course the young girl was on her phone the whole time, uninterested in the tour her father was giving her. I saw and watched the scene play out and it killed me inside. I had to leave because I couldn't stop the tears. I just wanted to tell her how lucky she is to have a father interested and invested in her enough to give her the gift she was just throwing away! I'd give my life to have one day with a father who could do this for me. 

But I will never have a father. The pain of this realization physically hurts me. "
CPTSD,Unhealthy doesn't always equal abuse ❤️,18xysgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xysgw/unhealthy_doesnt_always_equal_abuse/,https://www.reddit.com/user/ElishaAlison,ElishaAlison,2024-01-04 00:17:03,Unhealthy doesn't always equal abuse ❤️,"I've been trying to figure out a way to say this, that makes sense. 

I think, we tend to think of unhealthy, or toxic, behavior, as always equating to abusive. And that can make us afraid or unwilling to look at our own behavior critically. I know I was terrified at the prospect of figuring out that my own behavior might be toxic, because I felt that would make me ""just like my abusers.""

But, there's a whole spectrum of unhealthy behavior, that doesn't involve abusing people (although there's a lot of nuance here, and some of what I'm about to list could lead to abusive behaviors)

- not knowing how to set boundaries

- not knowing when to put yourself first

- not feeling comfortable voicing your needs

- being afraid to communicate

The first, and most important, thing I'd like to say is, engaging in unhealthy behavior DOES NOT MAKE YOU LIKE YOUR ABUSERS. 

It's *normal* after trauma to experience these things. These things are not intrinsic aspects of your personality that you cannot change. These things can be helped so much through processing your trauma.

I think for me, a big portion of why I had so much trouble with healthy communication was the toxic shame that was foisted on me by my abusers. It made me distrustful and afraid of people. Once I fully internalized that I am and always have been a person who's worthy of care and respect, communication became so much easier. 

I wanted to share this because I know so many of us struggle with these things. And I hope so much that you, dear reader, will find healing. Because you deserve it. You always have ❤️"

but to elaborate, sry so long! the situation i was in that led to me getting diagnosed with (c)ptsd (i feel like i liar if i say cptsd instead of ptsd because my chart only lists it as ptsd for the dsm code i believe?) but that situation lasted 6 years of my life and was constant so there’s a lot there, if that makes sense. but i was in PHP/IOP from may-halloween and got transferred from the first one to a specialized ptsd specific program after they diagnosed me with ptsd at the first place. 

my symptoms at that point were genuinely physically debilitating as well as mentally torturous,  so, i took a hiatus from law school to do the ptsd program. overall, treatment helped me a lot.

but my question is whether it’s ok/normal to keep processing difficult specific abuse memories/managing flashbacks that may have been triggered that u hadn’t thought about ever since it happened/thought about in years. thankfully doing much better today than the past few days but just worried if this is normal at this point in the hopefully recovery timeline tysm to anyone. i can’t tell if this is me being unrealistic in what healing is, tho, so feel free to (hopefully kindly) lmk if that’s what u think, too 🤍"

I'm to stuck on this shit.,"We were talking about things we should have sold at the dinner table when my (22m) sister (20f) brought up the pokemon card thing. I hate when I get reminded of the recent pokemon card selling craze because I think about how my parents (53f/54m) forced me to give mine up to my sister when I was 8. She wishes she saved them. I wish I still had them before my parents took them from me and probably lied about my intentions. And maybe I'm getting beat up over trivial shit, but I also wish I had parents that didn't treat us like two halves, one of which is ""okay to hit,"" and lie too on the basis that I've been diagnosed with autism since 5 and have ""black and white irrational thinking."" My sis probably thinks I'm crazy for getting all stern at the dinner table saying, ""They weren't yours! Mom and Dad coerced me into giving them to you,"" before walking off while our parents act dumbfounded. She always comes to bat for them pretty much, even when they lie to me, shove me out the room when I breath too loud in my sleep for her, physically abuse me, and say I'm a burden. If I told her friends any of this stuff maybe she'd lose some of them. Though our parents are too amazing in her eyes to be like this.

Maybe I should just let it all go, given I'm literally 22 and I hope to move out this year. Crazy how I'm such a tragedy that my Mom feels the need to express the irrelevant fact she has an autistic child in an article about her painting exhibition, yet I'm able to move out, finish college, get a job, live independently, and hopefully fucking distance myself from these mind games.

PS: Does anyone else feel like nobody in their family believes them, and wonders if they're just lying about their family so it's easier to feel sorry for themselves? My therapist calls the reason behind this feeling ""gaslighting,"" but why does nobody else get upset at my parents on my behalf?"

This is my first time posting here. I really need words of guidance and reassurance. This month marks 5 months after going no contact with my mom, who is the largest contributer to my CPTSD. I don't really want to go into what she did or why I went no contact, partially because it's a very long story, but also because my therapist has been working with me on not oversharing. What I'm really looking for is support. 

Since I was sixteen I've struggled with seasonal depression, but this year was by far the worst. I spend every year in fear of my mom, dreading seeing her during the holidays, and I thought that being no contact would make that better, but it didn't. I spent the last two and a half months in a constant mix of feeling terrified she would contact me, either to scream at me or to just pretend everything is normal, and grief from not having her. I feel numb having gone through my birthday, my nieces and nephews birthdays, the birth of my youngest nephew, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years without hearing from her. I constantly find myself thinking about the good times from when I was young, and just end up feeling confused. I should hate her. This should be easy, but it's not. I know I need to talk to my therapist about this, and my therapist knows I have been struggling to an extent, but I keep finding myself avoiding the subject. 

This all has been really hard. I felt both distraught and relieved when I finally went no contact, and for each significant event since. I still think of her every day.

i just came home from having to put my dog Earl down. he’s super old and was slowing down in the last six months but i just thought we had more time together. feels like it came out of nowhere. i miss him so fucking much already i feel so empty. i feel like im in shock it all progressed so quickly today.

it was definitely the right decision. on the way to the vet he was so upset and anxious and uncomfortable, panting a lot, and was feeling so bad about peeing in my car bc he couldn’t help it, and i just kept talking to him and rubbing his ears and telling him what a good boy he is. he acts the same at the vet and we deliberate for an hour and a half before deciding to put him to sleep. when he comes back to the exam room after they put in the IV port thing on his paw, he’s stopped panting, he’s completely calm, and he lays down in front of me and just seemed so peaceful and calm. it’s like he knew, and i know that sounds ridiculous but it’s true. he took away any doubt in my mind that this was the right decision, he was just tired and ready to go to sleep.

i kept up a brave face for Earl this whole time but once the vet confirmed his heart had stopped i just felt like a huge piece of me died too. i stayed with his body for an hour and it was the hardest thing to leave him there for the vet to cremate his body.

i feel like my chest is caved in. Earl saved my life, and i feel so fucking guilty i couldn’t do the same and fix him. there was literally nothing else i could have done and i still feel this overwhelming guilt like i let him down and i can’t breathe. 

he was the best boy in the world. the gentlest soul, never hurt a fly, he loved cats and bunnies and other dogs and people  especially little kids bc he loves when someone chases him and kids never run out of energy for that. he was obsessed with every food but especially croissants and peanut butter. he was the loudest snorer he sounded like a grown ass man snoring in his bed every night, and he’d sleep-bark a lot when he was dreaming. 

i miss him."

Hoping you are well.

I wondered if any of you might be able to give me some advice on an unsettling situation. In sum, the woman who groomed me when I was a 12-13 year old has tried to contact me out of the blue -- the last communication was when the abuse was ending, a decade ago.

Can anyone help me understand why this woman would try to contact me after all this time? I find it difficult to comprehend, almost to the point that it beggars belief.

This is me coming back to the top to say.. I am so sorry that this is so long.. wow. I did not mean to make this so long! Also I had no idea what flair to use! .. Thank you if you made it to the end!   

A little background -- Back in 1998 when I was first diagnosed with PTSD I was also diagnosed with BPD and other things. Now I had no idea what BPD was and neither did my husband at that time. Back in those days the internet hadn't been public for very long. I think my husband's mother first got the internet in her house in 1996. We were living with the husbands family at that time as well and had a son who was just a baby (born Aug 1997). I didn't have my first break down until 4 months after he was born. That is another story for another time. I ended up in the psych hospital right around the start of the new year 1998 for the first time due to this breakdown and the situation that caused it.  I was in and out of the hospital several times in the next 8 months then again several more times in the next couple years.  It was summer 1998 that my social worker at the hospital told me about disability for my chronic ptsd, nightmares, and all the other horrible things I was going through at the time and with her help I got sign up and accepted onto SSI.   

That was a big intro there but this post is mostly about the BPD. When I told my husband what they said I had, well ptsd made sense because I was horribly abused all my life growing up and I literally got married to get away from the abuse in the super religious family. (Not recommended!)  But neither of us had even heard about BPD or what it meant. My husband went to the internet to try to look up stuff about it.  But he got dragged down a rabbit hole and eventually fall into a chat group with other men, husbands, to women with BPD.  The next thing I knew I was the villain. These husbands told horror story after horror story about women with BDP. Things their wife's supposedly did to them because of this disorder.    

I would like to think that now that I am in my mid 40's that BPD is not as widely known as the curse DX.  Back then everything you read was how no therapist would work with you, how BPD women (it seemed women were the only ones Dxd with it back in those days) .. are very manipulative.  How they will use your kids against you, they will give the BPD as well if the kids hang around you too much. He started not letting me around my own son (and eventually my daughter as well who was born in April 1999) .. Ever thing out of my mouth was ""my BPD"" .. every I did and said was because of BPD. There was a new book that came out called Walking on Eggshells in 1998 that became the Bible in that men's group.  They would sit around in chats almost all day just talking about their horrible wife's or horrible ex's   

It got to the point where i was the one walking on eggshells. I did my own research in those days and everything I found did make it out to sound like BPD was the devils curse and you can't trust a person with BPD with anything.  My ex started cheating on me saying being with me was too hard for him and he needed to be able to go out with his ""friends"" (who turned out to be a female friend) to get a break from .. well from me.. and my BPD.  I was not just his wife or just me anymore i was ""me plus BDP""  everything  out of his mouth was about it. I truly did not really believe I had it based on the criteria of it at the time. I didn't think most the things fit me. Sure some did because some things fall under PTSD and other things as well.   
  
I only stayed with him for 4 years before getting a divorce and there was a lot more domestic abuse happening above and beyond BPD accusations. It was when he nonchalantly told me that he cheated on me.  I was in therapy at the time .. having to take my toddler and baby with me because he was out so much with ""friends"" and his mother who took his side on most everything worked a lot so they suddenly stopped worrying about ""BPD me"" with my own kids.   

I left him .. after a huge domestic fight with both him AND his mother .. I took the kids with me but they got an emergency order to come to the domestic abuse facility and take them from me claiming ""she was abused all her life and she has BPD we have to get those kids away from her: and the F-ing judge .. agreed. Agreed that a person with abuse history will hurt their own kids .. and women with BPD are dangerous.  This is followed by years of court me trying to get my kids back .. until i stop trying because my poor son was old enough to get effected by this ""back and forth"" thing. Him and his very sudden new wife (the cheater husband/wife duo here) ended up getting custody and iw as the the ""visiting parent"" because I was abused and that stupid male judge took the fathers side so much and I was the villain because ""they were afraid I would beat my kids cus I was abused"" (sorry still bitter about this and it's been years)   

IT was several years later that my new therapist told me that she in no way thinks I have BPD nor had it before and that back in those days .. they handed BPD out like candy -- especially to women. Now I do not want anyone to think that I think BPD is this horrible thing. I never believed I was this horrible person that my husband and his friends were making me out to be. I know I had issues, I know I had/have severe ptsd (cPTSD was unofficially added by my current therapist as my abuse went on most of my life and well into adulthood as well) ..I know i had depression and anxiety and I know i have ""some things that fall under BPD"" I just never believed I was nearly ""as bad"" as these stories my husband would tell me that he got from those other men. I don't know if those stories they told were true or exaggerated either i just know that I didn't think I fit under that umbrella they made up. 
  
I think that BPD and therapy has come a long way since those days -- least I hope so!! I know that some people still think it's horrible and I don't understand why. People get these things because of trauma. I don't think it is fair to blame the person who got BPD because of how they were raised.  I don't think it is fair to make that an entire identity and forget about the abuse and all other things the person went through .. that made them fall under the BPD umbrella -- the real umbrella not the horrible one those men and my husband made .. their umbrella was too much.. too far .. it added more trauma to my already long list.   

I lost my family .. I lost custody of my kids (i got custody back unofficially because I never went through the courts .. I will say again.. Another long story for another time!)  when they were in middle school because husband and new wife (the one he cheated on me with) .. abandoned them at his father's house and after his father took care of them for 6 months and he didn't see his son.. my ex-husband ever.. The grandfather called me to get them saying he already raised his kids and he didn’t want to do it again. Understandable. His wife (the kids grandmother had already passed from an aneurism) and it's not fair to expect your widowed father to raise your kids alone while your off partying etc! (That is what my ex was doing.. They both were off getting high and stealing from people to keep getting high  -- again that is another story for another time)   

.. so I did, I went and got them. I raised them -- they are in their 20's now and i hear compliments about how nice they are and how i did well raising them and neither one of them have BPD ... (my husband used to say that i would give it to them because i guess it can be passed on like the plague \*shrugs\*) .. In the end .. I  do not have BPD nor did i ever have it .. but that is the Dx that ruined my family .. (along with other issues not mentioned but it was one of the big things that contributed)   
I guess the thing i want to say most is that having BPD is not a bad thing. I hope they are further along now days to know that it's not your fault if you have it and it's not the devils curse and you deserve proper treatment.  And if you ever think that you are dx'd wrong about anything.. speak up .. you have a right to say ""i know i might have this and that but i don't have these other 4 criteria so i don't think it fits me.""  And you have a right to second opinions and 3rd and 4th.   

I hope this doesn't come off as anything bad to anyone. It is just me sharing my own personal story and I do not nor would i ever judge anyone who does have BPD. I will say again that I do not think it is the devils curse and i would definitely be friends with anyone .. whether they have it or not.  That was a big thing back when I was in my 20s .. no therapist wanted to work with me .. and once people heard i had BPD -- from the husband .. I lost friends and couldn't make new ones.   

That book ""Stop Walking On Eggshells"" has a byline that says ""Taking Your Life Back When someone you love has borderline personality disorder""  .. just the title alone makes it sound like people with BPD are horrible people .. and the men (or family)  with it need to ""take their life back"".. because we somehow .. ruined it?? I never read the book because it was being used against me for so long and i was afraid to see what it actually said. Maybe it is a good book for people who use it as it was intended but for me its a trigger .. I was the one walking around on eggshells around my husband ... because i couldn't live, breathe or be me.. without adding ""BPD"" after my name, all of my thoughts, all of my actions .. everything i said and did was ""because i had bpd"" .. he said .. and if we argued he said  ""oh that just your bpd saying that"" .. if i  get upset or sad ""you are just manipulating me with your bpd"" .. etc etc I wasn't allowed to feel real human things because its was me somehow manipulating him .. all the time.. every time  

BPD is a real thing, I know it is a real thing. But you are not a horrible person if you have it. It is not your identity. You deserve love, care, compassion, and help just as much as anyone else does for any other mental health issue. 
  
That is all and thank you so much for getting this far .."
CPTSD,Is it possible to recover from prolonged neglect?,18xuvyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xuvyh/is_it_possible_to_recover_from_prolonged_neglect/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Dangerous-Ostrich364,Dangerous-Ostrich364,2024-01-03 21:38:17,Is it possible to recover from prolonged neglect?,"Hi, this is going to be long and I dont know what I'm going to get out of it other than knowing I've vocalised it somewhere.Tldr at the end. I am a hopeless 33 year old male who has never had a relationship and has never had a job higher than minimum wage.

I feel like an utter failure and coming to terms with childhood neglect to heal and recognise the cause of my shortcomings.

My parents were hoarders, substance abusers and gambling addicts but maintained just the right level of social consciousness to pass any of the numerous social services visits.

They would sleep all day 2 or 3 times a week when on a comedown or when they had run out of money for drugs. 

My mother suffered form depression and wouldn't cook or clean or do anything but sleep. We lived in filthy conditions and my dad would blame us (me and my 3 sisters) 
We had a reputation as the family of  ""tramps"" (homeless person in the uk.) 
Adults would smile at me and my sisters and then tell their children to stay away from us to avoid getting head lice. 

From the ages of 11-16 I was perpetually hungry.  Some days I would get so irritable from it that I would cry with rage. I couldn't focus at school and skipped school 30% of the time.


We would wash once a week, and I could count the amount of times I brushed my teeth for the first 15 years of my life on my fingers. I would go to school with dirty unform that smelt of stale cigarettes and adults would hold their noses when near me or say a comment to another adult thinking (as adults often do) that I'm a child and therefore incapable of comprehending what they are saying right in front of me.

I went to 5 different schools by the time I was 16 (2 is the norm in this country.) 
Our family was evicted from our first home when I was 9 because my parents defaulted on their rent. We spent a few nights in hostels and with relatives then we broke into our old flat and my parents told us to lay low. I remember them even saying it's like we're the borrowers. We can live there for a while but we can't be seen.

I was also 9 when I was expected to take my 6 year old sister to school which was 30 minutes walk down a motorway. We were told to tell teachers that we were dropped off just outside the gate. This was just one of many lies we told on behalf or our parents.

The following is not neglect but certainly added a strain on my mental health. I was 14 when I was outed as gay by a friend I confided in. At first my mates pretended they were cool with it but they slowly started distancing themselves from me when they'd tease each other by making kissing faces whenever one of them would talk to me. From 14-16 I had extremely limited contact with anyone. This severe isolation messed with my mental health so badly that I really can't remember much from those years.

TL;DR
 I want to know if it's possible to overcome decades of negative mental health states? What is the best way to process and deal with it? 

I've tried to accept that I will never amount to anything and that I should look to philosophies like Minimalism, Buddhism and Stoicism that emphasise being happy with less or achieving a state of peace in the mind.

Has anybody else gone through anything similar, and could you spare any advice? "

I have interests, but nothing that I necessarily *do*, if that makes sense. I go through certain phases where I engross myself in certain things, and kind of go all out. For example, about 6 or 7 years ago or so, I was really into Game of Thrones and the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series in general. I wanted to know everything I possibly could about that world. A couple years later, I was on a VERY big Beach Boys kick, and delved into that realm. After that, I think my next obsession was Mortal Kombat. Now I'm very into Dragon Ball Z. I've dabbled in a few different languages as well... Spanish, German, and Koine Greek... A little Hebrew...  


I used to play a little guitar, but right now, I don't have the patience to relearn what I've lost. Same with drawing and sculpting. I used to be great, but I've lost my patience for all of it and now I'm nowhere near what I was.  


I'm a Christian and love to research the Historic Christian Faith, but I'm earning a doctorate in ministry, so at this point, it's nothing I do for fun. Aside from that, it's also my job.  


So I realize that I don't really have any hobbies, and there's something about me that doesn't really desire adding anything else to my plate, but on the other hand, I do very little for myself.  


In the summer, I garden... But other than that... I feel boring.   


What do you do that interests you? I'd love to know because I'd like some ideas for myself."

It triggers my thinking of I'm a subhuman being & piece of trash. (I know that's not true logically but my feelings say otherwise)

Most of my ptsd comes from not feeling safe at home & at school when I was younger. Bullied endlessly with no counter weight of love & acceptance. I was potentially sexually assaulted in my late 20s. I say potentially because when I use to talk about it some people have told me no & some yes. Basically, someone I thought I was in love with got on top of me unexpectantly & when I said no a bunch of times. He continued but I finally said yes & than he proceeded. I was soo emotionally unmature so that just seems really wrong. I'm not sure if that plays a part in what goes through my mind in the exam room. I JUST HATE IT."

can anyone relate to this? if you relate to this and ur comfortable what was ur childhood like? does anyone know what this could be/come from? is this something that can be fixed or worked on? has anyone overcome this? is it even something that needs to be worked on? for me it is agonizing, but only because i’m told i *should* want relationships and i get like fomo."

Working out is not the only thing I experience this with but it takes the biggest toll on my health. My self image and self esteem are especially low since I've lost so much muscle and just feel weak and lethargic all the time. I also learned I'm autistic recently if that is useful context.

What can I do? Does anyone else go through this? I'm beyond exhausted of feeling this way."

I recently was diagnosed with cPTSD (30, f). I, myself, think about autism quite often. Took some tests, did some self reflection and healing on my trauma in therapy.
I asked my therapist, if we could test for ASD, but she said: ‚With complex trauma we won‘t be able to figure out if the symptoms result from trauma or ASD.‘

I don‘t feel comfortable with the answer: cause why not test it and then say ‚not able to tell‘ rather than ‚nah, we can‘t and don‘t even try‘.

Also a problem: I have no one to evaluate my childhood, cause no contact with mother due to abuse and no other family rather than younger brother.

Context: living in Germany. And I feel to anxious to ask for diagnostic tests (again)."

Dad molested me as ''joke'' almost 2 years ago and I was gaslighted. My mom sa-ed me year ago and I was also gaslighted and victim blamed about that. They wanted me to go to psychologist for having such thoughts. Sister said ''the fact that you still remember that'' they’re all against me 

I called lawyer and they were mad cause telling lawyer mom kissed me on chest is embarrassing as my family said and lawyer would grape me how dad said because I was talking to lgbt people on Facebook who gave me that number 

This happened in 11 December. Mom threatened with police on theoretical lgbt guys who she called satanists and pedos because I changed name I Facebook (I’m trans boy) I called police and they drove me to police building. I signed warning so she wouldn’t take me to psychologist. 

I was there for hours and my family was mad at me again. Parents and grandpa came, they talked with police and told that guy I was acting like that because i stayed at grandparents for 2 year when there was Covid and didn’t have real life friends 

When they left that man asked if I love parents because they love me. I told him that dad touched my genitalia cause he thought that’s funny and man said ''people are individuals with different personalities'' and he asked ‘’you know how you are looking?'' Of course I would look nervous 

In car dad said that lawyer would pretend to be police and grape me. They blamed lgbt people for trying to ruin family by making me send mom to jail. I wasn’t sending her to jail. I called lawyer for advice cause they’re insane. 

Mom told me older  sister knew about my accounts and saw awful comments. Awful comments were comments by people on post on Reddit about my mom sa-ing me

I got home and my sister started being transphobic and blaming me again. 

''See how you scared you are? Your eyes are black'' she said that trans people I had on Facebook would make me a sex worker. There are trans people who can’t have other job but that doesn’t mean she cares about me. She said Americans called what my mom did covert incest because they watch p*rn and joke about Alabama 

She said she had been seeing for last 10 days how I was stabbing myself in her dreams. ''Have ever thought universe is talking through people? What if me talking is universe taking to you?'' She thinks she spiritual when she is controlling 

She made fun of my names I had online. I had different names because I thought if she found one account she wouldn’t find other account with that name. I realised she had been stalking for long time 

No my mom is more controlling and scared of me texting that people again. She blames heavy music and makes me wear clean nail polish. I have to wait some years so I can be free from them. It’s crazy "

I have these feelings about 1 to 7 times a week, last from 1 to 5 hours.

It starts with some feelings in my body, like increased heart rate, bowel movement, being cold or anything else, then intrusive thoughts start like ""no, it starts again"" ""I can do nothing against it"" ""nobody can help me"" ""I will forever feel miserable"", ""I am a hopeless case"", ""I will never have a good life"", ""only way out is >!suidide!<""
Combined with heavy feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, being isolated, desperate and anxiety. My body of course also reacts, with freeze, shivering/shaking, being tensed up.

And these situations somehow are a self-fulfilling prophecy, as when I keep heaving these breakdowns, I will not be able to have a job or whatever, so as long as they are there, these thoughts are aomehow right, so it is really hard for me, to fight against it.

Anyone else having similar symptoms and / or strategies to handle them?"

Hi everyone, just joined the group today after some memories surfaced quite randomly/after thinking over the last few months. I'm 25F, UK. I live with type one diabetes and have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, just to briefly start.

I was terrified growing up because I didn't ever have money as an emergency if I had to buy food and also have a very restricted medical diet just to complicate matters. My mam received dla on my behalf but I never received any of it directly, she must have used it to house me etc. 

A couple of problems holding me back now, I suspect to stem from some really horrific experiences I had (medical trauma?) Growing up as someone with undiagnosed adhd and autism, being type one diabetic and having coeliac. 

I never dare ask for help when I need it these days which is quite often, even when it's life or death: I had several seizures believed to have been caused by my low blood sugars and not waking up to them/having to walk down stairs to get treatment. One of the times that I was borderline passed out times was in public with my auntie. When I tried to explain what was going on (slurring my words) she snapped at me and told me to wait. I lost the ability to keep standing and also lost my vision (I'd describe it as that migraine fuzzy distorted vision loss). She told me i was dramatic and demanding and that I only had to wait, dragged me up and demanding I started walking again -I couldn't. 

On a school trip, I had one in front of all my class mates during the night. My teacher at the time got me to walk downstairs and I couldn't eat because i felt so sick but my body was shutting down on me and i just remember saying I needed to sleep and kept almost drifting off. He made me try to walk up 5 flights of stairs but i kept falling and crawling and had to stop eventually because again, I couldn't see. We informed the place i was staying i was coeliac but the just took items off rather than substitute so I didn't eat enough carbs. I was too traumatised to advocate for myself however and experienced shutdown due to the autism. The teacher rang my parent first of all, instead of an ambulance, who demanding he didn't ring an ambulance and said she was coming to pick me up (2 hour drive). Meanwhile I was refusing to eat because I felt I was going to be sick. They were furious with me when they arrived for not eating more snacks the night before, like the cereal bars I'd been sent away with.

Similarly in college, I had a lecturer furious with me because I chose to treat a hypo in class discretely, as opposed to walking down 4 flights of about 15 stairs and going to the canteen, despite me bravely explaining despite being traumatised because I was being ridiculed and scolded for eating for medical reasons and the whole class was staring at me/laughing.

* self harm warning* : When my mam and step dad found out about my self harm they were enraged and thought i was ungrateful for everything they did to put a roof over my head and provide for me, and criticised me for doing something so ""silly and upsetting"", threatened to take away my privacy and did and so on. 

I used to be called selfish for needing to hide in my room whenever family was round and I couldn't be surrounded by all the loud voices at once and so many people and not knowing what to say etc. 

I was told I was lazy and careless and just not putting in the work from the diabetic clinic I was with, was constantly met with judgement and criticism and was threatening either hospitalisation/them showing me someone who hadn't looked after their blood sugars well. I was told I had potential I just wasn't meeting by school, was told I would never cope as an adult if I had meltdowns over tiny things, so on. 

So sorry for the detail, but I just wondering if anyone knows of a specific UK therapist/who to get in touch with to try and be signposted if not,who specialises in these sorts of themes (medical trauma/growing up with undiagnosed ADHD and autism and the trauma this can cause or has caused in my case. 

Thank you so much if you read this far. Forgot to mention I have some savings and Im considering private if I can afford it"

The thing is I grew up believing I was a smart person. I cant reconcile the person I was as a very promising kid with how I have ended up. And I have no idea if Im super-entitled or legitimately grieving. Im considering going to a therapist to ask if I may be a narcisist? I also feel a lot of resentment towards therapists because they usually come from a much better background than I do. I am so confused. I used to think of myself, and come off as levelheaded but traumatized person. This latest therapy-relation brought out a lot of weird reactions that I dont really recognize in my self at all.

CPTSD,Struggles with sexuality. (long post),18xqflr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xqflr/struggles_with_sexuality_long_post/,https://www.reddit.com/user/moonrider18,moonrider18,2024-01-03 18:40:18,Struggles with sexuality. (long post),"I'm not an SA victim. Nobody molested me. 

But sexuality has still been a very difficult thing for me. I'd like to give voice to my struggles and hopefully find (and provide) some validation.

----

***Religion, Part 1***

When I was young I was highly compliant and I trusted the adults in my life *way* too much. The adults gave me a book called The Bible and told me it was the word of God. I took this *super* seriously, which became a real problem. In Matthew 5:27-28 it says that ""any man who looks at a woman with lust in his heart has committed adultery.""

And then I hit puberty. And I *hated* myself.

----

***Religion, Part 2***

There are many layers to this. For one thing, my religious feelings were actually pretty mild in my earlier years, and I wasn't raised fundamentalist. My parents didn't scream about Being A Good Christian or anything like that. I wasn't forcefully reminded that hellfire awaited me if I sinned.

But around the age of 12, I got involved in Youth Group at church.

At this point you're probably thinking ""Oh, so you had a terrible, fundamentalist youth group!"" But I *didn't*! Certainly not in the way most people would picture it, anyway. Our youth pastor was incredibly warm, playful and approachable. I connected with him like no other adult I knew. He never abused me and I never heard a direct accusation of him abusing anyone else.

This warm, empathetic man just...believed in the Bible. Believed in it absolutely. And I followed his example. I truly, truly believed.

He ended up moving away before puberty really hit me. Maybe if he'd been around he would've told me not to hate myself so much. I don't know exactly. He'd probably be the type to say ""Well, God forgives you"" while still maintaining that the Bible was literally true and therefore, yes, technically I *had* committed adultery by having sexual thoughts. And that still would've crushed me.

In any case, I was only my own with only the Bible to guide me, and the Bible was very clear, and I *hated* myself.

----

***Parents***

And there are more threads beyond that, of course. When I awkwardly asked my parents about masturbation, they gave me what I assume is the standard awkward speech that parents give to their children, which was basically ""This is socially taboo but we don't exactly hate you for it. Pay attention to what they teach you in health class.""

So again, not a fundamentalist thing at all. But I could see that they were uncomfortable, and I was *highly* sensitive to their feelings, and anyway the Bible said that I was wrong just for *thinking* things, let alone *doing* things...

And there were more layers too. I'd long since learned to suppress my own thoughts and emotions, to conform to what other people wanted from me. Sexual thoughts were so powerful that they *scared* me. It felt like mind control, and I doubled down on self-control to keep the thoughts at bay.

----

***Scrupulosity***

Then there was my extreme scrupulosity. When I struggled with sexuality in my teenage years, I constantly reminded myself of all the women in the world who felt objectified and how some of them developed anorexia just to maximize their sexuality. I felt *extremely* guilty for contributing to these problems in any way.

So I started digging my nails into my skin whenever I had sexual thoughts. I started screaming at myself in my own head, night after night. I thought that this discipline was highly moral on my part. I had no idea it was highly self-destructive.

----

***Stress***

*Another* layer to this is that I was extremely stressed out about grades, which is where my parents put their focus. Good Grades were necessary for a Good Life, in their view. (Ironically the pursuit of good grades led me to a nervous breakdown and I've had a *bad* life as a result...) I was *also* stressed by such things as my younger siblings fighting and it was my job to deal with them because my parents were neglectful and I was parentified.

My point is, since I was already so stressed, and since sexuality can serve to reduce stress, my sexual feelings were probably even *stronger* than they normally are for a teenager.

----

***Culture***

I cannot describe the incredible amount of pain and shame I endured, trying to suppress my sexuality.

It didn't help that I had zero healthy role models for sexuality. As a culture, this isn't something that we want to talk about.

And if anyone discusses sexuality with a *teenager*, that's considered a sign of pedophilia. And yes, there are pedophiles out there! There are abusers! I know! But there are also self-hating kids like me who need someone to tell them that it's ok to have sexual fantasies so long as you aren't hurting anyone. The best info I ever got was how to avoid STDs; nobody ever taught me how to handle the emotional side of things. Nobody had anything to say about how sexuality can be an expression of your personality, as opposed to being this weird alien mind control thing that makes people feel awkward and gives you STDs and causes girls to have anorexia and makes God disappointed in you and every other bad thing under the sun.

----

***Time***

It's been a couple of decades, and I'm still a virgin, and honestly that hurts. And it also hurts to know that if I say ""I'm male and I'm a virgin"" there's a certain group of people who will just *assume* that I'm a Misogynistic Asshole Who Only Thinks Of Women As Objects.

At my local library, I once saw a book on the shelf called ""All Men Are Jerks (Until Proven Otherwise)."" That hurt me.

I told a friend about my struggles in finding a date, and she said ""Just please tell me you won't become one of those incels"". That hurt. (Imagine if you told a friend that you had financial struggles, and she said ""Just please tell me that you won't start robbing banks"".)

I'm not religious anymore, but I'm highly sensitive to the idea that women are secretly afraid of me and they're just too polite to say so. That terrifies me, and it makes it hard to approach anyone.

Dating sites get me nowhere, perhaps because I don't have the emotional stamina to get dozens of rejections so I quickly stop trying.

Recently I told a new friend how I'm still a virgin at this age, and he suggested that I'm asexual. HA. I wish. The fact is that sexuality is important to me, and I know now that it can be a fun, tender and loving thing. But I have no idea where to find a partner, and my therapists have never known either.

----

***Struggles***

I'd actually be interested in hiring a Sexual Surrogate if possible. These people are essentially therapist/prostitutes; they help the client deal with their emotions around sex and that includes actually having sex with them when the time is right. But the legality of Sexual Surrogates is dubious where I live, and there aren't any anywhere near me.

And I can't just find a regular prostitute on the black market, because that industry is full of abuse and I do *not* want to participate in that.

Of course I could just get a girlfriend, right?? Except I don't know how. Everybody just says ""Try a dating site!"" and ""Do activities!"" and ""Just be yourself! and I've been *trying* all that as best I can for a decade now with little success. I had one relationship that lasted a couple years until she broke up with me. She was too shy for sex, and I never pushed her, never expressed any resentment about it. Honestly I was glad just to go on dates and cuddle now and then.

But she left me eventually, she said I hadn't done anything wrong, I was just not the right fit for her personally. I accepted that. We agreed to just be friends.

And then later, I spoke to a girl my age in a public place, and that girl smiled and said something nice in return and then walked away. I wondered ""Could I have kept talking to that girl?"" My (female) therapist said yes, but my ex gave me a hard no. When I tried to press the point and said my therapist disagreed with her, my ex said I sounded like some sort of incel and she ended our friendship permanently.

I'm hurt. And I'm very scared that this is *never* going to work out for me.

...I'm also scared that somebody is going to yell at me in the comments, saying that I'm not a woman and I don't understand the pain of women and therefore my pain is invalid and I'm probably some sort of Misogynist Asshole Who Treats Women Like Objects.

I found these essays validating:

***Conclusion***

People tell me that I'm worthy of love. And that's the main thing I want: love. But it's not sinful to want sex too, is it? Can't sex be a positive, loving experience? Aren't I worthy of that too? Is ok for me to have these desires?

All these years later, and I'm still struggling. =("

I’ve seen people argue it’s for doing the most we can and feeling the most fun. But that’s not satisfying, that’s basically don’t think about it too much just live love laugh. I’m in a genuine state of crisis where whenever I look at my life down the line I genuinely don’t get the point of anything living having kids working, we all die and dissipate into nothing. Why not cut the suffering short if this is the case, becuase realistically life is a lot more suffering than it is joy at least to me. Joy is just a rare moment in a passing month. 

Why should I keep fighting to live, and try. What is there even to try for. Something completely meaningless like the happiness of a weekend. Nothing actually means anything. After being so long dissociated I understand that everything we feel and think of is just made up. None of this actually means anything. 

I feel so terrible and hopeless about life and what I’m here for. How do I get out of this…."

I had two personal blows, a financial one and then found I’m pre-diabetic at 34, I exercise and eat pretty healthy. I also I had low iron symptoms for over a year and my old doctor blew me off with “anxiety”. Finally found out I was low iron last week thought that was all they found then had a receptionist ring me up to say I’m pre-diabetic. I have health anxiety so it’s my worst nightmare finding out something is wrong. I’ve cut out all carbs etc but that’s hugely triggering as I used to be bulimic/anorexic subtype. 

There’s a lot more to my story, but it’s long and probably tedious to read. I just feel so emotionally exhausted with life, I feel like I attract negative situations by just being me. My therapist keeps saying you’ve had a lot of bad luck, but what does that mean? Am I unlucky, sometimes I feel I am a terrible person and life is punishing me, like I must have done something awful in a past life and that’s why these things happened. 

I went to therapy today and I cried for the first time in a session which felt ok but the rest of the session ended up with me defending why I don’t trust doctors very much, which I think wasted time when I wanted to focus on expressing my emotions which I struggle to do in therapy. 

I feel so alone even though people are around me. I don’t feel safe in this world, or in this body at all."

Is that a trauma response or just my adhd brain? 

My therapist often asks ""how old where you when this happened"" or ""what year did that happen"" and I have absolutely no forking clue.

Ive always had a problem remembering dates, like I always forget peoples birthdays unless I put a reminder in my phone, but I also dont remember any important dates from my past. Like, if you asked me what I did on my 16th birthday, I actually couldnt tell you. 

I recently talked to a bunch of other women who all remembered exactly when and where they were when they got their first period and I have zero memory of that which they all found weird. Things like this happen often and they make me feel excluded from perfectly normal conversations.

Im also bad at telling stories because I feel like my brain changed so much to protect me, that Im not sure what really happened anymore.

I often feel like I only exist in this moment and my past belongs to someone else.

We struggled at the beginning of our relationship because of the mixed signals he would send me, essentially he did not know what he wanted and had just come out of a relationship (which I only found out later on, after we had a brief break because I did not want to spend time with someone whose energy is so inconsistent). We have now established boundaries around our relationship, one of them being exclusivity. Regardless, he still does something that stresses me out. We live three hours apart from each other so we always sleep over for at least two days when we see each other, which is always beautiful and intense (in a good way). Once I go home or he does, he doesn't text me or takes hours to one entire day to text me back. For example, he does not ask me how I got home or whatever else there would be to ask or to answer. We have had a lot of conflict because of mixed signals and unpredictability from his part, he knows that it is a problem for me. I just realised today how much it triggers and stresses me out. It reminds me so much of how I felt with my abusive parents, yet I know it's incomparable. But I think the fact that it's hot and cold from one second to another triggers me and to be honest, it makes me want to end things. It's like after almost every time I see him, I feel stressed and doubtful. We get along really well and I really like him a lot, but this particular thing drives me insane. I don't know if it is the unpredictability factor because of my PTSD or if I am exaggerating and self sabotaging, but I did not feel/behave like this with my ex-boyfriend who also didn't behave like the guy now. I don't know if I am overreacting by thinking about ending things. Can anyone relate or give me advice on how they handled struggling with situations like this?"

The last few years have been really hard for me, and I've been on several medications for depression and in and out of therapy and honestly none of it really works. The therapy is almost always too surface level for me to get anywhere with my healing and medications only seem to work for me for a few months and then they have to start upping my dose or changing my medication when I've maxed out. For perspective, at one point I was on 250mg of trazadone and still not sleeping through the night.

I have been testing out telling a certain friend when things they do bother me. Sometimes because I’m setting a boundary and sometimes just to express my feelings (something I’m focusing on, to show myself ‘negative’ feelings are okay to have and all feelings are neutral, not morally coded.) I’m always kind and gentle with expressing these things and reception seems good for the most part.

The issue I’m having is that so many things they do bother me and emotionally trigger me on some level.

I’m struggling with the fear of being too needy, or emotional, or sensitive, and making my friend feel constantly criticized by me. Like they can do no right or maybe I just don’t like who they are.

I wonder that myself sometimes. I’ve had this friend since I was 16 and they have done a lot of things that actually created, solidified or worsened some triggers for me in my teens. They struggle a lot with their mental health and I’ve poured so much of myself into supporting them all these years.

I feel like we have a good connection and we share a lot of the same interests, but I don’t think I trust them to not hurt me in the ways they have in the past so I struggle to really open up to them. Some basic things they say make me spiral because I feel so unseen with them while actively hiding myself. I’m trying to remedy it by speaking up but like I said, it feels like there’s SO MUCH they do that bothers me.

The thought of ending the friendship has crossed my mind over the years, and I did distance myself for a while, but we’re spending more time together the past year and connecting more. I love them and want them in my life so I’m investing in them by trying these things but part of me doesn’t want to fully let them in.

Despite having her faults like every other human, she is one of the best people I ever heard of. The last decade of her life she spent volunteering for people with certain pain conditions, making sure they have access to the newest scientific information, giving advice and comfort. But that's not all. She raised someone who had run away from an abusive home, had a rescue dog, was a great artist and always kept her eyes open to see where she could help.

That's how I met her. I'm not sure I'd still be alive without her. While having moved out as soon as I turned 18, I was still in contact with my abusive family and had two incidents where one of them wanted to kill me between moving out and meeting her. She contacted me when I was stuck in a bad hospital to help me trough. During our conversations she felt that there was more behind it. So she created a safe space for me to talk and lead me to tell her. She explained to me the gaslighting and manipulation that kept me a victim. She comforted me. She made me realise I have the same rights as every other human being. She helped me to get away from what I was raised to believe and develop self worth. She pointed out that I was showing clear signs of CPTSD and motivated me to get help. It was also her, who recognised I had a second pain disorder I didn't know about and encouraged me during the journey to get a diagnosis (I had shied away from that as the pain had been belittled for years).

This woman changed my life and probably saved it. And now she is gone. The world lost a truly amazing person who made it her life goal to help others. 

I made the resolution to follow her footsteps as well as I can and to make a positive impact on the life of others. And I will fight to overcome the CPTSD and live up to the potential she saw in me.

In answering a commentary I realised that there's something I haven't mentioned in my post: My account name goes back to something she said. She encouraged me by saying ""You're like a dandelion, growing through concrete and blossoming against all odds."" That stuck with me and is a reminder that I'm not weak, but strong and resilient. "

A big reason is we've heard since childhood that PTSD is for soldiers.   

But I think another good reason may be when it's persistent over a long time, like it can often be with CPTSD, we get used to it.  It becomes our normal and we may not even think there's something wrong.  

Also, if you're having re-experiencing in dreams instead of flashbacks, the nightmares are 'thematically' related to the traumatic events (see link below).  We might think PTSD means dreaming of only the exact events.  

Another reason is that flashbacks can happen in a way where we're not cognitively aware of the past event when we're re-experiencing it, we just have the same intense emotions as the event.  But for PTSD and CPTSD, that's one of the ways re-experiencing can happen.

My earliest trauma was around 8-10 years old; it was mainly emotional and physical neglect and witnessing multiple violent abuses. (separate from this topic) It started when I went on dating apps at 14; I showed my face. I was groomed by a 25-year-old man who manipulated me into dating him at 16 years old. I gained a lot of weight and then lost it at 17 due to stress; I escaped him to be with another man. That other man I trusted eventually raped me. I was with him for almost four years. I would drink and take drugs with him and on my own. 

This whole part of my life was very chaotic. I never got help; I told people about it I trusted. They shrugged it off. Whenever I remember, it feels weird, like it didn't happen because I was silenced and dismissed. I don't know what to do with this pain. This deep feeling as though a part of me was damaged, stolen, taken advantage of and abused. A part of me that is no longer there.

Without understanding and taking into consideration my sociocultural situation they started pathologising me and diagnosing me.
Asking intrusive questions about why am I lonely, it certainly has to be a character pathology that I don’t have a partner etc. (Even in the DSM they warn not to diagnose patients if their “symptoms” are not caused by mental health problems but are products of socioeconomical situation). 

So, if you are just lonely, because of the things you couldn’t possibly control, you simply won’t get help. Help is only for those with mental health issues, and if you don’t have any, they will diagnose you anyway."

This is the straw that broke the camels back. 


I deleted my other posts but long story short - I stood up for my nibbling who was being abused and my family cut me off. My mum got sick and no one told me she was sick or dying until after she died. Dad gave the excuse of having no time to think, too much to do, but had time to get family from hours away, but didn't tell me my mum was dying 5 minutes away from my house. He wanted me to go to the funeral and I did, where everyone ignored me. 


Since then, dad and I have tried to have a relationship. We text every couple of weeks, go for lunch or a drink (he drinks) every other month or so. We try to talk. I'm really trying. But I see that he's completely uninterested in everything I say. I don't know if maybe I'm just completely boring and that's why his eyes glaze over whenever I open my mouth, or if he genuinely just doesn't care. It was the same way whenever I tried to talk to mum. It hurts. 


When she died, I asked for one thing of hers. I didn't want anything expensive. My siblings got all of her jewellery, her wedding rings etc. 

She had this costume jewellery necklace that she gave me when I was a teenager. She wore it when we were really young. I wore it when I was young. I left it there when I moved out years ago. But it was important to me. I asked dad for it. He said he had seen it, and that he'd bring it me. 


Weeks went by, and he didn't. I eventually asked again and he said it was broken so he threw it out. I was heartbroken and I cried after. One thing. I asked for one thing. I didn't care if it was broken. I could have fixed it. Or even if I couldn't, it didn't matter. I only asked for one thing... 


I tried to move past it. Maybe he didn't think about it the same way I did. I mean, I got over him not telling me mum was dying, I can get over him throwing away her broken necklace... And I did. 


He spent mums birthday, 6 month anniversary, his birthday, sibs birthdays, Christmas all together. I was alone for all of them, including my own birthday. 


Then a stupid tiktok came up on my page. My nibling. Wearing mums necklace. But maybe it's a coincidence. Maybe it's just similar... Then more tiktoks, and I'm sure it's the necklace. And everything in me wants to ask him. But I know if I do, he will lie. And I also know, that I'm at the metaphorical fork in the road. Because this is my breaking point. Part of me doesn't want to know the truth, because how can he do that to me? One thing. I asked for one singular thing of mum's. It meant nothing to anyone but me and her. It holds no monetary or sentimental value to anyone but us. How can he do that to me? So I tell myself not to ask... Because I don't think I can forgive this. I forgave the worst already... This is just lower than low right? (or am I completely overreacting???) 



Today I saw my nibling. And I didn't mean to. I really didn't. But it was like word vomit and the words just fell out of my mouth. I asked if it was nanny's necklace. They said it was, and how grandad just knew it was something they'd love. How much they love it.

I didn't make it a big deal, I told them how happy I am to see it again, that they get to wear it and remember nanny. That it suits them. I didn't tell them that dad promised it me. And I am truly happy for them. But my heart is broken for me and I feel selfish. They all have so many things of my mums. I only wanted one thing. One thing that meant so much to me. And he gave it away and my heart is hurting. 


I have forgiven so very much in this family. So so much abuse and manipulation and terrible things that no one should ever do. But I don't think I can move past this. But it feels ridiculous to blow up over a piece of costume jewellery. But I'm done. I'm so so done. I'm so hurt right now. 


Am I overreacting? Please help me sort through my feelings here because I'm completely lost..."

I admire the fact that he was able to pull himself out of the s*ithole he was in and to get to almost superhuman levels of fitness. I admire his fortitude.

I am writing this all as a person who was able to go from having had a mild disability statement due to suspicion of muscular dystrophy (which fortunately turned out not to be the case) to doing half- marathons. 

What I really dislike is the fact that he is so obnoxious about it - like, seriously, people who do sub 2h marathons like Kipchogee or Kiptum are a total, polar opposite - they are reserved, humble and likeable.
The thing that I believe is dangerous about this guy is that he promotes an approach that is unsustainable - to abuse your body and do the physical activity not because you like it but through dissociating from your sensations. Like, seriously, doing a 100mi race to break your feet and pee blood in urine is not something that I would like to preach to anyone as a viable fitness goal...
His behaviour and especially this of his followers is also really condescending towards people who struggle with variety of stuff and perhaps do not have the resources to ""pull themselves by their bootstraps"" like he managed to do.

Everyone around me travels domestically or internationally multiple times a year and I can't relate any more. In my 20's I went on three trips to South East Asia for 1-3 months at a time, and would travel to another city in my country a few times a year. I'm now in my mid 30's with severe travel anxiety.

Honestly it was always really hard, and often I would fly home earlier then expected and cut trips short due to high anxiety/depression symptoms and feeling shaky and insecure all the time. But I guess being younger I would still take the risk, but now the fear has taken over.

The last few years I've been in and out of therapy exploring my CPTSD symptoms, and honestly I haven't got very far. I've had long periods of housing/financial/mental health instability that have come and gone in waves and at the moment my money and housing is ok so I want to seize the moment and go on a trip but all the cptsd/and depression stuff makes me want to isolate myself and stick with what I already know instead of going out and exploring.

Do people here travel much? And how do you manage your symptoms while you're travelling?"

I've been labelled as having anxiety for a decade and OCD was queried more recently, but treatment for GAD and OCD isn't really doing much for me at all.

The only thing I'm questioning myself on before bringing this up to my therapist is that my trauma isn't bad enough for it to be a post traumatic stress thing? I had some bad parts to my childhood, sure, but I was never beaten or anything like that.

For context, my parents divorced when I was 2 (I'm 23 now) and there has been animosity between them for my entire life. Custody was split 50/50 and I was often left to be the messenger, arranging my own childcare. I would get criticised for forgetting my parents plans etc when I was only like, 10.

My mum is sort of like a teenager in an adult's body. I've seen her scream at her partners, her mood would change rapidly and unexpectedly and she would guilt trip me frequently. She had multiple different boyfriends who would be prioritised over me, they were all unstable relationships. I've been taken out of my bed as a child before for my mum to argue with her boyfriend in a carpark in the middle of the night. 

I've seen the holes kicked in the walls and been told of glasses being thrown, doors being kicked down etc. I know my mum kicked my dad with her heels and slapped him before. Never saw those things myself but I was aware of them.

I've been left in a tent unattended as a 12 year old because my mum was too drunk to stand up, and she pushed me away and told me to fuck off when I tried to help her. She then disappeared into a bar for hours. Had my first panic attack because I thought the men she went in the bar with might rape her. She didn't care about my panic attack when she eventually came back and went to sleep.

My mum loudly had sex with her ex boyfriends with me in the house, I would have panic attacks. She got angry at me for asking her to be quiet because it was making me really uncomfortable (I was about 14 then).

My parents would compare me to each other when they were mad at me. My mum would frequently ditch me with my dad when she had plans, or drag me along to parties/events that were not massively child friendly at times. My mum also abandoned me when I was 17 as she uprooted her life suddenly and moved to another part of the country with her boyfriend at the time. She did a lot of things wrong, but I was extremely attached to her and this was devastating.

A big thing is that my mum would sort of treat me as a friend or a therapist? She's clung to me and sobbed during break ups and arguments, she's unloaded her relationship issues on me and I've had to interrupt her arguments to calm her and her partner down. 

I had plenty of stability and good experiences with my dad as well though. And like I said, nobody ever hit me or properly abused me. There was just a lot of abandonment and I suppose arguably some neglect? Sorry for the long rant, just needed someone to see this."

My father admitted to not feeling any emotions like fear or guilt which lead me to multiple epiphanies.,"I spent a long time really blinded by my love and adoration for my father. If he said jump, I would ask how high.  However, I started to hate him beginning in 2021 and after a huge blow out fight earlier this year, I went no contact with everyone in my huge family. I just disappeared. 

Something that stood out during our fight is that he said he didn’t feel any fear during a medical emergency that put him in a coma. He said he felt nothing but wanted to get through it “for his kids.”

The weird thing is he has never really done anything for us. He didn’t work hard or sacrifice for us. He married women he could control that abused the kids he brought into this world. He did enough to trick them into marrying them before using their money and homes as his own. He never protected us from his abusive partners, he just said enough to make it seem like he was on our side before going right back to staying with them. Our safety and wellbeing was never his priority, controlling us through any means necessary was. 

I realized after our fight that he would sort of say whatever he could to do damage control. Him and my mom would talk shit about me together, my mom cussed me out after I had a fight with my dad a few days later after initially being understanding of it. She was saying things like “your father doesn’t understand how you could yell at him, he doesn’t even know what he did, he’s a good man!” This was after we were lamenting about his lifelong misogyny and neglect during one moment of peace between us. I realized he would shit talk me to my mom and anyone around him for damage control. Once I went NC, I also have had flashbacks to him sexually abusing me. 

My mom was so overtly unwell that he seemed safe despite never express a human emotion in his life. He had never expressed a true emotion, he manipulated people to get what he wants, he showcases antisocial behaviors, and I realize I know nothing about him on a deep level. He hides it and gets made when you react to him hurting or neglecting you. 

Have you had a parent that appeared normal to you in childhood but ultimately got a clear picture of the truth as you got older?"

Like literally the same tiny, remote town a very long way from here, to do the same specific nature excursion. Just…by themselves, without me, and no acknowledgement of the fact that this is the exact trip I’d planned and invited my friend to. 

??? 

Am I not supposed to feel really slighted by this? It’s so weird.

CPTSD,Acceptance and Commitment therapy is the secret to healing,18xj6fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xj6fi/acceptance_and_commitment_therapy_is_the_secret/,https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Warning_4000,No_Warning_4000,2024-01-03 13:16:52,Acceptance and Commitment therapy is the secret to healing,"
Do you accept your negative thoughts or do you judge them?

Do you accept that you have anxiety or do you hate yourself for it?

Do you accept the person you see in the mirror?

Do you judge yourself when you judge others?

Do you argue with yourself in your head?

Do you judge yourself for being “broken”?

Do you think that your thoughts should be all positive and judge yourself when you feel or think something negative?

When we reject our experience of the world, this includes thoughts and feelings, we reject ourselves. This rejection of self is no different and perhaps worse than when we are rejected from society. 

Therapies I tried that didn’t help: EDMR, IFS, DBT, and CBT. I tried these therapies for over a year with very little progress in my panic disorder and still found my past to be extremely triggering. 

After just 1 month of acceptance and commitment therapy, I managed to successfully prevent an oncoming panic attack for the first time in 3 years. I cried tears of joy because this has never happened before. I felt hopeful for the first time in my life. I’ve also been able to recall past traumatic memories without dissociating. My confidence is rising, my self worth is increasing. And I’m beginning to integrate my traumatized past. 

About acceptance and commitment therapy: It was founded by a doctor called Steven Hayes who also struggled with panic attacks. The therapy takes a lot of Buddhist practices on mindfulness and puts it into a therapy environment. It’s all about accepting yourself as you are. Accepting the good and the bad. It sounds so simple but because of our western culture, this is something we are not taught.

I can’t believe something so simple is what has been changing my brain, after spending so much money on complex therapies this is what works for me. I hope this can help someone else ❤️

Had a break up a few months ago. Am 39, not my first break up, but I can’t keep doing this anymore. Also dealt with health issues the past 2 yrs and having had surgery and realizing friends don’t seem to want to step up to help even when it’s necessary, I just don’t see a lot of reasons to stick around anymore. Combined with the state of the world, not finding joy in anything anymore, just wanting things to be done already..

I’ve cycled through active and passive si for years, always reached out for help when it became active. I never attempted, only planned. When I get really really low it’s usually hormonal, suspect pmdd, and one or two days later I feel better again, but am not in that part of my cycle. 
If in some days I still feel as bad as I do now, I’ll be going to the spot I chose. It’s a 90m tall building, with my bodyweight it will take 5.6 seconds. I’ve started to write down passwords and such so family can access my laptop, phone and bank accounts. There’s not much more to arrange I think. Some outstanding bills can be paid from savings, the rest I think they inherit automatically. I have a college debt which I hope will just be annulled. Feels better just to write this all out.

All my life I have chased emotionally unavailable people, I really feel sorry for my inner child that finds the long lost rather non existent warmth and comfort of earlier times, whenever someone shows even a hint of interest in my life.
Right now all I can feel is pity for myself for how helpless I find myself. Day in and day out I am surrounded by people but I’ve failed to form a connection where I can just be myself.
I have spent a lot of time and money to change something that seems to be destined for me.
No amount of self-care can make up for the lack of having any form of support.

I feel like I'm not human or something when the advice is so completely far off from anything I needed to hear. It makes the feeling of not belonging so much worse since the so highly held resources supposedly available are completely useless for me and I'm just left wondering what the hell is so wrong or different about me that makes it like this. Is it really just me or is the advice actually not productive for anyone else? I honestly don't know if I'm just crazy at this point. 

For some examples of what advice I'm talking about things like ""you ONLY need yourself to love you"", ""exercise/meditate""(that one is particularly unhelpful when it's the only thing that's continually repeated when I'm looking for actual support), ""get support from your family/friends"" (just reminds me of how I don't have that no matter how much I try to make some), ""don't try, let everything come to you"" (left here waiting my whole life for things that I need but don't come by easily), ""tell an authority figure"" (code for get sent to be traumatized more at a mental hospital), ""know you are loved"" (by who? Santa Claus? Or did you mean abusers?

""I was sent to a very poorly planned treatment for Complex PTSD due to budget cuts in the health system.

My nerve system is constantly activated, and I am always on fight or flight mode, as I don't need any external triggers, I get triggered by the flashbacks.

About two years ago I tried CBD oil, which helped somewhat as it helped with the flashbacks, I went up to the maximum reccomended dose, reccomended by the CBD supplier.

About one year ago I started to use cannbis, that also helped to relax my nerve system, for a more stable effect I started to vape the cannabis. 

I just purchased a decarboxylator and made butter, I have never experienced such a stable effect. 

What I wanted to ask the people that use medicinal marijuana and are dependent on it for daily use, is how do you go about avoding tolerance build up as taking a break isn't really possible. 

I've read that changing consumption method can help, switching from smoking, to vaping to edibles.

Last night, I had a very intense nightmare in which I was trying to tell my mom and aunt I had (possibly) gotten sexually abused as a child, and when I was about to tell my aunt she said I know something happened to you as a child, a man took advantage of you. And I started screaming in my nightmare in terror and when I woke up it was like that emotional scream came from deep within and I was paralysed in fear. I couldn’t go back to sleep after that till the morning, I was really disturbed and hypervigilant all night.

I want these type of old people who basically had no idea what emotions were and just felt so stable. Sometimes I wonder if being too concious about emotions and self-awareness is bad in some ways. Because you analyze everything."

It was done by my classmates.

I've had trouble with people touching me since I was a kid, I would become aggressive for some reason which came to the light again when I was 12. I was very withdrawn but defensive and this situation kinda made me snap. I would regularly slap my classmates and threaten them but I never told teachers or my parents. When I was 13, it was more intense. Instead of regular slapping, I was touched a lot by a classmate who showed ASPD like tendencies and he was much bigger than anyone else at the school really. On multiple occasions, I've slapped him as well impulsively and the rage he had to contain not to crush me was enough for me to notice in his eyes and stance. I was afraid of him. I begged them all to stop and my anger issues were at peak when I was 13. I thought this wouldn't affect me a lot but I developed ED somewhere around that age, I was already affected when I was 13.

Last night, I've had a similar dream, being touched without a consent. In the dream, I was confused, angry, isolated, alone and ashamed, even threatened. So I threatened him and told him if he did that again, it would be the last thing he's done and I've started digging my nails into his arm that it was eventually cut out.

Maybe as I'm trying to recover from a relapse in ED and the eventual weight gain made me feel exposed again. It's as if the more woman like I look, the more looks I attract and the more I'm in danger. Maybe I was finally ready to address how angry and disrespected I've felt and most of all, the shame I carried. The shame around my body and inability to adequately defend myself leading me to think I'm the weakest individual on the planet. The loneliness I've felt in all that.

CPTSD,Shamed for being sick gives me flashbacks,18xe6re,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xe6re/shamed_for_being_sick_gives_me_flashbacks/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Kinkystormtrooper,Kinkystormtrooper,2024-01-03 08:05:50,Shamed for being sick gives me flashbacks,"My mother always downplayed when I was sick. Forcing me to go to school, or making me wake up at 3 am to wait Infront of the doctors office for 4 hours in the freezing cold. She would always treat me worse when I was sick, yelling at me when I was coughing, didn't let me enter the room she was in so I wouldn't spread my sickness to her. A lot of times she would refuse to give me medication, even when I had terrible fever. She would treat me like I'm doing it on purpose.

What lasts is shame when I am sick, that I am not even that sick and that I should be ashamed to leave my coworkers with more work. I should suck it up and still go, which I did for many years. But now I am at a point where I want to heal and prioritise myself, so if I'm sick and have a doctor's note, I stay home. The shame remains and the feeling that I will be abandoned.

My supervisor wrote me today ""it's now the 3rd time you're sick when Christian is on holiday. I'm really saddened. No one is there who can do the documents. I'm on vacation and this is really upsetting me now."" 

I know technically that it's their fault for not training more people. And that it's not my fault and I am not doing it on purpose. However the shame gets much worse with her words, same with being scared they will fire me and I will end up homeless. 

I really hope that I will receive my 50% disability soon, as then they can't fire me for being sick anymore. 

Does anyone else feel this way?"
CPTSD,something i wrote at 16,18xdux9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18xdux9/something_i_wrote_at_16/,https://www.reddit.com/user/onetwentyoneguns_,onetwentyoneguns_,2024-01-03 07:44:35,something i wrote at 16,"The night before my 16th birthday, she accused me of stealing her keys (which were used to padlock every door in the house at night so i couldn’t escape or wander around the house.) 

She had misplaced them while she was screaming at me, a crumpled up ball on the bathroom floor. My dad was telling her to back off but she wouldn’t listen. She screamed at me, made me and my dad search the house for them. When I couldn’t find them, she told me she was going to keep me home and not let me go to the mall with my boyfriend and our friends for my birthday. I was hyperventilating, crying, searching for these stupid fucking keys. She refused to search for them. She just sat on the couch with a smug smirk on her face while she watched us look. “I know you took them, Ava.” She kept saying.

I finally found them in a drawer in the bathroom. I guess she’d shoved them in there while she was bullying me. I was so happy to have found them, so I grabbed them and gave them to her. Instead of thanking me, like any normal human being would, she raged. She accused me of taking them from her (while she was screaming at me!!) and hiding them from her. I was begging her to believe me. My dad was trying to defend me, which turned into them screaming at each other. I went outside barefoot (it was January) and sat out in the cold. There was an abandoned lot where a house had burned down next door. That was always my solace whenever I had to escape. 

My dad came out and tried to coax me back in; I refused, and I remember I started going off on him. Asking him why the fuck did he not love me enough to leave her? I remember telling him i hated him, and he had failed me by allowing me to be abused by my own mother. I told him he was a worthless dad, to let me live this way. He let me finish, and these next few words changed my whole life; 

“I wish you wouldn’t say that shit to me. It’s not true, because I just told her she needed to get the fuck out.” 

I didn’t know what to do. I was shocked. I think i started crying and hugging him. He asked me to come back in; again the answer was no. He went back inside and a few minutes later, two cop cars pulled up. They started questioning me, apparently my mom had called the cops on my dad because she was “scared of him.” That man never layed a hand on her. One of the cops went inside to my parents and the other stayed outside with me. He told me I needed to find somewhere else to stay for the night because I wasn’t safe there. So I went inside to get my shit to go to my friends’ house. When I walked in, she glared at me and started screaming at me again . I remember her saying “This is exactly what you wanted, huh? I bet you’re happy now! You’re ruining my marriage so you can fuck your dad, good job Ava!” I just laughed at her. I told her she was insane. And then I left. The cops threatened to arrest her for belligerent behavior because even they were disgusted.

I stayed at my friend’s house that night. She called me all night. I refused to pick up the phone, so she started texting my friend’s phone, asking to speak to me, saying she was sorry. I ignored her. The next day at school she tried to come pick me up early to “take me to therapy.” (An old white lady on my mom’s side who agreed with my mom I was off the rails and insane. This woman was accusing me and my 15 year old friends and boyfriend of being in a gang when we live in rural tennessee, and was in psychosis due to a health issue. She accused us of bugging our whole house to hack it, pawned all my items, and boarded up my window when i never escaped without permission except to sit in the backyard and stargaze.) 

The issue wasnt me. It was my mother. I tried to refuse going home with her as long as I could, but the guidance counselor told me if I didn’t go home I had to go to a shelter, so I finally gave up and went to leave with her. As I was walking up to her from behind, I heard her saying to a few of the guidance counselors/school police officers “Ava’s a liar. You can’t trust anything she says. She has some serious issues- just be patient with her.” This absolutely fucking infuriated me. 

It was an awful sweet 16. She ran off with another man a month later.

the first time we were intimate, i had a strong emotional response and i’m not sure if i had told him i had ptsd at that point but his automatic response was to hold me and tell me that i’m safe with him. he just knows the right thing to do. 

last night, unprompted, before bed we were close together and the last thing he said before passing out was “i’ll keep you safe”

i’m appalled by the contrast between this and my previous relationships where a year into dating, i didn’t even feel like i could cry around my partner. anything i would have hid from them, i can talk to him about. he is so special and i tell him how much i appreciate him every day!!


i am actively trying not to say that im “spoiled” by this relationship because i feel it implies i don’t deserve this level of kindness. and its even been difficult to accept at times but

i am generally proud of myself for allowing myself to have what i deserve in a partner."

I have now had a year of cbt-therapy to relearn to be alright with feeling feelings, having arguments and such.

I still have high anxiety, I get kinda flashbacks but they are more like feelings than images. Like it can be rather every day type of memories that follows an intense feeling of shame. It’s like I’m there when the memory happens but it’s not a dangerous memory. Just a super intense feeling of shame, regret,  sometimes fear.

There are other stuff as well, anyway the cbt have helped but not gotten rid of my problems and now I have just started taking escitalopram. It’s not the most fun experience to start with, I kinda feel like shit but it’s supposed to sort itself out.

But I need to take this for a couple of months and have trauma focused cpt where I revisit the memories to “get used to them”. But I don’t really know how that’s gonna work when the images themself isn’t “dangerous”. I mean I can think about the situation or at least some of them whitout triggering anything but then when they pop up in my head with images, sounds it still brings that sting feeling of shame.

Im starting to think I’m just making everything up."

If you want more context to how my family is please look at the previous post on this account. Also I didn’t note this in the original post but I am 14 so I probably don’t understand a lot yet but I’m realising a lot of stuff pretty early so I want some help from more experienced people. 

So, very funnily enough.. after I got back home my mother breached my trust AGIAN. She did her “meltdown” thing where she moves my entire room around because it was a bit messy and because “I can’t keep my room clean so I don’t deserve to have a choice.” After 4 days of anxiety and realising how fucked up my family is I totally exploded. At first it was just terror where I said “what’s wrong with you…?” And she would say “well what’s wrong with YOU?” 
I rambled on about how I didn’t trust her anymore and how I had to stop caring about her because she made everything feel like my fault for years, or how my old crappy therapist sided with her and made me feel like a bad person I’ve told two of my current therapist how bad she was and they were both extremely concerned, my mother just 
told me it must’ve been a misunderstanding. It wasn’t. She told me how making my room messy was “a big fuck you to me”. Agian, I have adhd and have a lot of depressive episodes. I don’t talk to her about my depressive episodes because I don’t trust her but she knows I have adhd and how hard it is to motivate me. 

I left the room and told my dad about her being insane, I tried leaving the house but she forced me back in and started ranting to me about how she spent hours cleaning my room for me and how much of an ungrateful piece of shit I am or whatever. I just went outside.

After a whole thing of me waiting to leave for therapy for 2 hours, my dad telling me how my mum acts like this because she wants me to feel better. I went inside my dads office for a bit, my brother (10) saw me crying a hour earlier and asked what happened. I told him mum was being kind of an idiot and moved everything in my room without telling me. After a bit of talking I cut him off saying “dude. Once you turn 18, I’m getting you out of here.” 

Then I started getting ready to leave I went back inside the house and heard my mom full on crying. I kind of felt bad but this is the millionth time something like this has happened. She does stuff like this, I call her out for it, she cries about how she’s a terrible mother and then gives a shit apology mostly talking about how she is hurt or whatever. 

I finally got to therapy and talked to her about how I think I have cptsd and depression and talked about multiple traumatic incidents in my life. She told me that I have definitely experienced trauma, and that my family situation is bad, but it’s hard to really tell if you have cptsd at this point in my life. That’s what I expected, it’s just good to know what I’ll probably get when I move out. 

Went back to my grandparents for a few hours before going back home. I told my grandma I wanted to go to her house the next day, but my dad said I should talk to my mother to “clear the air”. As expected, she sent a lengthy nothing burger apology. If you know me, one of my biggest pet peeves is saying sorry to someone who absolutely doesn’t deserve it. But for some reason, I just replied with this. 

Okay then

I forgive you. 

I mean, I didn’t really forgive her. When I sent that, a thought popped in my brain going “that’s the biggest lie you’ve ever said in your life.” 

She comes into my room an hour later, acting like everything was normal again. I felt sick, fucking SICK to my stomach. I have this anxious habit of breathing frantically even though I can breathe normally when I’m extremely anxious and terrified. Once she left the room I was panting. I started searching through my diaries of every single time I’ve been through this with her, and a million incidents over the past 7 years came to my brain. I started panting and my eyes felt super watery. I realized how much this woman has done to me, and I realized that I didn’t want to have a relationship with her that was real. I wanted to just lie, and lie and lie and pretend everything was real until I could leave. But at the same time the truth was so horrifying I went to bed terrified and woke up wanting to fall asleep forever. 

I don’t care if she feels terrible anymore. She never said sorry. But at the same time, she’s done so many good things to me? I don’t even know who my mother is anymore, but all I can see her as is a monster right now. I feel like if I tell anyone they’re just gonna say that my mum just cares about me but is showing it in a weird way, I honestly wish she was just purely evil so I wouldn’t question anything."

It traumatized me so now, when I became friends with someone 22f I would have a really specific habit.

The habit is that after I hangout my brain thinks to a moment during the hangout that was negative and it becomes very problematic to me. Everything in my being says that it’s a really important problem. So literally whenever I have a hangout I do this. Then I bring it up with her and she needs to spend considerable time talking me out of my negative thought process.

For example I hung out twice with her. The first time was good. The second time, she was talking about how last time we hung out was magical.

When I got home I began becoming convinced that she was lovebombing me by saying that last night was magical. I brought it up and she said she only meant it was a good time.

I realized I do this so much because I love the drama. I love having an issue be brought forward and to be the one to realize that it’s a sign of a bad toxic relationship. The issue is I think this about her every time. Every single thing that seems bad repeats in my mind consistently. And the more I see her, the more intensely it happens.

Why can’t I learn my lesson about it and why am I so scared that I end up too naive to see the relationship will be a waste of time? I want to so badly avoid being around a bad person that I create the bad energy I fear."

You're telling me getting upset with someone from time to time *doesn't* mean that they hate you now and actually it's your fault for overreacting and it's no big deal and it doesn't matter? It doesn't make them mad at you until you figure out why your anger was wrong? Sometimes your anger is justified and sometimes the person you're angry at might even apologize and understand why you're upset and change their behavior or compromise with you? What the fuck?

This is our second time dating. The first time, I was still stuck in the mindset of ""it doesn't matter if I'm upset, all that matters is that he's happy."" I hid so many little grievances I had, thinking they were so minor they didn't matter. I pretended to be fine while I had to turn away to hide that I was crying. I thought, well, I know he doesn't mean to upset me, so it's my fault that I'm upset. And all of these little things snowballed into one big thing until I dumped it all on him and then dumped him too.

And now, after a year of working on myself and learning how to be upset a normal amount and handle it normally by going through rough times with friends, we're back together. And I've made a point to really emphasize that I'm trying harder to communicate my needs better and I force myself to air out grievances as soon as I can so they can't fester. And I'm... happy. I'm so fucking happy. How can anger and sadness make you happy? I don't get it. I'm confused. But it's happening. It's true.

I've always felt physically safe with him. I know he would never intentionally hurt me and he's very clear that the only way he would ever use his imposing figure with me is to protect me. But now I feel emotionally safe too. Safe to speak my mind, be happy, be upset, be annoyed, be excited. I can trust that no matter what emotion it is, he'll try to understand it and support me. He's the only one in my life I feel this unwaveringly safe with. It's cathartic. And I feel so goddamn happy."

Fight and flight. Never had it before. This year I tragically lost my brother, unearthed past emotional/physical/sexual trauma, and found myself in a complex relationship. 

What kicked it off each time was a strong sense of pullback from someone I have a loving and very secure relationship with, yet there’s just enough room for questioning or lack of definition. When it felt like a big pullback into territory where maybe I had been mislead previously, I flipped. 

I yelled, swore, was verbally aggressive. It’s clear it’s defense by offense as what I spout out are accusations my biggest fears along with what I know the other person would fear the most. It’s vile. That part of my psyche knows what it’s like to be abused and hurt and knows how to dish it out too. 

I don’t even remember it. I’m told about it later. I have a residual feeling of anger or confusion. Especially when I hear what happened. These are thoughts I’ve *never* had or said. Especially not to the person it’s said too. 

Without fail, each time is later met with me breaking down into a crying, moaning mess. I’m a grown man begging not to be hurt, crawling into the corner to hide. It feels so much like something bad is happening. Like someone is about to burst through the door or is touching me. I can’t crawl away from that sick feeling and I can’t hide from whatever bad is coming. The perceived slight that triggered me feel like being molested, or hit, or like someone is dying, or the pain of losing my brother. Some combo of the worst things that happened to me. 

I’m so disgusted with this. I could deal with the breakdown part. But my lashing out is sickening. I’m truly hurting people with these words and ruining what little love I’ve found. I am a peaceful, loving person. I strive to make others feel secure. Then there’s this fucking demon that comes out and does the opposite. 

It doesn’t even feel like I did this but I know I did. I’m responsible. But it feels like someone else came in, destroyed everything, then blamed me for it. I truly can’t even remember it, which is disturbing all on its own. 

I’m trying so hard to not hate myself for this. I am fighting to not sequester myself from love. And honestly, I’ve thought about killing myself so I don’t hurt anyone. I have no plans to do so and don’t want to but I’d rather die than hurt someone else like this. It’s my problem to bury, not theirs. 

I know where this comes from. I was abused as a child. As an adult I was also treated terribly by people who said they loved me. I’ve never had a love that lasts or doesn’t become abusive. My brain is broken when it comes to attachment. I search for signs of abandonment or manipulation. Then when someone flips an opinion they’re well within their right to flip, I see it as life or death. My brain defends me at all costs. Then it breaks down into a hurt child.

There was a lot of sexual coercion and manipulation. He was abusing several other young girls during the time that I thought we were in a relationship. I was 13-21 when this happened and now am 36. I didn’t realize it was abuse until many years later. Now looking back, he was a serious predator. R Kelly type of shit. I have considered reporting these events to child protective services but haven’t felt like the risks are worth it so far. Today, I found out that he is employed as an administrator at my son’s school. It really scares me that he could be around my kid and that I might have to deal with interacting with him. I am considering making a report of my abuse because he is still working with children and is in a position of power where he could prey on the vulnerable ones. I’m also a mandated reporter of child abuse in my state. Does anyone have experience with this and is it worth making a report this many years later?"

I'm not in any doubt about having cptsd but I'm just not sure what I have to gain from going to the doctor about it. The process of getting the diagnosis is quite off-putting as well. I'm struggling at the moment and the idea of having to go in to details and talk about symptoms etc doesn't feel good.

Maybe because I'm struggling that's the exact reason I should be getting medical help? Who knows. Although I'm not sure what treatment is available

Has anyone got any experience of this, good or bad? Was a diagnosis helpful?

I'm UK based if that makes any difference.

The timing couldn't have been worse; I was at college living with roommates in dorms and apartments for the first time. I was staying the night with hook-ups and crashing at my brand new friends' places. All these new people got to witness my trauma.

  
One roommate despised me and chewed me out constantly for eating her food. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about and I truly meant it. Then one day she woke me up, standing over me in bed, angrily accusing me of having eaten the leftover Chicken Tikki Marsala she'd been looking forward to having. I denied eating it and told her off for accusing me, only for her to scream ""IT'S ALL OVER YOUR FACE"".

...Turns out it was, I had eaten it. I had been sleepwalking into the kitchen every night to rummage through the fridge. I had to start tying my leg to my bed to prevent myself from doing it (barely worked, I'd untie it in my sleep).

  
I woke up to people violently shaking me and yelling that I was having a nightmare more times than I can count. I'd be so startled, confused and annoyed, I'd have no memory of the dreams and had no clue why they were bothering me, but was told I'd shriek and sob things like ""HELP, NO, STOP, PLEASE, NO, I'M SORRY, DON'T"" while flailing in bed.

  
A few times I woke up to someone flipping on a light and staring at me in bewildered disgust, just to suddenly realize I'd apparently been standing in the dark bathroom in the middle of the night like a total creep for god knows how long.

  
The worst incident was when I'd crashed at an acquaintance's place. I'd been heavily drinking, hadn't slept in 48hrs and was messily crying, so he invited me to sleep it off in his bed while he sat at his PC and talked to friends over voicechat.

  
I vaguely remember a dream about threatening figures surrounding and taunting me, then me beckoning them closer like ""You wanna hurt me? I dare you, see what happens"" and then attacking them. I suddenly woke up in the hallway of this guy's building with him screaming at me to calm down while I, panicked, babbled about someone dangerous in his apartment, insisting we had to get out of there. He angrily showed me there was no one in his place. I was so confused, I couldn't figure out what was going on. He practically dragged me back to my place, pushed me towards my roommates and bolted.

  
A week later, I learned what had happened. I'd abruptly sat up in his bed, smiling eerily, and beckoned him to come closer. When he leaned in to humor me, I...just launched myself at him. His friends heard it all over voicechat, they described me screaming ""like a demon"". I'd managed to bite all the way through his leather jacket and broke the skin, then fled his apartment into the hallway, where he caught up and shook me awake.

  
All of my new friends at college suddenly thought I was a dangerous psycho and I was banned from entering people's homes. Everyone gossiped about the incident and shunned me, it was humiliating. I understand their fear, but at the same time, it was devastating to end up socially isolated at such a vulnerable point in time. It fed into my self-loathing, like ""Why am I such a crazy fucking freak, why am I like this??""

  
I'm much, much better these days, but last night I woke up standing in front of my microwave at 3am while it made HORRIBLE noises because I'd apparently tried to cook a metal cocoa tin in it for 10mins. Just when you think you're past it, something pops up.

I also briefly discuss self harm. I did not go into too much detail but just a heads up. 

I am 20F and I do not know if this is normal. I went through cancer from ages 17-20. I have had other traumatic things happen before though. I was emotionally abused by my father. I do not know if what he did should be considered emotional abuse, but Idk how else to put it. It started when I was 10-11. He would get irritated whenever I would disagree with him. However, when I was 13, he began to get violent. He killed my pet with a shot gun and I had to watch. He said I was a horrible daughter and that the pet had to die because I was a bad person. He would grab me, drag me down the stairs, and shook me around at a park. I am from a middle class family and he would always buy things for me, and then threaten to take them away whenever I did something wrong. For example, he bought me a car. However, I was talking to my mom one day and he came in and started shouting at me. He called me names and was yelling so I started to grab the car keys. He took them from me and said that since he paid for the car, I could not use it unless I apologize. He made me give up other items as well, such as my phone. I ended up apologizing. I used self harm as a coping mechanism, and when he saw my scars, he said they weren't deep enough to be concerning. He never took my side and was always pitting me against my peers. He commented a lot on my weight and looks to the point where I developed an eating disorder. But this is all besides the point. I was diagnosed with cancer when I graduated high school. 

Cancer was very hard for me. I felt like the worst case scenario always ended up happening. I was dating a guy at the time. A family friend. He became my main line of support as my friends were withdrawn and my family was so emotionally draining that I could not open up to them. My mom got mad that I was crying, and my dad would say how much of a loser I was because I was not doing well in my classes. I continued working, school, and dealing with life. My boyfriend broke up with me because it was too much, however, he would still text me. I wanted him to stop, but if I made him stop, I would not have anyone. Plus, I was always put down whenever I set boundaries and, combined with my introverted nature, I truly struggle setting boundaries. Sometimes he would unleash his frustrations on me, and I sorta just took it. We eventually stopped communicating. I also would visit certain places while going through cancer and would eat only a limited amount of stuff. It was a very dark time. I actually struggle articulating how truly mentally tormenting that was. Abandoned, but yet not abandoned, while going through cancer. 

My struggle is, that now that it is mostly over, certain things will send me back to that poor 19 year old who was dumped and abused while going through cancer. Unfortunaly, my ex is a family friend, so I have to see him a lot.  Whenever I do see him, it is not an awkward encounter at all, rather, it sends me back to when I was helpless and how he treated me. So its not so much awkward, rather emotionally stressful. Holidays make me sad, because I was attempting to end my life New Year's 2023.  Whenever I see my family (which is a lot because I live with them) it brings back a lot of pain. I will be making a lot of progress and then I go to certain place, am served a certain thing, or see a certain person and will get sent back to that same mindset, with the same feelings, and same impending feeling of doom. I don't know what to do, I cannot afford treatment for this ""trauma"" and it is really affecting my quality of life. I feel like I am constantly ""on guard"" and looking over my should everywhere I go. Almost like I am expecting something bad to happen. I posted my story on r/stories and was referred here so I am here. I had to go see my ex again today, and I have to schedule a scan to make sure I am still cancer free and I am slipping back to 2022/2023 and I am sorta sad rn. "

1) primarily used CBT and helped me uncover my childhood trauma but victim blamed me in our last session which sent me into a month-long emotional flashback
2) primarily used EMDR but just wasn’t compassionate or validating, and provided no guidance during sessions. I never walked out of a session feeling better.

Both seemed like good fits before I started actually working with him. No red flags until some sessions in.

I’ve interviewed dozens of therapists and I can’t seem to find any “good enough” ones for trauma work. I feel as if I ask all the right questions, but I really don’t know until you get a few sessions into it.

CPTSD,Communicating & healing from abuse,18x8560,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18x8560/communicating_healing_from_abuse/,https://www.reddit.com/user/efftheestablishment,efftheestablishment,2024-01-03 02:37:07,Communicating & healing from abuse,"Tw: self harm mention (brief) & discussion/reflection on emotional abuse

I'm in a new relationship - my boyfriend is really, really sweet. I've given him the rundown on my past with my mental health, and he took it all very well. I've been solid in recovery from self harm (among other things) for a while now, but it still does have an impact on me from time to time, and it's also been a big part of my life that I wanted him to know.

Today he sent me this clip to watch, and there was a self harm joke in the middle. It wasn't the central focus, and it wasn't offensive, either, but it certainly caught me off guard. Being home for the holidays has made me struggle a bit more with my recovery, and again, although it wasn't offensive, it also probably wasn't something I needed to see.

I first sat with it and thought about whether I should say something. I really believe communication is important in a relationship, and from past experiences, I've started to solidify this idea that not communicating cheats both of us out of what we want.

I was shaking, crying a bit, but I did it. I swallowed my initial thoughts and fears and let him know how I felt.

And he reacted so well. He apologized, and - I think what helps the most - is that he was able to do so without centering the conversation on *his* guilt. Because yeah, I'm sure he feels a little guilty about it, but whether its a result of the abuse, or the behavior itself is abusive, I have put so much energy & fear into this idea that my emotions matter less than others, and that I shouldn't put people in a situation where they're going to feel guilty.

He also solidly told me he appreciates how communicative I am - not just in a ""thanks for telling me"" type of way, but in a genuine ""i am glad you trust me to tell me these things and i want to know these things."" The way he phrased it to me just really emphasized how he actually cared to hear it. It's really affirming for me, and honestly I cried, again, but this time in a positive way, like ""wow I love him so much and i really appreciate him"" 

Abuse has made communicating my feelings so hard, and it's nice to be able to find someone who *wants* to hear about how I feel, who *cares* about how I feel, and *encourages* me to do so, without making me feel like I have hurt them by bringing it up. It's really... nice. I can't describe it. I just wanted to let this out."

I don’t see a future for myself.  I was working as a nanny for 6 years and then couldn’t find work so I’ve been unemployed since September and on EI.  I have one interview this Thursday but that’s it…after applying to so many jobs.  I don’t think I even want to nanny anymore.  I’m 52 and I just feel I’ve outgrown it.  It’s not stable work and I have not been able to save.  The last 2 years have been flashback hell—tons of excruciating emotional pain.  I have been underemployed and unemployed at times.  I have been just barely getting by and racking up debt on my credit card.

  I’ve done a lot of healing work and think I’ve finally have gotten to a better place— I still struggle with  flashbacks all the time but they seem to be getting less intense.  I’ve been at home completely alone for the last 4 months.  Mostly self-care.

What I really want to do is be self-employed and work from home.  I have the beginnings of a life coaching business but I don’t have the time to build it.  I’ve been doing a little here and there in the last few weeks since I started feeling a little better.  I think my EI will run out within the next 5 or 6 months and by then I would be totally broke.  No savings and credit card to the max.

Nannying really holds no hope for my future and I don’t see how I could get a thriving business going in the next few months.  

I’m just so frigging infuriated right now!!!!!!  Have I done all this healing work for nothing?  Is this where everything goes to shit?  I kept hoping for a miracle or something but there isn’t one.

It’s something I haven’t been able to pinpoint and the furthest I’ve gotten is realizing I dissociated EVERY SINGLE TIME an emotion needs to be felt. The biggest struggle is when people tell me bad things. Whenever someone tells me some negative news for example “hey my dog just died and I’m super sad” it’s like a shockwave goes through my body and all the sudden I just dissociated and genuinely can’t find anything to feel it’s just nothingness. It happens In seconds too like literally instantaneous between the time they finish the sentence and the time I’m expected to respond. It’s really frustrating and honestly I feel like the only time I feel emotions is when I’m alone. Can barely cry in front of others or share an emotional experience but on the regular I just cry when I’m alone and it happens at the most inconvenient times like for example I literally just like cried on the way home from class a few weeks ago got done by the time I got to my parking lot and just moved on with my day. The emotional numbing also causes significant stress on my life because people get mad at me for being unemotional and it makes me feel like something is wrong with me

Recently I had to get a letter written by him for my college's ESA approval, and they wrote in the letter that one of the things I needed it for was PTSD. I was like ""???"" and asked why they put PTSD on it and they said they just put it down for the trauma from my pet dying from a medical incident in the previous year. And I was like ""uh okay dude"". Like I barely mentioned this at all and this is the first time I'm hearing I have PTSD from it but okay dude. And then he ended our 15 minute meeting and let me go. Tbh I should change psychologists but I have no clue how to handle that... my parents basically take over half my life.

What struck me though was that the whole time during the conversation I wasn't thinking about my pet, I was thinking about how I literally haven't told the psychologist about my family at all and how could they possibly know anything about that. And then I was like why am I even thinking about my family in the first place lol. I mean they suck but they don't suck THAT much. And I don't even have any signs of PTSD as far as I know. I'm pretty sure. Well long story short I did a bunch of internet rabbit hole google searching and then I came here and started crying without even realizing it after reading all the posts. And now my therapist has basically confirmed in our past couple of meetings that I've definitely been emotionally and physically abused. Like... severely.

So I guess thanks to this subreddit and thanks to my psychologist who sucks lol. But seriously I'm grateful that this community exists, I was taught that PTSD was a thing that only happened to people with ""extreme"" childhoods and that my childhood wasn't that ""extreme"" because I grew up in the most Sunday church clothes suburbs ever. But now I'm realizing that half of the things that make up my identity and all my ""quirks"" that I felt like just came out of nowhere actually have a reason now. Like I have a reason for why I feel so detached from people, and why I constantly beat myself up for every little mistake, and why I get what I didn't realize were panic attacks when I think people are getting frustrated with me and shit.

He made me feel more seen, heard, and valued than any other human I have ever known…until he didn’t. He told me several massive lies about his life and would gaslight me. When I finally confronted him he responded by discarding me and going on a smear campaign.
If you’re like me you’re guarded with new people. But once they’re in will stay in relationship to your detriment trying to prove worth. 
There has been something so insidious about being coaxed into handing over your wounds to someone who promises they are going to help clean up those wounds only to then use your pain to wipe their feet with. It has reinforced every abusive word I ever heard.

Then, after my longest shopping experience with no anxiety/meltdowns, I completely shut down when she jokingly locked me out of her car. Suddenly I had an overwhelming feeling of rejection, which turned to genuine fear she was going to ditch me, then anger that she'd ""betray"" me like this. 

Mentally, I was experiencing a horrible tantrum, but physically I had just shut down. I walked away from the car and I got a good distance away before she was able to reach me and made me get back in the car. I snapped out of that shut down state when she was telling me how scared she was for my safety and that she was sorry. I apologized as well that same car ride, but it still bugs me the fact I did that.

I wouldn't care if I was having mental meltdowns alone, but the fact my girlfriend, and I guess the public now, are witnesses to that is so embarrassing and I feel guilty."

He then pushed the top of my head down which required some force as I wasn’t understanding what he wanted and didn’t want to do this. He then said “give me head”. And then I did give him oral sex. He then said “thanks” and walked off and Left me there. I then had to walk to a friends house which was quite far away, in the dark. I was so drunk that I kept falling to my knees every few steps, and my knees were scraped up. This event has affected my self-worth and self-esteem so much. I feel sick and shakey when I recall it. He contacted me via Facebook messenger to apologise for his actions. I am deeply humiliated by it all, and so so angry. BUT I don’t know whether this could be considered sexual assault as I didn’t fight back in any way, although I knew and know that I had absolutely no desire or want to do that sexual act, and I felt totally degraded (which I am sure was what he wanted). It’s this factor that holds me back from seeking support. That people would think well, you didn’t say no. I could have walked away. He was also my sisters ex boyfriend. Is this a sexual assault? I have had a ‘fawn’ response to many many serious situations since then. I want to be a fighter not freeze but it doesn’t come naturally."

Which I understood so now I only meet her when I have therapy with other people and have a new therapist that I meet weekly.

I notice I struggle a lot with this change and I feel like I was feeling a lot better when I did my work with her and don’t really feel like this new therapist is really doing it for me. 

I tried to bring it up in a group talk but I was too afraid to stand up for myself. She mentioned it’s better and probably also more helpful for me long term but I’m kinda doubtful since I don’t really have that many systemic therapy sessions and probably won’t have unless my partner and I would do more. I don’t really see my family participating in these sessions long term. 


Idk if I should give the new therapist a longer chance or bring up this issue again and perhaps find a different solution for the systemic part.


Any advice is welcome"

CPTSD,"This awful way that I never learned to make anything simply easier for myself, or extend any patience, understanding, kindness. Everything had to be so callous, and terrifying, when it didn't' need to be that way.",18x65gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18x65gj/this_awful_way_that_i_never_learned_to_make/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Goodtogo_5656,Goodtogo_5656,2024-01-03 01:05:51,"This awful way that I never learned to make anything simply easier for myself, or extend any patience, understanding, kindness. Everything had to be so callous, and terrifying, when it didn't' need to be that way.","I was watching a video my partner showed me of a family getting a bath ready for their beagle puppy.  This was adorable, my partner is so awesome.   Here's this colorful, cute tiny little blowup pool, this adorable beagle puppy, maybe 8 weeks-12 weeks old.  They start throwing in these toys, my heart is melting.  First a rubber duck, then a little colorful ball, a tiny little ship, ....then some treats....you get the idea.   It's all fun and cute, and a small 4 year old girl is standing by , helping, in her pink tutu.  They gently lift the puppy in the pool, he's eating the treats, he's having his little head scritched with soap, and it's this great thing.

Then I was thinking about how nothing was done to help me alleviate my fears, nothing.  Just ""stop being afraid...nothing to be afraid about"".   I do this to myself\*-Now\*!?   It's like throwing someone in a pool that doesn't' know how to swim, and shouting ""okay, SWIM!""

I was afraid of everything growing up, which I think is pretty natural.  But probably more afraid,  having come from what I came from, so much danger, etc.   So fear would have been pretty normal.  But zero help with that.  Just shoving you into situations , before  you're ready.

I really need to remember this the next time I'm chastising myself for being a baby, and saying ""just get over it"".

And remembering so many things like this.  Watching that video was , idk, shocking?  Like there's a world like this, where people help other beings, people, with their fear.   I think I'm still stunned that this is a thing?

I was afraid of the dark when I was small.   No  help, just ""go to sleep"", close the door.  No nightlight, not even think to leave the door ajar, and put the hallway light on,...nothing.   Now I have nightlights that change color , in almost every room of the house, out of spite, and because I like them.

but what really worries me , is sometimes I can't think of a way to make something easier, not only for myself, but for  others.  I""m not trying to be callous, I tend to just default to ""Oh, you'll be okay"".   I hate that, I don't want to be like that.  I want to be the person who's getting the toys, making little post it stickers-with sparkle pens,  sending loving supportive colorful animated texts, sending fun cards, tying balloons and shit to stuff to help people remember things.   I got none of that growing up.   It never occurs to me, to make things easier, not for myself, and not for others.   It's all just ""just do it, stop being a baby, "".

But I don't' think that's just me?  I've been seeing this dentist, and told him I have anxiety, he's not callous, just sort of indifferent-which come to think of it, is callous=indifference?   I told him I was nervous, and he was like  ""Oh, okay, well you'll be okay"".   My thought is, ""thats it?""  So I guess it's okay that he's a top notch dentist, and not my therapist. So I might bring a weighted blanket and maybe put a stuffy in my purse.   What's that saying about not expecting the entire world to be carpeted , so wear slippers??.   :)

But tbh, this really breaks my heart, it made me so sad to see that video.   This little puppy is getting more emotional care for his tender feelings than I got.   I was sort of dragged, and pushed and shamed into doing stuff.    ""Oh, you're afraid?   that's nothing, forget it"".     I have this distinct memory of my mother holding my hand, when I was 4, and feeling nothing from her.  No warmth, tenderness, nothing.    Like I might as well have been a rag doll, and I felt like one.  Jasmin Lee Cori talks about this in her book ""The Emotionally Absent Mother"".  About feeling no warmth from someone, the quote ""they look like the Sun, but cold, no warmth"".   

I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting  to make things easier, and more accommodating for yourself, for your trauma, for how you struggle with everything.   Never mind, oh, ""I shouldn't be struggling with this much"".   Screw the judgement, start putting up balloons and sparkly glow shit to deal with the pervasive struggle with .....everything.  If not that, made to order accommodations for your pain and fear.....obviously for  your CPTSD.

The crazy thing is that had I just had carefully attentive parents, to provide a fraction of accommodations, and sensitivity for my emotions, I wouldn't now need;  therapy, weighted blankets, fucking mantras,  pre-emptive scripts and narratives for every contingency, because I have no internal coping mechanism layered with years of rubber ducks, night lights, soft spoken conversations, creative and funny narratives to help me manage the unknown.  All I have is the terror, and the memory of being shoved into situations before I was ready....with zero understanding.

It took me years to figure out that I needed to get up 2 and half hours before I had to be at work, just to prepare my nervous system.   Before that I gave myself 20 minutes, while I sped down the road, hair wet, frantic, ....I had no clue.   This is how I grew up.   No preparation, nothing, ""we're doing this, be ready"" or ""we're leaving NOW"".  Never tell you the day before, never help you figure out how to prepare, no conversation, I swear it was intentional just to watch you freak out.

When I contemplate  what I  need to heal my  wounds;    all the patience I can fathom, all the understanding I can muster, all the kindness I can envision. ......then I should triple it."

i am 17 & i live with my abusive mum and my two brothers. my mum has always treated me differently from my brothers r, especially the oldest one. she has been emotionally abusive and mentally abusive towards me, and also physically abusive and i generally just feel extremely unsafe at home, very unhappy and right now as i’m typing this i’m getting increasingly anxious as i’m essentially recalling all the harmful things she does to me. i am struggling a lot right now & have been since i’ve been on christmas break. i always struggle during the holidays /breaks because i’m at home for longer than i want to be. i quite frankly hate living here. when i’m at school i have my friends and i also have weekly therapy which i recently started. i have been trying to leave the house more often this break because i know it’ll be good for me, but when i’m back home it just weighs on my heart that this is my life. i dread every interaction with her even the minor ‘hello’ and ‘how was your day’ at the end of last month she did this family discussion thing she’s been doing for a while, where she calls everyone to essentially say how she was unhappy with us this year, how she’s struggling & feels like nobody cares about her and how next year will be *much much better*! she made the assertion that the issue is that we as a family don’t communicate enough, as this discussion happens yearly and she often tells me i’m not good enough (which she did this year again) and that i need to change next year or else (which younger me made a dedication to doing, because i thought i was the reason she treated me so horribly), i was really happy to hear it because i thought she would finally recognise her abusive behaviour and apologise to me for it, and this would actually be a change in my life and our relationship. she didn’t acknowledge her behaviours which made it difficult to communicate, she didn’t acknowledge that years and years of abuse made it so i didn’t wanna be in the same room with her for longer than two minutes. 
i think that is one of the things i am struggling with the most right now. the guilt and like shame of feeling like a bad daughter because i don’t have a good relationship with her.
i did not choose this for myself and i can understand that but i do not feel it.
basically idk i guess i wanna vent. i am feeling the brunt of not being with the support of my counsellor and i feel uncomfortable talking to my friends about the abuse suse sometimes. i would really love some advice or help from brooke who have experienced this and who are idk in a better place. or just words of kindness. the self help and affirmations aren’t rlly sticking w me rn.

When I was younger if I was put down by my dad and to be clear he was pretty harsh and abusive at times.
I would internalize my feelings and become passive-aggressive and see myself as inadequate or broken. 
Imagine scenarios where I'd run away essentially it was almost as if I would imagine scenarios where I was putting myself into dangerous situations like I would think about wanting to drink and run away and become dysfunctional to get back at them if that makes sense. 
It was never like direct self harm I didn't want to die or anything like that it was more so like if they seen me in distress maybe then they would care because I'm never enough.


I'm an adult now but what I've discovered is those reactions have not left even when the people in my life have changed. 
I now have this tendency to overanalyze or suddenly just become super reactive to something my partner will say for example and it's the same exact reaction I start thinking that I need to be mad at myself or like I need to punish myself or alienate myself from others and just soak in the anger essentially it's as if they can see me and how fragile and broken I am then maybe they will actually feel sorry for me. 
I have gotten a little better with this but I noticed that this reactive like experience manifests itself randomly.
I just get really reactive and I suddenly have this whole experience like what I described above does anybody relate with this or understand it?"

Maybe some of you can relate to this deep inequality and unfairness of life when being a victim of abuse.

He was my step-dad. Abuse was consistent over many years and came in all shapes and sizes. He was a real life monster.

Every once in a while I look him up to try and find an obituary. No luck. I got too curious and tried to see how his psychopathic family was doing. They are good looking people with a lot of money (except my abuser, he’s an ugly pig). He has a new wife, with two young daughters. I tried to warn her via messaging many years ago of what he did to me, she never responded/didn’t seem to care.

They’re going on all of these extravagant trips, eating out all of the time, own a beautiful home, her daughter gets to go to university. His mother died and left behind a huge inheritance, leaving him even richer. I never went to university because my mom had to leave my abuser, we had no money. My abuser has so many friends who have no idea of the truth.

My family is dirt poor. Never get to travel outside the country. Can’t afford to eat out. No friends at all. Deep loneliness. I’m probably going to rent for life. Still struggling deeply with the after affects of his abuse, even a decade and a half later.

Life is a cruel joke. He should be the one suffering. Instead he and his fucked up family are living lavishly as if nothing ever happened. And my family is left to suffer. I just went ahead and finally blocked them all so I don’t make the mistake of looking them up again. I will remember this and carry it with me though. I will use it to fuel my progress and make sure if they ever somehow come across me again, they will be shocked at how far I came despite their attempts to destroy my life.

I can’t wait for the day when I do eventually see his obituary."

CPTSD,Traumatic memory and feeling valid,18x2gop,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18x2gop/traumatic_memory_and_feeling_valid/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Practicalavoidance,Practicalavoidance,2024-01-02 22:30:09,Traumatic memory and feeling valid,"Recently I came across a section in a book about dissociation and relational trauma, written in Norwegian, where they discussed traumatic memory. As someone who doesn't remember the CSA that I factually know happened to me, I struggle a lot with feeling whether my trauma responses are valid. I was interviewed by social services about this as a child and all I did was shake my head. If something really happened, why didn't I speak up when I was given the chance? When my older sister blatantly did?

Well, as I came across this segment it almost made sense. The authors referred to a Swedish study from the 1990s, where they interviewed children who had been abused for child pornography. The children didn't remember the abuse happening. Even when shown photographic evidence of themselves being abused, they denied it ever happened and said they didn't remember. Only after repeated exposure and opportunity to speak did they start to open up about it.

And that made me think... maybe I never remembered it happening. Maybe I suppressed it immediately. Maybe it only happened once or a few times and I could just tuck it away. Even if it happened more often over more time, maybe I denied that part of my reality so completely it wasn't real. Even now I have no memory of it, not beyond vague sensations in particular circumstances.

Anyway. I just wanted to share, in case someone else out there struggles with memory and feeling valid. There's research that indicates we're not wrong and we're not liars.

I just want to know if anyone else has had any similar experiences and what they did to encourage the healing process.

I'd love to have kids, to be able to love them and raise someone to live a happy life. But I'm scared I'll fuck it up somehow.

All my life I've been mentally neglected. Isolated from outside contact for 6 years now. Been depressed for as long as I can remember, my oldest memory being a suicide attempt when I was 7. I was beaten and bruised and my blood was shed a decent amount.

I don't think my family knew how much this would fuck me up. I don't think they know now even. They were raised beaten and neglected too (albeit not hidden away from the outside world for years but still).

I want to love someone, I want to feel loved dammit. But I'd rather die than hurt anyone for my own pleasure.

Every single time I try to do this it absolutely does NOT make me feel better, it renders me completely useless: late to work or calling in, not being able to drive because I’m hysterical while I “feel my feelings”, physically throwing up and/or diarrhea, hyperventilating, and then almost always ends with extreme feelings of suicide. Logically the practice makes sense, but even the simplest moments of discomfort destroy me if I try to sit with it and feel it.   
   
   For example, today it was my fiancés tone changing and then acting distant right before he went to work that made me uncomfortable, clearly not a big deal and could certainly be unrelated to me. Either way it made me feel panicked and shitty so I decided to sit with it so I would feel better. It made everything so much worse and I’ve spiraled to a point of wanting to self harm. If I had just ignored it, I’d be at work functioning like a real normal adult.   
   
   WHATS THE POINT OF THIS? It’s like every fiber in my being is focused and concentrated on healing and taking care of myself… yet I’m only getting worse and less convinced there’s any reason to be alive. What’s the point of healing if it leads you to suicide? I’ve never felt so hopeless in my life, literally what is the point of healing if you end up dying

A ‘friend’ of mines mother has passed away. She was a lovely woman, she gave me a purse for my birthday years ago that I still use now. They are a wonderful family, and we were all very close at one point. They made me feel loved and included always. 

However, in recent years I have distanced myself from everyone,(to prevent further trauma so I can heal the wounds I already have) and literally only speak to them when I bump into them which is rarely simply because I don’t go anywhere except home and work and to buy food. 

I saw several posts on social media of her passing and didn’t say anything, she messaged me directly to let me know she passed and I gave my condolences, and thought that was that. She’s just invited me to the funeral and desperately don’t want to go. 

Displays of emotion make me entirely uncomfortable, I won’t know anyone there (it will mainly be their family and friends from Sri Lanka) also I don’t know culturally what will be expected of me and don’t want to offend anyone on such an already sad day. 

Am I being a complete bitch? Should I feel honoured to be invited? I’ve never been to a funeral of a non-relative before and the last family member of mine to pass was 12 years ago. So I don’t even know if it’s common practice to invite non relatives. I feel bad that I’m being a selfish prick 😭

Book Review.","A week or so ago, I posted a book review on here for Gabor Mate's 'When The Body Says No'. A few people suggested I post further reviews for relevant texts so here's my take on Bessel Van Der Kolks' 'The Body Keeps the Score'.

&#x200B;

**What is the book about?**  
  
In this excellent volume, BVDK gives an overview of the knowledge about the effects of psychological trauma, abuse, and neglect based on three emerging disciplines:

  
•	Neuroscience: the study of how the brain supports mental processes.  
•	Developmental psychopathology: the study of the impact of adverse experiences on the development of mind and brain.   
•	Interpersonal neurobiology: the study of how our behaviour influences the emotions, biology, and mind-sets of those around us.  
  


**What are the books’ key messages?**

Trauma is not just the event(s) that took place sometime in the past. It is also the imprint left on mind, brain, and body. This imprint has on-going consequences for how the human organism manages to survive in the present. Trauma results in a fundamental reorganisation of the way mind and brain manage perceptions. It changes not only how we think and what we think about, but also our very capacity to think. What has happened – the events themselves – cannot be undone. This leaves us with a series of challenges:

  
•	Finding a way to become calm and focused.   
•	Learning to maintain that calm in response to images, thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations that remind you of the past.  
•	Finding a way to be fully alive in the present and engaged with the people around you.  
•	Not having to keep secrets from yourself, including secrets about the ways that you have managed to survive.   
These goals are not steps to be achieved, one by one, in some fixed sequence. They overlap, and some may be more difficult than others, depending on individual circumstances.   
  
  
Narrowing down to developmental trauma, BVDK provides a good summary of the original 1990’s ACE study. In the years since TBKTS’ publication in 2014 this has been widely disseminated. The section concludes with a valuable re-frame: the idea of the problem being a solution, while understandably disturbing to many, is certainly in keeping with the fact that opposing forces routinely coexist in biological systems… What one sees, the presenting problem, is often only the marker for the real problem, which lies buried in time, concealed by patient shame, secrecy and sometimes amnesia – and, frequently clinician discomfort.  
  


Following a refreshing discussion of the DSM’s weaknesses is a summary of BVDKs’ as-yet unsuccessful, attempts to establish developmental trauma as its own recognised diagnosis. Readers are led to recognise that two hurdles need to conquered: (1) PTSD, C-PTSD, and developmental trauma each need to be recognised as their own diagnoses and (2) the blinkered brain disease model summarised below needs to be replaced with multi-modal helping approaches blending BVDKs’ three avenues (as below) to best suit the individuals’ needs.  
  


The brain’s own natural neuroplasticity can be developed to help survivors feel fully alive in the present and move on with their lives. There are fundamentally three avenues to follow:

  
•	Top down, by talking, (re-)connecting with others, and allowing ourselves to know and understand what is going on with us, while processing the memories of the trauma.   
•	By taking medicines that shut down inappropriate alarm reactions, or by utilizing other technologies that change the way the brain organises information.   
•	Bottom up: by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that result from trauma.   
  


What BVDK referred to as the the brain-disease model ignores four fundamental truths – we ignore them at our peril:

  
•	Our evolutionary legacy provides us with a set of capabilities – and constraints. The more we – or others - push those boundaries, the more likely we are to suffer. This is central to restoring and sustaining our well-being.  
•	Our intelligence gives us the potential to develop ourselves, others, our environments, and our responses.  
•	We have the capability to regulate aspects of our own physiology, including some of the so-called involuntary functions of the body and brain, through such basic activities as breathing, moving, and touching.  
•	 We can, collectively, change social conditions to create environments aligned with our evolutionary needs and expectations within which we can feel safe and where we can thrive.

   
When we ignore these basic truths of our humanity, we deprive ourselves of ways to both prevent maladies in the first place and to heal when they do occur. We may subordinate our agency and render ourselves patients of the healthcare system, rather than exercise our agency to drive our healing process. Connecting with – rather than disconnecting from – what makes us incredible.   


Seeing issues with our mental health as internal processes, grants us much-needed agency – that feeling of being in control of our lives: being able to make the decisions that will lead us to our chosen future. If we consider the causes of mental health issues as external factors, something that happens to or around us – or as a biochemical anomaly - then it becomes a piece of history we can never dislodge. If, on the other hand, mental health issues are what take place inside us, resultant of what happened, then healing becomes a credible possibility. Trying to keep mental health issues at bay – or subcontracting them out to the medics (the doctor is responsible for resolving that issue while I get on with my life) hobbles our capacity to know ourselves better – to develop our agency.  
  
  
**What are its weak-spots?**

  
Due to its very nature, the content runs the risk of triggering some readers: it’s difficult to see an easy solution to this.

  
TBKTS delivers on its intentions to disseminate knowledge about the effects of psychological trauma, abuse, and neglect based on the three emerging disciplines of neuroscience, developmental psychopathology, and interpersonal neurobiology. It was not intended as a self-help ‘how to heal yourself’ which may leave some readers looking for more.   
  
While not a weakness, TBKTS was published around ten years ago. Given the pace of research, I wonder if there is scope or plans for a revised edition.   
  


**How does this relate to my own area Solution Focused Hypnotherapy?** 

  
BVDK refers to one of the key underpinning theories of SFH – the triune (three phase) theory of human brain evolution. With that theory understood, we introduce two further key concepts: (1) the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between evolutionary phases and (2) developing the capability to manage that dynamic equilibrium to our advantage. Academically, these two concepts are supported by the generally accepted Broaden & Build theory (Frederickson.)

  
Trauma – among other things - can shift the dynamic equilibrium to limit our options and plunge us in to vicious cycles of anger, and or anxiety and or depression (which can manifest in a myriad of ways.) Additionally, developmental trauma can lead to neurobiological effects in the hippocampus, amygdala, and pre-frontal cortex.

  
Without downplaying the seriousness of this, there are counter-balancing positive factors. To varying degrees, we each have four capabilities: Self-Awareness (interoception), Imagination, Conscience and Free-will, as articulated by Viktor Frankl. These sit at the root of us developing our sense of agency. The same process of neuroplasticity that shaped our developing neurology as children can support us in developing our adulthoods. Through the work of BVDK and many others, we have an emerging understanding of the lifelong effects of developmental trauma, and an ever-growing understanding of how these can be mitigated.

  
Solution Focused Hypnotherapy can be highly effective in helping those at threshold (motivated, and responsible for their outcomes) with anger, anxiety, and depression. Adding the body of knowledge supporting the PERMA model creates a solid platform for developing and sustaining wellbeing for those in the acceptance and action areas of the awareness / acceptance / action spectrum. Those in the earlier – awareness, acceptance – areas would benefit more from the traditional analytical / counselling approaches to helping.  
    


**Who would benefit from reading this book?**  


With the caveat that some readers may find elements of the content triggering, this is an ideal read for those who have ever wondered if events of their childhood are negatively affecting their present. 

  
For those experiencing developmental trauma, and those living with and supporting those who are – this is one of the must reads.

I know everyone will judge me and keep judging me. The funniest thing is that I really want to be responsible, functioning adult and not a scary, lazy, bum with nothing to do.

CPTSD,You are a diamond in disguise!,18wy4s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18wy4s4/you_are_a_diamond_in_disguise/,https://www.reddit.com/user/si_vis_amari__ama,si_vis_amari__ama,2024-01-02 19:38:38,You are a diamond in disguise!,"I would state several trigger warnings to begin with; CSA, SA, intimate partner abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and suicide ideation ; these are all flags that have applied to me at some part in my life's chronology. But this is not a post in which I want to relay the details of what caused me to qualify for a CPTSD diagnosis. Rather, I want to share how I got on top of it. 

In 2017 I had a mental breakdown after I left my ex-partner, who was the cause of so much suffering. I always thought of myself as ordinary like a rock. I felt like this breakdown split me apart and open; what I saw in that darkness was something that glittered. I began to view myself as only encapsulated by a layer of rock, but a rough diamond inside. I played small to survive; not because I am. My mission from henceworth was to keep chipping at layers of density, keep chiseling and carving this diamond, until I shine. Radical self-acceptance was my goal.

After having been born into homelessness and deep poverty, I have been able to work myself up. Often out of sheer rebellion against ideas that ""the apple does not fall far from the tree"", or ""a penny can never be a dollar"" (a saying in my homecountry). I sacrificed so much of my freetime and happiness to be able to start my working life with a strong CV. While my teachers as a teenager thought I would do some shitty job, I most definitely got more accolades than them now.

My CPTSD has often been a roadblock on the way. I've been heavily dissociative and self-sabotaging in making poor decisions and feeling too distraught, but I also managed to navigate those setbacks in such a way that I could draw my silver-linings from it and turn a bad situation into a positive situation. I realized at some point for example that my workaholicism was only a self-esteem-by-proxy; without good grades and compliments from my boss I felt like nothing. When I hit burnout in 2017, as I had to quit studying and working to focus on my mental health, I realized how ludicrous this idea is. I am good enough; I don't need to proof myself to be just that. I learned to love myself having nothing to show for it. My house was a depression hole and I was too ashamed to even be seen in a supermarket. This was the moment I decided that the only opinion that matters about me is my own. I noticed so many of my progammed beliefs and thoughts were in essence internalizing the gaslighting and negativity of others, they were not my own voice! I started to talk courage and compassion into myself, to embrace myself at my lowest point ever.  Since then, I have been able to become my own best friend. I can see through the bullshit of negative beliefs very quickly now, to the point I laugh as soon as I think it.

I've seen 7 therapists, sometimes just a short-term treatment of 3 consultations, other times 1,5 year of extensive treatment. I have done ""talk therapy"", CBT, schematherapy and a whopping 24 sessions of EMDR. 

In early 2022 I found the crucial tipping point; after my last sequence of EMDR treatments, and finding the right medication of a mild mirtazapine dosis, I managed to control my own dysregulation and have since not suffered anymore from the destabilizing effects of CPTSD. 

I also landed a great job by the end of 2022, and I negotiated an almost double income. These are boons from overcoming CPTSD; I have more confidence in valueing myself highly, and my trauma-fueled hypervigilance has turned into a good skill at reading and talking to people, while differentiating between myself and others emotionally. I am now able to make a clean slate financially and invest in becoming financially independent and retiring early.

Along the way, I have made many good and safe friendships with people who reflect my values; emotionally intelligent, hardworking, inclusive, kind, curious, generous, adventurous, humerous and successful people. They played an enormous role that I am forever thankful for in evaporizing my shame-complex. Picking the right people to associate yourself with has been a battle, but I have cut every person who brought me down, and I am not that socially shy to make new friends. Making friends is a skill you can refine.

I have remolded the relationship with my family, and restored the respect and closeness with my father and mother. We have tackled difficult conversations and I thank them for their courage to partake in that journey with me.

I am 33 now and I feel like I can start the next book of my life. I no longer have anything that holds me back or requires focused attendance to repair. All I can do is thank the strength, resilience and belief of my former self that better times can be forged with dedication and patience. 

I understand that the work is never truly done, life will always throw a curveball, but I got the tools to deal with it. I don't care about going to the 8th therapist if I find it necessary. The shame about seeing a therapist is completely gone. I inform all my doctors ahead of time I have CPTSD, so that they can get to know me when I am regulated and stable, so in the event I slip back for whatever reason, it won't be a huge stumbleblock to ask for help and it won't need much explanation.

I don't think my healing journey is extraordinary. I think if I can do it, so can others. Reject all the deflating and demotivating messages of the world how ""you're stuck"" and ""this cannot ever be made right"" and keep forging that path. Even victim support organizations have told me ""with your trauma it will take you a decade to feel right"", and by despising and rejecting such ideas I made it through. I chose to believe in myself, my resilience and my ability to carve a life for myself from surviving to thriving, no matter the opinion, even of ""experts"". You are a diamond in disguise! That is your secret. Let nobody tell you otherwise."
CPTSD,Repressed memory “snapping back” into my mind,18wxzkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18wxzkx/repressed_memory_snapping_back_into_my_mind/,https://www.reddit.com/user/SandwichUnlikely5032,SandwichUnlikely5032,2024-01-02 19:32:42,Repressed memory “snapping back” into my mind,"I don’t know how else to explain this other than last night I woke up and was lying awake trying to go back to sleep. I’m 30F, married to a loving husband and some things I’ve kept to myself for a very long time due to chronic shame and blame. 

I remember being a child and touching other children inappropriately- I was around 5-8 years old. I also have very few memories from around this time. Last night for some reason I was thinking about things I physically feel repulsed by when my husband does them to me sexually. Nothing degrading, very normal stuff. But one thing in particular I remember thinking “wow I really hate that for some reason…” then suddenly, immediately an image in my head of me doing that thing with another child popped into my head. It was like all at once it made sense that I don’t like it because for one, I equate it with shame (I’m so ashamed I did this to other children) and disgust. I’m very concerned my dad did this to me.

When I’m around my dad today, I recoil if he tries to touch me. I have small children and my gut reaction to him touching my children was “stop.” I didn’t say it but I felt it. I have no memories of him doing anything to me but my body is like “no!”

To clarify more, last weekend I found a file folder in my moms storage unit of profiles of my dad discussing prostitutes with other men, discussing how he and his brother enjoyed doing graphic sexual things with prostitutes together. It was like I was meant to see that to help piece some things together.

I had counseling today and my therapist said it’s likely I’m starting to remember real things now that I’m starting to heal. She said almost all of her clients describe recovering repressed memories in the same way - like pieces of a puzzle snapping together and having a sense of understanding about it.

I don’t WANT this to be true. Guess I’m just looking for someone to describe their experience remembering repressed memories so I can know if what I’m experiencing was real.

Also, my parents are divorced. I was no contact for one year with him due to feeling betrayed by him having affairs. I didn’t know he was soliciting prostitutes. He lives states away so we only see him once a year if that. He’s clearly a narcissist and has always been abusive. I didn’t remember these specific things"

I cut contact with my friends and family for 5 years now. I only discovered I had CPTSD in the past 2/3 years and I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress even though I have not been to a therapist.. the emotional flashbacks are really much more sparse now though I just had one on New Year’s Eve.. 

I do this thing where once a year or a few months i get curious enough and I go on Facebook and look everyone up. It used to be I wasn’t able to see any updates of my family without a huge emotional flashback and being non-functional for days. But then I’ll repeat it maybe a year later and the intensity of the flashback gradually lessens.. I went on again today, started looking at pics of my niece, and my brother posted a pic of them with his wife, our dad and our grandma. My dad was basically the source of all my trauma, and idk if my brother made up with him or my dad had a come to Jesus moment or whatever. But when I saw the picture I was not triggered? I have not seen him for 5 years.. Like I can’t see myself speaking to my parents still but I feel I can make contact with my brother. Am I cured now or smth.. I can’t believe I’m not getting an emotional flashback..

Is it possible any of you have gotten rid of them for good? I feel oddly at peace and idk what’s going on..

My only problem now is thinking of reconnecting with my friends but not being able to tell them why I isolated because I don’t think they’d believe I struggled with CPTSD because I look so fine.."

I can't even take care of myself either, as I'm typing this I'm literally covered in filth and dried period blood. And if I won't be able to constantly daydream and live in peace in isolation I'd rather just die. I tried asking my sister for advice about SSI and I tried my best to imply that my Dad abuses me and I told her how horrible my mental health was but uh...she didn't help and just spouted religious nonsense at me :/ Actually even when I told her directly about my Dad abusing me a few years ago she didn't do anything about it then. Is this really the end? I mean it's really comforting that I get to die but it still feels scary.  
It's kinda funny how I've always fantasized about moving out when I turned 18 but I'm 18 now and I'm still here. Like, this is a ""so that was a fucking lie"" moment. And when I got sent to that horrid TTI facility for truancy I thought that I would finally be able to leave my Dad for good. When the caseworker and therapist there said that I would get sent back if I didn't give them a reason for why I didn't want to go back, I actually told them that my Dad abuses me. I actually did it. That was such a HUGE thing for me. And you know what they did? They told my probation officer that I wanted to go back and that they saw no problem sending me back. And even after that when I called my probation officer and told him that I couldn't be here and that I couldn't function he told me to just get emancipated. It's so silly no? No matter what I do it'll always be the same result.  
This is all honestly such a pain and I don't know what to do I just wanna die forever DX

I had a budget on how much I want to spend. Somehow other people were more tight with money, asked me to order and pay the Uber and I ended up paying alone because I didn’t want to upset anyone. This is just one example.

I was able to go out to see and talk to human beings less times than I can count on one hand last year. If it wasn't for groceries or necessities. A few days before the year ended I went to a nightclub by myself. I didnt even drink, i just wanted to dance and sing, bond with other people over shared music taste. But of course it was a big deal in my family. I went out the house and the cameras caught me going outside, and as I walked to the train station to buy my train ticket, the woman that gave birth to me pulled up in her car. Yelling at me and telling me I can't go by myself, forcing her way into my trip.

I was exhausted by the time I got home, because she refused to be ready on time, by the time I needed to leave. Because of her, we ended up missing the train and experienced about 2 hours in delays due to it. We had to wait out in the freezing cold because the train we missed was the last train before a technical issue happened that caused delays, that maneuver would throw off the train schedule for the rest of the night.

I turn 24 this year, and this is my last push to escape before I give up and probably kill myself. My last compromise is that I'll be out here by November.

I live in failure. I tried to move out in 2020, and was denied because I couldn't do direct withdrawal from my job (I was unemployed and planning to get a job AFTER moving). That sent me into a deep freeze of depression, that I haven't been able to crawl out since. I tried getting a job recently but I only lasted one day before needing to quit. The jobs demands of me were not sustainable, and I would likely end up injured and sick if I continued. I'm autistic and unable to hold down any job.. I'm also unable to drive currently.

So no means of making money to escape.

I used to work in restaurant industry. They treated us inhumanely but pay was just above state minimum. My physical health declined quickly at the job. Fail.

I did delivery for one day, I didn't last since the job was fucked up with their ""on-call"" surprise calls. Fail.

I've been trying to make and sell cosmetics and handmade jewelry. A local store took about a dozen of my items, and didn't want to take anymore. Setting up selling platforms is overwhelming, I don't even know if it will be worth it, but im trying. It's not even gonna make me much but pocket change, after fees and shipping... it's not a mortgage. It's not food money. Even if I succeed, I'll lose all my time to creating product, listing, marketing, and shipping product. All for it to not pay enough. Fail.

I'm trying to learn web design so maybe I can have a ""real job"", but by hearing how difficult it is to actually land a job, I don't have much faith. There's no guarantee I can learn all of this and not have my efforts wasted. Like all of my efforts have been wasted everywhere else in my life. If it was that easy, wouldn't everyone else have done it?

I feel like nothing is worth it at this point, to even be realistically doing decent in life. Four fucking years down the drain. Even further back that I failed all those times I tried to run away as a kid. And staying with my parents so long. I think I deserve it at this point. I wished I wasn't forced into dependence so I could escape at 18 like many traumatized people do. No, I lost 6 more years of my life. I realized I had to escape at 14 but I was legally unable to do anything.

My therapist can't see me today so I have to wait for my next appointment. So here I vent and seek support if anybody is willing. Happy new years everyone, I hope we all have a better year."

I’m not sure if I’m freaking out over nothing but I couldn’t stay there.

(Warning-some discussion of gynecology below, I will try to not be totally graphic)

This was my first time at this particular doctor. She was highly recommended by my neighbors and has good Google and Zocdoc reviews. But while I was waiting for her in the exam room, she initiated a speakerphone call from the hallway right outside the door. She called a diagnostic lab to get test results for a patient who was already there in the office for a follow up appointment. She identified the patient by full name and age—this was the first major problem. The person on the other end of the phone gave her the details of the test results—second major problem and proof (to me at least) that this doctor has terrible judgment to place such a call in a non-private area on fucking speakerphone.

The worst part about all of this is that the patient has cancer. It’s a relatively rare form of cancer, especially for someone as young as this patient is (the doctor gave her age). And some random stranger knew about it before she did, unless she was the patient in the exam room next to me. I could hear someone coughing in that room. I hope to god it wasn’t her because if it was then she just found out that she has a devastating disease in a brutal way.

If I had been thinking clearly I would have opened the door of my exam room and poked my head out into the hallway so that the doctor might realize that people in the exam rooms could hear her. But I massively freaked out and could barely get my clothes back on to get out of there. 

Now that I’m home I keep telling myself that I’m okay, I’m safe, and even if I overreacted by fleeing my appointment it was the right thing to do for me. There were other, more minor things that happened before the phone call that made me uncomfortable at that office. But I can’t stop thinking about the woman with cancer. I hope she’s got all the support she will need."

I pick up and say “Yes?”

On the other end: “Hello here is X, who am I talking to?”

I hang up immediately, the sickly sweet voice of my evil brother still ringing in my ears. The number goes into my block list the next minute.

It has been six years since I went no contact with my entire family for good reason. During those years my mother tried to triangulate once and I received two obituary notices of extended family in the mail (at my published address).

Who gave him this number? It is not listed anywhere. Only one person who works in an industry built on confidentiality – and also counts my family as customers – has it. A few others who have no official relation to my family have it.

There have been a handful of incidences, where it was not unthinkable that they bribed people. There have been inexplicable, large stumbling blocks. Those are impossible to prove, but today‘s call renders the suspicions more real.

I have been going to great lengths so they can‘t figure out my physical address or anything they can use against me. Will have to step up my game once more.

I really feel like if I could just hire someone to totally clean and organize my house I would be able to maintain it, but every time I come home, I slip into a depression and everything just gets worse. I can’t cook (dirty dishes dirty fridge, feels pointless to go to the grocery store) so I end up spending so much $$ on takeout. My bed is full of crumbs. I recently got a kitten and love her and clean up as much as possible but there is also some litter around and that feels unsanitary, and it makes me feel gross. Every time I’m home I get terrible tension headaches. All I want to do is get high and lay in my gross bed. I did my laundry but my apartment is so small with no closets so a lot of my clothes just stay out, usually out on my desk or chairs. So then I can’t use my desk or chairs when doing online work - so I work in bed. This is terrible for my mental health. I am so privileged to have a well off family and I’ve always thought at least if things got really bad, they would help. But I don’t want to admit they are that bad. I’ve distanced myself from my family and it would feel so shitty to ask them for $$ now. I am looking for a new apartment and would have to ask my dad to co-sign because all my income is freelance or gig work. My partner is older and the other day he mentioned his credit card bill was $60k from the holidays and I asked him if he paid that all off at once and he said yes. I’m crying just thinking about that now. I don’t want his money but it makes me so fucking sad everyone is struggling and this jerk who is unfortunately very kind and had a nice upbringing and no existential crises can just… succeed in life. Who does that?? I’m so jealous. 

I’m becoming so cynical that I will never be able to function in this society and I don’t know that I want to. But I do, or I wouldn’t be fighting this hard. I have goals and am in school for carpentry and have 2 other professions (in which I don’t work much at, but want to) but it seems like I am always keeping my head above water and not making progress. Even getting a new apartment would mean that I’d have to repair all the shit I’ve let go in my current place. I need motivation or i am going to slip fully into being non functioning. I am considering checking myself into a hospital but it isn’t “that” bad and I feel like that would only make things worse. The only thing keeping me from it is my partner, I was getting better and I am too embarrassed to fully collapse, but I’m so close. I don’t fucking care.

CPTSD,Mom says i’m lying about my childhood trauma,18wv1ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/18wv1ch/mom_says_im_lying_about_my_childhood_trauma/,https://www.reddit.com/user/AngelicTeabag,AngelicTeabag,2024-01-02 17:35:29,Mom says i’m lying about my childhood trauma,"I had a meeting with a psychologist about the results of my assessment and my mom basically insisted on being there too (even though i’m 18). Well the psychologist started talking about how I have childhood trauma and my mom almost immediately starts talking about how she was a great parent and how I was born with something wring with me. After walking out of the meeting my mom went off on me telling me I lied to my psychologist and that I was the one that gave her trauma with my bad behavior as a child. 

&#x200B;

Now I can’t help but wonder if my brain is just making it all up, if maybe i’m exaggerating and it wasn’t as bad as I thought. My childhood feels so fuzzy the more I get older I remember less and less. Even though I know for sure my mom would be neglectful and passed out drunk a lot of the time while also having hurt me physically, I can’t help but feel as if maybe  i’m looking for trauma, especially since it didn’t happen every day, though it feels like it did. 

&#x200B;

I went to ask my dad for confirmation as he’s the only sane person in my family, but even though he agreed about the alcoholism, instability, emotional abuse, and neglect, he said he never witnessed my mom hurting me that badly even though I REMEMBER showing him scratch marks and bruises she had given me when I was little, but he says to his knowledge there were other explanations for that even though I have a faint memory of my mom beating/scratching me, granted it’s only a single memory but I have a gut feeling she definitely did it more than once. 

&#x200B;

I just feel so… empty? broken? I don’t know. It feels like an important word that’s on the tip of your tongue but you can never quite remember it. I feel so stupid for blaming my mom on traumatizing me when for all I know I could be over exaggerating in order to make myself feel more validated for my problems. I just want to remember correctly."

SPOILER WARNING","I very recently found out about my CPTSD and in the past 3 months dove into learning about myself and doing a lot of introspection etc. During this time while doing some projects with my partner we decided to watch madoka, while I was in the middle of learning about toxic shame and why I do these things to myself etc. I had seen this series before but my partner had not. But being in the middle of reading books about trauma... watching the series had a new light for me. Its the books animated. Its toxic shame and cptsd and fawning and flight mode. 

 I finished Evangelion for the first time yesterday. I had heard that fans really hated the ending but I had no idea what would happen besides clapping. The last two episodes are literally me in shame. Its me reading these books learning about CPTSD. Its all of that.  At the very end he finally finds value in himself. I didn't dislike the ending, it felt so timely... but I also do think it does end too fast. He figures out he can just be valuable its not something he has to do. It doesn't make sense he figured it out yet for me though. I cant figure that out. I don't know how to just be valuable without getting my worth from my work or how useful I am etc.

 I don't know what I want to try to say with this besides wanting to talk to others and if they saw what I saw. Have yall watched media in the past even like cartoons for kids after learning about cptsd and saw things in a new light? I think if i ever feel healed I will play the clapping scene. I have seen it linked as like a joking meme, something stupid but I think that might have been an insulting context. What he figured out is big and important and hard... its worth celebrating.

I just had a thought that perhaps it's been boundaries 🤔 like when a person with healthy self esteem would set boundaries that was foreign to me so it would feel like rejection so I would gravitate away from that.

I've also thought for a long time that humour was part of it, like I found those with fucked up homes had the same kind of humour as me.

We are all amazing. 

I was abandoned as a baby so I had PTSD all my life, didn't help that the reasons kept pilling on. 

I have disassociated since I can remember, I didn't know what that was until the past few years. 

When I was in high school I thought I was hearing voices, but now I know I was just coming in and out of it. 

Ever since I started to really learn about PTSD I realize that so many things that my body did was disassociation.

There was a pipe bomb at my neighbor's house across the street from me, being that I am a veteran that lives in Israel I guess it was too much and I got a seizure. Second one this year. 

I used to function and disassociate and  that would get me in a lot of trouble and risked my life more times than I remember. (pudum pum! Love a good pun.)

The more I learn about myself and my symptoms the more freedom I feel. I used to drink a ton of caffeine and do a lot of stimulating drugs because I kept ""falling asleep.""

I don't drink or do drugs anymore I am sober. I smoke medical marijuana and for me personally, it saved my life. 

Sometimes, a lot of times, I'll judge myself for ""wasting time staring"". Even with what I know now, sometimes I still get intolerant and judgmental towards myself. 

I was disassociating earlier today and thought to myself: It's almost like my brain gets possessed. 

I always remind myself: There is life with PTSD

I even enjoy my life something I never thought I would say.

Anyway, I’m going on medication at some point, and the Psychiatrist suggested I go on either Sertraline or escitalopram (?) or fluoxetine, Ive heard of sertraline and Fluoxetine, But never heard of escitalopram?.

Can anyone that takes any of these medications let me know what they’re like? The symptoms? Do they stop your brain with the horrible intrusive thoughts?.

Even though I'm being supported by my friends and family, I can't help but feel like I'm not valid. 
The main reasons for that are that my flashbacks look different, they're not in form or images like they describe it. They're just intense feelings that take me back to that time, such as fear, anxiety and shame. My flashbacks don't cause me to panic, I either can't breathe or feel like im about to throw up or I dissociate through them. Other than that, I'm relatively calm. I'm easily triggered but half the time I can't even describe what had triggered me, it happens so randomly and sometimes it looks like it happened for no reason. 
It's really hard for me to deal with it, I can barely function and that overwhelming guilt that I'm faking is not helping. I know it's kinda stupid, but I really need some advice on that or at least someone to talk to about it."

I have stress, anxiety and depression alongside it.

It was really bad for a few years, I couldn’t sleep, function, remember anything, didn’t understand what was happening, and lots of nightmares and fear. I’ve managed to get some control by not doing things that trigger me. I wouldn’t leave my home and worked online.

I get triggered by people, places etc. I realise I now just avoid going or being around people/places that trigger me.  I can’t go back to how I was before, that’s really scary as I had no control over things or
me and seemed like I was crazy to others.

I go through so much mental thinking about situations etc before taking any action.  I had an job interview yesterday and in the morning all I could do was think about should I go or not. It’s in the same company I work for and my counseller said it is abusive I should stop but I need the money.  I went and now I wish I hadn’t - I’m completely down again and stressed out.  

Am I making things worse for myself? I go through periods where I can’t do things nothing interests me, to not being able to sleep and trying to navigate ways to get through things.  Getting everyday things done is really difficult my house is a mess and I have no motivation.  Every time I feel
motivated I get triggered and sink.  Is this how ptsd shows up.

Now the only way I can function is to not do much and only after thinking carefully about it.  If I feel any type of stress I stop and do nothing, to avoid it getting worse.  I have no routines that I can keep.

I have never really understood it.  Can anyone help me out to understand what is going on."

I tried what I could to save someone else but was unable. I’ve done years of EMDR and have gotten used to the new normal but lately I’ve been struggling. 

As Bessel Van der Kolk says in his book, The Body Keeps Score, it really does…keep score. My PTSD has been triggered lately and I have no idea why. Recently the unaliving ideations have been popping up and they’re so intense, the flashbacks I thought I had conquered have been making appearances as well, albeit in less triggering ways than before. The problem is that I’ve been feeling triggered so many times lately and I have no idea why. My body is feeling things that my brain is not intuned to. 

I feel like a fraud, wandering about like a normal person, pretending like things are okay, but I’m so fucked up inside and I can’t tell anyone because I don’t want or need for them to worry about me, not that they’d really understand anyways. I hate that the thoughts of how I would end things consume so much of my time. Even when things are okay, they seem to be lingering in the background. 

I hate feeling so fucked up and I really miss who I used to be. I hate the new fucking normal, it’s sucks and is anything but normal. 

I’ve taken a minute to regroup and am not going to hurt myself but just needed to get this off my chest. I hope you all are doing okay. Big hugs ❤️"

- Posttraumatic Stress (PTS)  
- Posttraumatic Stress Injury (PTSI)


&nbsp;


Stigma associated with PTSD is definitely a problem but do you think changing the name will actually make a difference?  
Do you think the terms *Posttraumatic Stress* or *Posttraumatic Stress Injury* would describe your mental struggles more accurately than the term *Posttraumatic Stress Disorder*?  
How do you feel about the term *Disorder* in general?"

I suffer from PTSD stemming from an incident with a police officer in my home in 2017. I have been attempting to deal with the psychological ramifications since that time. Some of my coping mechanisms have not been the healthiest choices. Instead of peace, I found legal troubles and brand new ways to break. 

I have now taken on healthier methods of trying to cope, including talk therapy, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medication, and going to school to pursue a master's degree in psychology to help me better understand my own mind.

That background is painful but important to share, both as I try to finally heal AND as my PTSD has been triggered this year by another incident with police abuse of power and lies. 

Going to local law enforcement got me called a liar and opportunist; the prosecutor would sooner burn me at the stake than take me at my word. I have been branded a criminal who thinks she is above the law, regardless of what the truth might be.

I have never wanted to be the center of attention, preferring to fly under the radar and work behind the scenes, but this time, they are taking too much from me. They're taking my voice. They are making me feel so small, so unimportant, that I wonder if any of this is even worth it. They're taking my life, the one I am trying so hard to build for MYSELF, for maybe the first time ever. That's why I am writing this. If I don't speak now, I know I never will. 

The question is: should I challenge the system? Should I step out of the shadows and try to shine light on how horribly flawed law enforcement is in this very small town, with even smaller minds? Is it worth it?"

I always hate using the fact that my illness has a role in the way I think or act because I don’t want to view myself as an attachment to it. It just tends to feel reductive and as if I’m using it as a scapegoat. But I really can’t ignore the impact it has in my relationships. 

My relationship was going in a direction that was good, he knew some of the stuff that I went through, what some of my triggers were, what ptsd looks like, etc. A lot of it I thought I had under control but boy was I wrong. I never really realized how getting into a healthy relationship exposed how bad I was at being in one and that I never really understood the extent of my ptsd. 

When I was in an unhealthy relationship, it was easy to have those feelings of mistrust, that this person is using me and/or really doesn’t love/care for me, something is going to go wrong, and be proven right when it did. It was easy to just accept that the truth was this person was not good and that what I was feeling was valid. 

Then comes a healthy relationship in which exposed all the things I did that were not healthy. The misguided sense of mistrust when nothing arose but just waiting for it happen because it “always” does, the small action or verbal saying was looked at with a microscope to see if the story was true or not in which it mostly landed on it being not true because of these past unrelated connections, and when everything was going well, waiting for it all to go so wrong soon because nothing ever stays good. 

I can confidently say that all of this is ruining my relationship and I have no idea how to stop it from doing so. Sometimes I wonder maybe I shouldn’t even bother to stop it because why would I deserve any form of love or care; I should just be alone so no one can hurt me anymore. Then I know it’s the ptsd talking after going through that loop but I can never pin point it in the beginning. It just makes me realize more of how much I am a slave to it and that I overestimated my ability to regulate it despite my claim that I am “self aware”. 

It’s just so godamn hard every day and exhausting. I wish I never had to deal with it. I envy the people who can just be at peace with what had happened to them and form healthy connections with the people in their lives. I envy the calmness they have of never looking for signs of danger everywhere or analyzing everything to the finest detail. I envy the idea of just letting go and living in the moment. I envy the idea of feeling loved without the need for a why or that it comes with a condition. Lastly, I envy the idea of just being okay."

It’s been hitting me hard for some reason. Everyone in my life said they could’ve told me themselves I had PTSD but for some reason I never saw it as a possibility. I thought my trauma wasn’t “horrible” enough. I just received this diagnosis about two months ago from my current therapist. I’m 21 years old. While receiving this diagnosis made me feel so much more sane for the things I do and feel, it made me deeply sad because it confirms how bad my childhood was. Did anyone else struggle with their diagnosis initially? How did you cope with it?"

My symptoms decreased quite drastically after a life event. This is not of importance here, just wanted to mention that I did not necessarily had a ""soft recovery"" but it felt more like being kicked out of PTSD into a new reality. So this might not necessarily be a typical recovery-experience?

I'm now finally in the position to start this new chapter in my life and it's the small things that bring me so much joy, although I didn't even know how much I missed them in the last couple of years. Like for example being able to enjoy the morning sun instead of waking up in panic.

There's a lot of silence and peace following recovery. That's exactly what I wanted for such a long time and now that it's finally like this, I struggle with the silence and peace... and I also sometimes feel lost in it.
The PTSD constantly ""kept me busy"" and ""pushed me through the day"". Now I am left with all this freedom of having complete control over my day, what is amazing, but there is also no longer this PTSD-force pushing me. With the PTSD it sometimes felt like I got the smallest things done in a survival-mode and there were times when this survival-mode gave me the energy to do workloads that seemed impossible. Keeping myself busy 24/7 was a mechanism for me to avoid any thoughts about the trauma... Of course, at one point it eventually switched and the PTSD-symptoms became so strong that getting the smallest things done became a challenge.
Now I have complete control over my life again and I also do no longer have this disorder sucking my energy... but I also no longer have something pushing me. 

I need to find a new way to motivate myself and as ridiculous as it might sound, I struggle with this because I am also still in the process of trying to find out who I am now and what I enjoy doing.

Not sure if any of this even makes sense. Just wanted to share the small things I struggle with re-learning how to live a ""normal"" life."

This post might be a bit off topic and what I write here is based on my *interpersonal trauma*.
I categorize these struggles in three categorizes:

**Our society encourages people to speak up about mental issues but is not willing to actually listen.** There's this huge movement of mental health awareness and activism encouraging individuals to speak up but after my personal experience speaking up, it all started to feel like virtue signalling to me. Encouraging others to speak up makes the person feel good but for the individual who actually opens up, it is devistating when they learn that the society that tells them to speak actually doesn't know how to deal with people that struggle with mental disorders. Being pushed away by those I felt comfortable enough to share my trauma with, because they didn't know how to react, was hurtful and led me to be afraid that others will now always see me for my PTSD and not for who I am.

I've came to the conclusion that mental health is openly discussed in our society and that's great, but mental disorders are not. A bad mental health does not equate the presence of a mental disorder. Mental disorders are a dysfunction of our brain/psyche like a dysfunction of an organ, while mental health is about self-care and going through normal emotional stages in life. **While society encourages talking about mental health but not mental disorders, there is a failure to differentiate between the two.** Diagnostic terms are now being used in the context of mental health and start to lose their meaning. Once I started talking about my PTSD, some people thought I just use the term as a buzzword and got a reaction that might be appropriate in the context of mental health but not in the context of a mental disorder. And once I elaborated, I felt treated like I am crazy although what I said is just what PTSD actually is.

Last but not least, I hate every quote on social media now that insinuates that people should put themselves and their needs first as well as that people are not responsible for the well-being of others. Of course, these quotes are not meant to justify people who physically harm others. Nonetheless, **I struggle with society insinuating that we are not responsible for our fellow human beings when our behavior and actions can turn a happy, functional individual into a broken person.** We cannot prevent ourselves from hurting others along the way, but we have a choice to treat others with respect. We need to believe in one another and help one another to heal. If we want a society in which not every second individual is a broken member of our group, we need to take responsibility.

Apologize the venting, I felt the need to write down my thoughts."

Me speaking to my father and others as well:
1. You can’t talk your self out of it. Dad- Well, you can treat it right? Me- I can use the treatments available to help it, but I don’t get a free pass to stop it.
2. It’s physical as well as mental. Dad- “Well, if it’s mental you can get over it” Me “No, I get nightmares where I scream and punch things while sweating profusely too” I don’t  just think about it all the time. 
3. Medicine is not bulletproof Dad-“Well, if you take the medicine and do therapy you should be fine” Me- I am not just great, I am amazing. I have benefited greatly from treatment. But, I still can’t make it go away. Sometimes my body puts out so much stress hormone that I still have symptoms despite the medication”
4. I can’t just make the world stop triggering me “Yes, I can hide somewhere but that comes with it’s own detriment. I have to treat the illness as it comes and keep making strides in the right direction.”
5. No, it’s not just “symptoms” Dad- “Ya, I understand you have that. But it’s just symptoms. It isn’t like your leg is missing. Symptoms aren’t a disease” 😵‍💫🤮
Me” Well, diet and exercise has been proven to treat diabetes, but if you eat chocolate cake you have to take extra insulin. Maybe if you didn’t eat cake ever again you wouldn’t have to do that”
I don’t think I’m special. That’s exactly why I have to make peace with myself. People that are successful doctors and lawyers and business owners can get this too. They have to walk away from their profession sometimes because they aren’t special either. Dad-“You’re not special. Other people have to deal with bad stuff too.” I know that. We all do. But, other people don’t experience nightmares and scream in their sleep when someone says something behind them or they hear feet. 
UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  WHY!!!!!! I can’t take it! I’m pissed. So pissed! I’m not letting it control me which is precisely why I’m treating it!

I developed PTSD because while at work I was sexually assaulted delivering the mail. I was outside and nobody was there to help me. I’m not weak. I’m traumatized!
Now, the Department of Labor is refuting the fact that I cannot go back to work there. That I didn’t have a seizure because of sleep deprivation, coupled with the medication that I take for my PTSD. The hospital summary shows that these two factors caused my seizure. They even ran tests for 2 days while I was admitted and came to this conclusion. Workman’s Comp says “Well, those are symptoms. It doesn’t say PTSD is the cause” I have no income now. I would be making over $50000 a year if I go back. I would have sick leave and vacation time accumulated and good insurance.I would have all of this if I didn’t have PTSD. HELL YA, I’m angry! I think anyone would be pissed.

Therapy cannot erase these memories. Therapy cannot change the past. And that’s ok. I don’t feel like I need to run away from my past anymore. I can accept now that what happened is part of my past.

Recovering from PTSD is just one part of the healing journey. Recovering from PTSD is indeed a very important part of it and key when it comes to returning to a normal life, but the PTSD was just one consequence of the SA and even the PTSD can lead to consequences. For example, my self-esteem and self-worth is still very low and something I have to work on.

Now that the PTSD symptoms are gone, my mental well-being does not depend on the bad things that happened to me. It depends on the good things and the lack thereof. The lack of people caring, the lack of people believing in me, the lack of people loving me despite what happened to me and despite the PTSD. It was not the SA that almost broke me, it was people thinking of me as a broken person and giving up on me."

While people with CPTSD meet the diagnostic requirements of PTSD, they also suffer from additional symptoms. I've shared sources in this subreddit explaining the differences between CPTSD and PTSD but I think it would also be interesting to hear from you how you would explain CPTSD. 

Of course, it's probably difficult to explain how CPTSD differs from PTSD not based on diagnosis criteria but rather personal experience, because there's no personal experience to compare it to. Nonetheless, I hope that the following questions are a good starter:


- I have PTSD and the PTSD-diagnosis was a relief, because everything made sense. How did you feel about the PTSD-diagnosis and did you ever feel like the PTSD-diagnosis truly made sense? 

- How did it feel when you finally received the CPTSD-diagnosis?

- Did the PTSD-diagnosis ever truly help you understand what you're going through?

- Was the CPTSD-diagnosis important for your healing journey?

- How does the CPTSD-diagnosis positively impact your healing journey in a way the PTSD-diagnosis didn't?"

In the beginning there will be 4 days with 4 mottos:

* **Motivation-Monday**  
Nobody likes Mondays. So each Monday there will be a chat post to encourage each other, to share quotes and books that help us on our journey and to reassure each other that we cannot only make it through the upcoming week but also that better days are about to come.
* **Need a Friend-Friday**  
PTSD can be really isolating but a social support system is so important for us to heal. On Friday we’ll have a group chat to talk about stuff that is not necessarily related to PTSD and just have a good time.
* **Scream it out-Saturday**  
Let's be honest, vulnerable and raw. Let's vent out some of the emotions that happen with PTSD on Saturdays.
* **Success of the Week-Sunday**  
On Sundays we’ll have a chat to share our successes we’ve had during the week. No matter how small it may seem to you, success is success and should be celebrated.

Participating in these chats will be voluntary, of course. You can also make posts on these days about topics that could be shared in the chat. It’s simply for those who are interested and prefer talking in a chat over writing a post."

But right now I'm crumbling from small problems and getting triggered by things I recognize as such yet nevertheless keep occurring. 
Last summer things briefly seemed to be going uphill (I was doing job that felt interesting, got paid enough and was doing things I thought I'd never be able to do again (1 day trips to New city for work, 11h days when needed,  learning many new things and most of all constantly meeting new people because of that work and being professional and normal, no anxiety for the most part). 

Then September and October crushed me, it was a constant battle against circumstances up and down like some awful merry go round of unpredictable impossible problems, finding solutions and then a new problem. By mid-November it felt like I was breaking but there were things to handle so I did what I could to help myself. A month later, I was starting to get so e balance and hope back.

And then New year just crushed me. And since then it's been uphill battle again. And there so much to do, and I can't seem to catch. The summer me would have been caught up in a week. But now it's like I'm in a fog and I don't know how February came. I keep pushing myself and I'm just getting more stuck, replacing one problem with another, one trigger for another, I'm trying to plan and do and be good and I'm just not. Every time I get paid important stuff get pushed over for other important stuff. My laptop is in a pawnshop and for 2 months I pay them a few so they can keep it another 30days because the fee is less than getting it back and I know ifi lose it I won't be able to afford such for years, and the one I work on has been falling apart for 5 years. Still, I have work and once I finish it I'll be able to get it back. But my deadline is this week (I can push the deadline but I get paid on completion and I need it). It's a good pay too and it would help me so much to try and move forward. But the week is crushing me. I had a trigger that hit me harder than it has happened in a year(literally lost few hours in distress and it felt like minutes). I got myself a nasty cold(not the virus but mot nice on a deadline). I just feel crushed and scrambled and steamroller. I know like this it sounds stupid and trivial, but I'm so lost right now and I have no outlet. It's like I'm surrounded by ticking time bombs and I Don know which will blow up in my face first.

I'm sorry, if you read until here. I'm just lost, and my motivation keeps going subzero. I feel either numb or too much, it's making me crazy."

A key part of the memory is the somatic feeling of my newly grown in leg hair being touched and commented on sexually.

Therefore, my own hairy legs are a trigger for me and bring me flashbacks of being sexually assaulted. Even me touching them brings up the trauma.

I don't want to shave my legs all the time to avoid a triggering memory. I also don't want to shave all the time bc it's time and money and energy spent better other places; I'd rather just shave periodically.

So I'm looking for ideas in how to heal this. I want to be able to have and touch my legs regardless of the state of their hair and not be triggered into a flashback. Anyone have ideas?

I'm in ART - Accelerated Response Therapy - and we will work on this, but sometimes we can go a while between sessions for different reasons. And I'd like to work on it now."

I am a huge tomboy and always felt more comfortable being masculine presenting, even though I identify as female. To this day, I always feel more like ""me"" with buzzed hair (military-style almost) than with any other haircut.

My mother ended up being the one to cut my hair that first time, and she did in a way that to this day still haunts me. She had me keep my hair in a braid, then really roughly spent almost an hour trying to cut through it with dull scissors instead of just cutting my hair while loose. Then having me go wash it while my hair was wrecked like that. There were a whole lot of other things that went wrong (in addition to my mom being my abuser, so I was already terrified).

Then when I go to get a haircut at a dresser, I get talked down to and have the hair dressers spend so so long trying to convince me to take a feminine haircut. One time, I was done with arguing and said that if she really didn't feel comfortable using sheers, she can use scissors. Charged me $70 for a haircut that should have been $20. 

So I still feel more comfortable with buzz hair. I feel more confident and stronger. But I am so terrified of getting a haircut. I don't want to get another episode because I am scared of confrontation. This is important to me, but I also feel so silly about being terrified by a haircut. My mom isn't even the one giving the haircut! I also don't want to get pressured into taking a haircut I don't want, just to avoid arguing. 

I had been planning to go today to a nearby Supercuts, but I am literally shaking right now. I know a haircut can seem kind of silly, but advice would be appreciated. I don't have any friends or family to go to for this. >.<"

I wasn't allowed to have a lot of foods, wasn't allowed to watch a lot of shows, and was generally fairly isolated from my peers. Lately, I've been trying to do more things that I wasn't allowed to do as a kid, both of the way to heal my inner child, and prove to myself that sometimes my mom's voice in my head is not right.

About a week ago I had my first bowl of SpaghettiOs made by my boyfriend. I spent a long time just playing with it and staring at it, but with his encouragement I managed to eat about half of it. Well it's definitely not something I'd eat again, I'm happy I did it. I also bought myself a box of gushers, because that's another thing I wasn't allowed to have. I bought myself a cat onesie because I wasn't allowed to make 'frivolous' purchases. Hell, lately I've been staying up past my bedtime on weekends, just a silly little act of rebellion.

I don't know why, but this genuinely seems to be helping. I've always been very insecure about the fact that I'm very sheltered and so frequently I'm unable to relate to the people around me. I haven't watched a single episode of SpongeBob, the first time I watch Shrek was as an adult. Now, one by one, I'm letting myself do the things that weren't allowed at home, and it feels quite nice."

After being diagnosed with PTSD I reflected a lot on the relationship and to this day I struggle with guilt for what my ex-partner went through. I know it is not my fault and I would never suggest anyone with PTSD should be criticized for having a mental disorder. So I don't necessarily recommend those with PTSD to watch the video as I don't want anyone to feel guilty for suffering in front of their loved ones because we need our loved ones to help us through this difficult time.
Nonetheless, I've decided to post the video because it describes how I felt seeing my partner suffering because he wasn't able to help me and someone here might feel the same way. It may also helps loved ones to know that they are allowed to acknowledge that they are suffering too due to the PTSD even if it is indirectly and that they need to take care of their own mental health as well."

diagnosedPTSD,My story (in short),10f9ngx,https://www.reddit.com/r/diagnosedPTSD/comments/10f9ngx/my_story_in_short/,https://www.reddit.com/user/Banshee99T,Banshee99T,2023-01-18 15:09:54,My story (in short),"I grew up in a household with Jehovah's witnesses.
This means strict rules and basically no friends (only conditional love).

My father was fun when I was very little, but suddenly stopped paying attention to me.

Mother probably has (undiagnosed!) Borderline Personality Disorder (this is what my therapist thinks).
She had crazy moodswings and blames everything on others.
She also badmouthed my father, wich resulted in me hating this man (wich I'm now realising and slowly resolving).

Mother once told me she wished I was never born.
I was their unexpected, unwanted third child.
And laughed about my suicidal thoughts at the time.

They have never had a good marriage, but stay together because JW's cannot get divorced.
Our household was a warzone.

I got bullied at school.
And was sexually abused by my brothers.

I've been going to my therapist since I was 16, until I was 18 I think, mostly to keep my head above water and not k* myself.

I moved out at 19 and realised I needed help, so I went back.
Been in therapy for around 3-4 years now. (I'm 23).

Diagnosed with CPTSD almost immediately and got diagnosed with SID recently.

I'm now getting an education in psychology and am pregnant with my first baby ❤️

For anyone struggling.
We will never be 100% anymore, but it can get better!
I still struggle a lot and have lots of symptoms, but I'm still here."

You may don’t want to have to wait for months to finally get an appointment. You may do not have the financial means or access. You may feel ashamed to open up to a stranger in real life. You may fear that you are overreacting and seek confirmation that your suffering is severe enough to contact a psychologist/psychiatrist.

I understand why you would like to hear someone’s opinion here or why you are scrolling through the posts looking for a similar experience. However, I’d like to explain to you why this might not be a good idea. Our own experience doesn’t make us experts. 

PTSD is diagnosed based on the nature of event you've experienced (Trauma) as well as the symptoms you are suffering from.
Just because you struggle with a past experience, it doesn’t automatically mean that you suffer from PTSD. In the context of PTSD, there is a quite specific definition to the term «Trauma» and if your experience doesn’t meet that definition, you won’t be diagnosed with PTSD regardless of the symptoms you have.
Whether your experience does meet that definition or not is up to an expert to decide.
Neither you or we can make that determination, because we don’t know your life story. We don’t know if you share everything with us about that experience or not. We don’t know if you downplay what happened. So when you get the answer from us that your experience doesn’t meet the definition of Trauma, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you don’t have PTSD. At the same time is it possible that you unconsciously exaggerate the event because it becomes a proxy for another issue you struggle with.
If your experience meets the definition of Trauma, it doesn’t automatically mean that you have PTSD. PTSD is just one of several mental disorders that we can suffer from after experiencing Trauma. The symptoms of mental disorders are often overlapping with other mental disorders and therefore a differential diagnosis is important. It could also be that there is comorbidity. So when you read about our symptoms here and they do not fully align with yours, it could be because it is another mental disorder or because you or the person who has written the post suffers from more than one mental disorder following a traumatic event.
And keep in mind when you read posts here that you can’t be sure that they really have PTSD (f.e. factitious PTSD).

Even with all of this in mind, the responses you get from us when you ask us if what you have sounds like PTSD or when you read about our experiences, it will ultimately influence you and may even affect your mental health.

**And last but not least: When you scroll through these posts, something you read could trigger you. Not just trigger you, but you suddenly remember a lot more of what happened. This could put you in a very dark place. So if you think you don't remember exactly what happened, don't do this to yourself! Putting the memories together is something that needs to be done in therapy, so that the therapist can be there for you when these memories come back. No matter how strong you think you are, there is a reason why we suppress these memories.**

If you find yourself in this subreddit, you clearly struggle. It doesn’t matter if it is PTSD or not, you need to contact a licensed professional because you are suffering."
