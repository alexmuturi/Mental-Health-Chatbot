CPTSD,Feeling like I was made to be unlovable,"I don't know if it was the emotional neglect, the psychological abuse, medical abuse, bullying, the CSA, whatever. I'm a mess right now. I feel like a horrible monster that somewhat a lot of people see as attractive, but under the facade I'm still a monster.  As if I was someone who was built for being unlovable and despised, physically and emotionally, since I was born. I keep working and working but I still don't feel fit for this world."
CPTSD,DAE not know what to do with themselves when they have time?,"See title.

I used to be the person full of hobbies (biking, drawing, reading, writing, walking, gaming) who really disliked people who never knew what to do with their free time and would be clingy. Now I am one of them.

Through years of hard depression and su.c.dal.ty thanks to cptsd I have stopped all my hobbies. I entrench myself in work and by now also meeting people and sometimes obligatory projects (like drivers license) to an extent that leaves me without any free time.

When I have free time and am alone I lie on the couch and do nothing. I think I even pity myself? Also hate myself a lot for being this way. Sometimes I watch Netflix for hours, doom scroll Reddit. Waste time browsing the internet. I try to sleep a lot.

Sometimes itâ€™s better and I am interested in baking or gaming again, but super rarely. I do take regular walks by now though. But I have no â€œrealâ€ interests anymoreâ€¦ used to love to read, havenâ€™t read in years now.

No interest finding anything new either.

Iâ€™m already 34 and Iâ€™ve wasted my whole life in bed. I had regular fights with my therapist about wanting to solve the â€œlying in bed and wasting awayâ€ being a huge problem for me (he didnâ€™t see it as an issue) and that I canâ€™t be alone either (he didnâ€™t see it as a problem either).

Iâ€™m also ashamed in front of my partner that he sees me like thisâ€¦ either when I do nothing but also when I try something out, then I feel stupid like anybody can see right through me â€œlook at this pitiful idiotâ€)â€¦ makes me feel like Iâ€™m an incapable childâ€¦

It makes me desperately unhappy and idk what to do to change itâ€¦ stems from severe emotional neglect as child (I basically grew up alone, isolated and completely ignored in an abusive household).

DAE relate?"
CPTSD,Yoga triggers me- anyone else?,"I was doing yoga for years as a tool to help me back into my body when I was feeling rough as a form of reconnection. I even went as far as becoming trained in teaching, doing a 200hr training. As my trauma symptoms peaked however yoga would actually start having the reverse effect and would dissociate me. (In retrospect I wonder if I was in fact being dissociated the whole time.)

Started again recently and itâ€™s not as bad as it was but damn, I disconnect hard! Anyone the same? Anyone have any other exercise tips?"
CPTSD,Did anyone else have a parent who said - you can make the choice - do you want ho listen to the sweet loving voice of tell it in or should I beat you?,The child me thought I made the right choice by listening to him. And he said as much. That I had finally done something right . Especially when they kept blaming me for all the things I did wrong . Anyone else ?

CPTSD,Fun house mirroring,"We create our self image by mirroring when growing up, but what if the mirrors were all twisted like in a fun house? No wonder my self image is so distorted."
CPTSD,Did anyone else feel like what they experienced wasn't serious enough to be called trauma,"I never thought I'd ever associate my childhood with that word. I always thought it was exclusive for people who really had it bad, like it wasn't something for me. I never thought too much about my childhood experiences and chalked it up to being normal. Figured I wasn't important and no one would care. But I didn't like all the negative feelings that haunted me so long I just looked into it more and  got better without going into detail."
CPTSD,Isolated for a month,"I've been isolating for a month and I'm starting to feel it take a toll on me. I've been grieving a lot in 2023 and I'm still grieving. It's hard to accept my current circumstances. 

I moved far from my hometown to a large city knowing no one. I'm NC with all of my family. I work from home. I have somewhat of a schedule (despite spending the holidays alone, it was triggering and I couldn't sleep for days) and attempting to join adult classes and group therapy. Other than seeing my therapist once a week and trying to go easy on myself by fully and radically accepting my circumstances, it's been so difficult to feel fulfilled. I don't want to go on dating apps or online apps because they usually don't work for me. We end up having different interests or it fizzles. I'm also not interested in romance or any casual fling at the moment. I am not ready for a relationship as I have no life of my own that I enjoy and I've been codependent in most of my past relationships.

It hasn't been long since I decided to really buckle down to better myself and learn to be independent. It's only been a few months. 

I'm hoping I can practice social skills once I get into these classes and group therapy because it feels like I haven't made a genuine connection or decent small talk in ages. It's been making me anxious. All I do now is work on my mental health, figuring out who I am and what I want, and go into freeze mode. It's extremely lonely, but a lot less chaotic than what I'm used to. Has anyone gone through this?"
CPTSD,Two years sober today,Itâ€™s been quite a ride since my PTSD came back with a vengeance when I quit. But Iâ€™m continuing on into year three.
CPTSD,What can I do to support a partner who has CPTSD?,"My partner (23M) and I (27F) have been together for 5 months. I won't go into to too much detail but he's had a rough life. I have my fair share of traumas too. We're both diagnosed but I've been able to afford therapy and medication consistently while he hasn't.

We see each other a few days out of the week. We both have abandonment issues so whenever we part, there's always some separation anxiety. I've noticed though that as time goes on, his anxiety's only gotten worse. We used to talk each other through it via text for a couple hours then be okay. Now he just keeps to himself and shuts down for a day or two. I try to send him reassuring messages and offer support but I'm not sure if it helps or makes things worse for him.

Should I just give him space and wait for him to reply in these moments? Is there anything I can do to help him regulate?

Alternatively, is there anything you like to hear from your partner or something you'd like them to do for you when you have bouts of emotional dysregulation? Is there anything you don't like?"
CPTSD,"How to not take Externalizers personally, especially when theyâ€™re your family?","â€œExternalizersâ€ are one of the two emotionally immature personalities defined by Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents (book).

My mom is an externalizer. â€œExternalizers don't learn from their mistakes, look to other people to make them happy, and have a coping style that is self-defeating and destructive.â€

I am an internalizer for the most part. â€œInternalizers are sensitive people-pleasers; they feel anxiety when they displease others.â€

We are both externalizers and internalizers in different parts of our lives. But on what Iâ€™m concerned right now, this is an accurate description of both our behaviors on social dynamics/displaying our emotions.

We had an argument yesterday, and her behavior really got to me. She disrespected my boundaries/wishes to end the conversation several times. Right after that she told me awful descriptions of me. â€œThe thing you have to improve isâ€¦â€ â€œYour problem is that you â€¦â€ Iâ€™ve had enough of those comments because I take what people say into heart but those comments are just reflections of her emotional state. I know that intellectually but Iâ€™m still at a lost for what I should do to stop taking whatever sheâ€™s doing to/for me personally. I believe the trick to solving my temper around relentless people like her is to stop taking every inch of her behavior personally."
CPTSD,Crash & Burn,"Let me be the one you call. If you jump, Iâ€™ll break your fall. Lift you up and fly away with you into the night.  


If you need to fall apart, I can mend a broken heart. If you need to crash then crash and burn, youâ€™re not alone.  


Savage Garden was one of my mumâ€™s favourite bands. She used to listen to them all the time, and so did I. When I hear them now, I feel connected to her. She died when I was 12 years old.  


I barely knew her. I knew her as â€œmumâ€. Not Debbie. Not even as a person. Just mum.. How fucked up is it that kids donâ€™t even realise their parents are their own, independent people until itâ€™s far too late? If we knew they had a life before us, hobbies and interests and dreams theyâ€™d given up, would we be such shitty brats all the time?  


I have so many photos. The printed kind, the kind they used to put in albums and keep on the shelf to pull out every now and then and reminisce. I have albums, too. She made them. She wrote the captions and the dates to remind us when those happy times were. Who those people were. What those places were.  
Now all we have are smart phones, and digital albums full of bullshit weâ€™ll never look back on. Nothing real, nothing tangible you can hold. No captions. No handwriting. Well, that or Instagram. I donâ€™t use Instagram. Fuck Instagram.  


Today was a good day. I had an easy, laid back morning. I made a nice lunch. I got myself a massage, then had an appointment with my GP, followed by an appointment with the chiropractor. Self care and health care, right? So why, after such a nice day, when Iâ€™m on the last leg of my drive home, does this song come on and I burst into tears?  


Trauma, friends.  


I heard the words in that song and I thought about her and it felt like she was the one singing them to me. But sheâ€™s not here, she canâ€™t be the one to catch me when I fall. She canâ€™t mend my broken heart, how could she? She took damn near the whole thing when she left.  


And what was I left with? The gift of more trauma. Adults who could never understand me the way she did. Who could never love me the way she did. They love me, sure, but not like that.  


Not just that they canâ€™t understand me, they see the parts of me that she admired as something to squash. Something bad. Something that needed to be (metaphorically) beaten out of me so that I could fit inside the box they built for me. The box society built for me.  


Be a good girl. Good girls donâ€™t talk like that, not so loud, why are you opinionated? Nobody cares what you think about politics. Nobody cares. Good girls clear the table after dinner and load the dishwasher and wipe the table. Good girls go to school on time and finish their homework and get good grades. Good girls clean the house on the weekend. Vacuum the floor, dust the shelves.  


Good girls grow into good women. Good women go to university and get a degree, something like nursing, maybe? Good women find a boyfriend, who becomes a husband, and they look after him. Cook dinner every night before he gets home. Do the laundry every few days so he has clean shirts for work. Keep a grocery list then go to the grocery store and find all of those things, donâ€™t worry about the bright lights and the loud music overhead and the dozens of people standing in the way with their carts and the fact that you donâ€™t know where anything is and even when you find it, why are there so many choices? Which brand is best? Which price seems fair? WHO CAN FUCKING DO THIS SHIT?  


Good women donâ€™t have strong opinions about anything, especially not politics, and even if you do, donâ€™t bring it up around the men. They think youâ€™re a left-wing nut-job lunatic for thinking everyone should be able to afford a house to live in. Everyone should have access to high-quality, free healthcare. Everyone should receive a basic, universal income that is enough to maintain a decent quality of life. Thatâ€™s socialist garbage, that is!  


Good women do all of that, and work 40 hours a week because the mortgage is too much for one man to handle. Thereâ€™s bills to pay, too. And, God forbid, there are ever children to care for. Good women have babies, and look after them. And raise them to be good girls too. On top of all the rest of it.  


I guess Iâ€™m just not a good woman.  


I crashed. I burned. Iâ€™m still burning.  


Who will be the one I call? If I jump, who breaks my fall? Thereâ€™s no one coming to fly away with me into the night.."
CPTSD,Constant slight dissociation?,"Has anyone else experienced this?  I know that acutely, I dissociate when things are bad or I'm upset, it happened in therapy once and I realized afterwards.  But for a while now I've suspected that I'm a little bit dissociated all of the time.  My memory is a complete blur, even giving you details about yesterday would be a struggle.  I'm always tired, and always tense.  But I'm pretty sure I've felt this way for a long long time, maybe over a decade. 

On one hand, it feels weird to me that I could have lived for over a decade in a dissociated state without realizing it, on the other hand, I have these flashes.  Just a few moments where my muscles aren't tense and the world is just clearer.  And 99% of the things used to diagnose me as ADHD are also symptoms of dissociation... And it makes sense to me logically, I have hypervigilance and 24/7 anxiety, so if my fight/flight is constantly active, I could conceivably be in a freeze/dissociate state 24/7. But then again, maybe I'm just imagining it? Maybe this is truly the same way other people experience the world?  Maybe this symptom really is just in my imagination.  It's so hard to tell, it's like a fish in water trying to tell if it feels wet or not.

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone recovered? If so, how?"
CPTSD,"how do I know if I was sexually abused as a child, and by who?","HEAVY TW FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF CHILD ABUSE/NEGLECT- AND MENTIONS OF CHILD ON CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT, GROOMING AND RAPE, AND PARENT SEXUAL ABUSE

I have DID- so that in itself is proof enough that iâ€™ve experienced some pretty terrible abuse and neglect. I was just attempting to write a page on my life and experience growing up with abusive parents- but I had to stop halfway through as I feel exhausted and sick. I know they were abusive, Ive accepted that- but thereâ€™s still so many missing pieces to the puzzle. Is it normal to feel like thereâ€™s always something so much worse and scary lurking hidden in my mind? Like Ive been through hell and back but only have the scars to remind me, not the memories?


One of them being how it ever got to be this bad- Ive show many symptoms of sexual abuse throughout my entire life. It was never identified and treated because my parents refused to take me to professionals- well they wouldâ€™ve never accepted iâ€™m ill anyway and havenâ€™t when Iâ€™ve attempted to open up to them, and they definitely didnâ€™t want to be outed as child abusers. But also I was a smart, happy, social, outgoing kid- so no one suspected abuse- despite me having *clear* issues it seems like no one cared. All my parents, teachers, and school counselors cared about was me getting good grades. 

Whatâ€™s crazy is I remember being a very sad, lonely, and confused kid who lived in my own imaginary world inside my head. I never had friends- and all my time spent outside school was alone, as I was even forgot about my family daily. I knew that I couldnâ€™t show fear or depression because I would be punished for it, as I had been in the past many times. I remember hurting myself on the playground at my elementary school just to get attention from the nurses- who ended up telling me I couldnâ€™t even come back into their office anymore unless I had passed out or broken a bone.

I have a memory of being a victim of COCSA at church while I was around the age of 4- this is also when my hypersexuality began. My parents deny knowing anything about this- but I remember telling them about the experience and being punished for being â€œtoo young to kiss boysâ€. I have heard of the term â€œcovert incestâ€ and struggle to accept that this may of been my reality. There are photos of me naked and bathing hung up in my parents house, and I have memories of my mother showering with me (well after I could bathe myself). Before I started puberty a regular punishment of mine was to strip and bend over, while being smacked on the rear with a hand, belt, spatula, etc. This stopped as I reached puberty because my father felt â€œuncomfortableâ€- which is also when he began to withdraw from me completely and show no interest in me as a person. As a child I was extremely clingy with him and hated my mother- I saw my father as my savior from my bipolar crazed mother but he never did anything to stop the abuse- in fact I suspect my father was my first sexual abuser. My parents spent multiple times during my childhood separated, and during these times I would be taken to my fatherâ€™s every night. I suspect he could be my abuser because I get the same feeling around him as when I am/was around my other sexual abusers- shame, fear, disgust- I feel used and dirty. I also support this worry with many weird and uncomfortable comments I received from him that I remember, and things my mom has said about his relationship to me. I know the people here canâ€™t answer for certain whether he was my abusers- but for people who have been sexually abused by their fathers (and maybe blocked it out)- how did you know? 

After reaching puberty I quickly began to indulge in hypersexuality- I was groomed by people online and IRL. I had multiple sexually abusive relationships- the worst being with an adult man, which began when I was 15 and lasted for two years. My parents knew him well and respected him, they allowed him into their home and into my bed- they often would use their usual isolation punishments on me but made a acception for the man to come over during my punishments. They knew he was raping me, and I was punished whenever they would find the evidence he deliberately hid for them to find.

My punishments my entire life consisted of being screamed at, hit, gaslit and manipulated, berated, trashing my things, and locking me in my room away from everyone- even family. Sometimes I wasnâ€™t allowed to use the bathroom or eat, although it was never long enough for me to soil myself (I think)- I still struggle with disordered eating not related to my image. I also struggled with bladder issues my whole life, and still run the risk of soiling myself in public whenever I leave home- and I did many times in school and at church, etc. 

I have little to no memory of my life- and now as an adult iâ€™m starting to remember things. The other day I have a horrible flashback and things are only getting worse day by day. It feels like itâ€™s all slipping. I have so much to worry about already- between working to survive and afford my bills- barely able to eat and definitely unable to afford therapy- how am I ever supposed to accept and cope with my parents being violent, negligent, and maybe even pedophilic abusers?"

anyway. 

iâ€™m f21 and my new yearâ€™s resolution is to get my shit together. i lost a lot of my childhood/teenage years to trauma of being abused to my parents and self harm. so like many people in my situation, i never made plans for the future because i didnâ€™t plan on living this long

now iâ€™m 21 and clueless and a little worried. iâ€™m not in school, but i have a job and i might get a promotion

i have some goals already set for myself such as learning how to drive and get my license, learn how credit cards work and apply for one, go to therapy, journal, read more and possibly find a trade school with something iâ€™m interested in

iâ€™m in a long distance relationship right now and our goal is to find somewhere to move to and close the distance

i donâ€™t feel comfortable enough to ask my parents. i have my older sister, but id like to try it on my own first.

 but these are all goals that i havenâ€™t even gotten done yet, so any advice for my situation is really appreciated."
CPTSD,Is it normal to lock the door when you go to the bathroom?,"Hi itâ€™s really late and Iâ€™m high and crying my eyes out and I asked some online friends but I need to be sure. Is it rude or bad of me to lock the bathroom door when I poop or shower? I moved away from my family 2 years ago and live with my friends now but before I moved here I would either get walked in on or get yelled at for locking the bathroom door because it implied I didnâ€™t trust them enough and I could get hurt if I slipped or something and they couldnâ€™t come in. I used to take a really long time to pass bowel movements and this pissed off my family so I learned to do it faster as an adult. I am almost 30 now and any time I have to use the bathroom I feel extremely nervous and guilty and scared because I fear getting walked in on or upsetting my friends because I donâ€™t trust them enough. Iâ€™m too scared to even ask the people I live with if this is normal or not. I just donâ€™t know what to do or who to ask, I think I know the answer but I need to hear it from people who donâ€™t know me and wonâ€™t lie to me because they feel guilty or something."

CPTSD,Childhood trauma led me to sexual coercion as a young adult,"Iâ€™m coming up on four years of sobriety in April 2024. Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of reflection or maybe just ruminating about the shame I feel for drinking. 

Iâ€™m from a refugee background, and as a child, I experienced parental abandonment, FGM and SA. When I was 17, a man who was 22 years older started to pay attention to me and give me compliments at the restaurant where he worked.

 As I got older, we became â€œfriends,â€ spending much time drinking in pubs. He enabled my drinking by buying me drinks and giving me a place to sleep. He pressured me into sex and made degrading comments about me.  When I told him I experienced FGM, he raped me to try to prove that I could climax. He would not stop until I faked an orgasm.

 Throughout this time, I made countless trips to detox and different groups to try to get sober.

 Then, one day, I  sat in a bar with my â€œfriend.â€ I met the man who is now my husband. I immediately saw something warm and kind in him. 

For the first four months of our relationship, I was still involved with that friend so that I could keep drinking. After four months of my friend offering me cocaine and booze  to spend time with him, I finally snapped and cut him off completely. He harassed me for weeks with new numbers, but I did not give in. 

I was terrified of losing my husband. I was terrified I would spend my life drunk, degraded and sick. So I got sober and fucking stayed sober. 

I have a beautiful life with my husband and dog. We got married in August in a ceremony his mum had planned. She gives me the care and protection I never received from my mom. I am also building a new career for myself. 

My husband knows that that I was involved with a predator but doesn't know that it took four months before I was monogamous to him. 

I am tortured with guilt. I know I am not wholly responsible when a man twice my age gets me black out drunk, but I am so ashamed that I hurt him back then.  

I need advice. I feel trapped by the mistakes I made when I was drinking. Does anyone have a similar story

P.S. That guy was never a friend."
CPTSD,Guilt about creating boundaries,"TLDR: Has anyone else â€œwoken upâ€ and realized how one-sided all your friendships were due to your fawn response, and now has decided that you want to leave them all behind due to the realization? But then they were also there for you in really bad times so you feel major guilt about it?

For context, I went through a terrible year last year, where I basically had a mental break down and an awakening to how much CPTSD was affecting me. I spend all of last year just trying to get myself stable, and in the process I had some friends who really tried to reach out and be there for me, which I really appreciated (and honestly felt like they saved my life a few times)

But as I have gone on the healing journey, Iâ€™ve also realized how one-sided the relationships always were, and how I really wasnâ€™t truly valued in the way I valued them. This all came to a head on my birthday a few days ago, when after all of the stuff I have always done for everyoneâ€™s birthdays, I was so so disappointed in how irrelevant I felt by all of my friends. Especially after the awful year I had. It woke me up to the fact that this is how itâ€™s always been, that I will never feel enough, and will always feel used in one way or another. 

I am still learning my way out of my own trauma right now, and confrontation definitely brings up a massive fear response in me, because I just feel like I wonâ€™t be heard. So for now I am just not communicating with anyone and have just set a boundary about that. But honestly, I know these are the relationships I chose because of my trauma, and now I know I deserve better. 

But in some ways they have really been there for me, so I am feeling this massive guilt about leaving it all behind. Maybe Iâ€™ll get to a place to talk to them, maybe I wonâ€™t, but would ending these relationships make me a terrible POS?"
CPTSD,Does anyone else have issues with using your voice?,"Iâ€™ve experienced a myriad of trauma all throughout life culminating in the really fun â€œdiagnosisâ€ (as much as it can be) of CPTSD. 

I struggle to use my voice in person, but especially online. I am like chronically online but I never contribute to the communities I belong to. Stray upvotes and stuff but no real comments unless Iâ€™m manic or super passionate. Iâ€™ve had this account as primarily a lurker for 4 years and have only just hit like 900 karma or something. I feel like Iâ€™m not an important enough person to comment. My advice or whatever is not good enough to be heard or seen. Itâ€™s not true, I know this. Iâ€™m a relatively intelligent individual and have good things to say but my brain doesnâ€™t let me. Iâ€™ll type a whole paragraph out and erase it promptly. 

My therapist has me doing some exposure therapy and this is definitely in my chart to ask about this with you guys. 

Does anyone else struggle to use your voice in any space?"
CPTSD,Trying to figure something out,"I'm currently going through Written Exposure Therapy. And it's working but it's also raising a huge question for me. 
For context, the particular trauma I'm writing about and focusing on was being spanked with a leather belt as a kid for ""lying"" when I was telling the truth and didn't stop until I lied and said what the abuser wanted to hear. I was in 3rd grade. 

And today, for the first time, what happened AFTER struck me as weird. Within 2 or 3 hours, I went about everything as normal. Played with myittoe brother, laughed, went on with the day as if it hadn't happened. 

So here's what I'm trying to figure out: How often would I have been hit, to just act like it never happened a few hours later? How often was I hit for it to just seem like normal life? 

I still have a lot of repressed memories, but this one was something I've never forgotten. 

I don't know how to deal with that big question now. I'll take advice, support, anything. I've been talking to my spouse about it, they've been as supportive as they can but it's different from someone who doesn't have an idea of what this feels like"
CPTSD,I've become a monster and I don't know what to do with myself?,"I recently had a revenge fantasy of me fighting kid at school who bullies me and sometimes I want to act on it
. But the problem is I'm 24 years and the bully in question probably doesn't even remember what they did. But unfortunately that's how it's been for me the past few years, nothing but emotional flashbacks and absurdly violent daydreams. I want to stop but I can't, it's like enjoy being sad and angry."
CPTSD,When does it ever end?,"So to summarize itâ€¦.since 2020 I was doing therapy for cptsd, substance abuse etc. (alcohol & cocaine) around December i reconnected with an old middle school friend and weeks after we began dating. By month 3-4 he moved in with me because he was basically sleeping on the couch at his grandmas then i got pregnant anddddd thatâ€™s when hell began. my mood swings were CRAZY and i was severely depressed so i got on meds for the first time. He started smoking and drinking every single day, i ended up losing my car (repo bc broke af), and couldnâ€™t work bc of the pain of my baby pressing down on me inside. To make matters worse he didnâ€™t even have a job too he was always on and off and the environment was toxic AF. Thatâ€™s not even half of what iâ€™ve gone through with this man. At one point i left him bc he got so drunk he put his hand on my neck bc he thought it was funny to scare me, he was throwing shit everywhere in the room where my baby was sleeping, also had to chase him outside.  Now my kid is 2 yrs old and i basically gave him another chance for the third time, and yet again i had to put a pause on my internship (i only need my intern hours to grad out, i started school after when bby was a few months old), lost my car(repo) and iâ€™m broke again. Now iâ€™m leaving him for good, iâ€™m moving back into my familyâ€™s house, my mom is buying me a car cash 3.5K from my uncle, also iâ€™m going to work with her on mornings (cleaning houses) while my â€œacademic leaveâ€ ends. iâ€™m so ready to move on and finally heal from everything. My prev. therapist  made me realize it was a trauma bond, i have low self worth and suck at boundaries.  he reminds me of comfort and chaos just how it was growing up in a abusive household, which is probably why i let him talk me into believing his manipulative words. He just makes me feel so shitty i swear, he makes me feel so shitty for trying to move on and says itâ€™s breaking our family apart. But i know i canâ€™t come back to this anymore, Iâ€™m so fucking exhausted all the time.  i desperately need to be on my own for my kid and myself. I wonâ€™t lie itâ€™s extremely frustrating and difficult. Anytime iâ€™m alone i just burst out crying, i canâ€™t believe i let myself endure this for so long. All this emotional abuse, iâ€™m a fucking mess. 

sorry for the grammar btw lol"
CPTSD,TRY- reparenting by committee,"As a freeze/fight, Iâ€™ve spent enormous energy hiding from or fighting with people- SAFE people who are trying to help.

This is the tricky part about Cptsd. How to trust those who are trustworthy.

As much as I didnâ€™t like to admit it, but to heal a relational wound requires RELATIONAL healing. Only so much cognitive awareness of the problem will do. Action is a necessary step toward healing, and for me, action means interacting with people in a healing way.

Takes guts to trust after one has been abused. But the way out is in. 

Iâ€™m with you, you arenâ€™t alone."
CPTSD,DAE struggle with brain fog and difficulty concentrating?,"I very much feel like Iâ€™m in the â€œshitty partâ€ of therapy right now. My sessions bring out my PTSD symptoms in full force, and itâ€™s making it so hard to think and focus. Itâ€™s impacting my work too. Sometimes I just feel stupid because I sit at my desk in a daze, and I canâ€™t seem to process any information.

CPTSD,Another empty dance card,"Looking forward to another lonely weekend. I did have plans that didnâ€™t work out. And isolation is very triggering - thatâ€™s all I grew up with.

I donâ€™t know how to handle it when Iâ€™m alone for too long.

I want to share adventures, and I donâ€™t have anyone to do that with

(See, my brain is already gearing up to make me miserable)"
CPTSD,The mental health field has failed me.,"I have been to five different therapists and have been actively pursuing therapy since i was 13.

My first therapist only wanted to talk about my romantic and sexual life despite the fact i was 13 and wouldn't change the subject when i tried.

My second therapist brought my parents in and told them about everything I'd said about them.

My third therapist was fine but unempathetic and often ended our sessions early he was helpful in some ways but seemed to think my anxiety was cured by our 11th session.

My fourth therapist flipped out roles and i ended up counseling him on his struggles with his daughter and wife. He ended sessions halfway before they were scheduled to end often and when i sent an email to inquire about talking through my suspicions about sexual abuse in my childhood he ghosted me and never contacted or set up another appointment again.

My fifth and current therapist has been better than the rest but is rigid and conforms to a very by the book curriculum to the point I've found google pages she's quoted when doing my own research after sessions. I've asked to take a more emotion centered or at least less lesson plan-esque approach but have seen no changes.

I've also been to the psych Ward once where me and the other patients were neglected, threatened and mistreated by the staff. Other patients were also able to do some off things without the staff interfering like suggestive comments or bringing female patients to secluded areas without supervision. Its hard to go in the detail on it but it was a very traumatic experience and i have nightmares about being sent back there.

Today i was seeing my current therapist hoping that maybe since i had the courage to bring up some of my childhood trauma for the first time we'd be able to talk about it or idk discuss it some maybe? I was let down again as she began talking about our curriculum and how we'd start doing radical acceptance stuff. I'll give it a shot like everything else but it seems like stoicism bullshit I've done before that failed and lead me here. I decided to do some research and found out she read off a website that was the first search result when googling radical acceptance. I don't expect a therapist not to quote things sometimes but i had hoped since we were following a curriculum that she wouldn't have to Google what she's trying to teach me about. This last sessions just left me wondering if she really is a good therapist or if my standards are just rock bottom. I read her some poetry I'd written which really helps me get my emotions onto the page and responded by telling me I should write about more happy or hopeful subjects.

I feel really discouraged by all of this. I don't know what's left to do to try and recover or process my life. Just accepting it and saying it is what it is, that's what I was doing before and i fell apart I've done it all before I've tried so many different approaches to getting better and managing my struggle and they just seem to fall through Everytime. I just feel so hopeless i really put everything i could into working on myself and into therapy and self improvement and it just doesn't work. I'm still getting worse and worse and worse. I don't know why I still go to session or even do her assignments. The mental health care field has failed me so many times and i don't know what to do."

CPTSD,What can I do?,"I have a friend who has cptsd along with some other metal illness.  We had become pretty close and hung out pretty much daily. Texted most nights and I thought of them as one of my best friends.

I did something that I thought would help them but it turns out I was overstepping a boundary and over texted (triple text kinda thing).    I asked to speak with them about a week later - that was when they first told me I had triggered them and they weren't ready to talk yet.   I have done my best to give them space since I felt like that was what they wanted but now I am second guessing myself.  I really miss this person and I am scared I royally messed up not being a more supportive friend.  I don't know if there is anything I can do to try and make things better between us."
CPTSD,CPTSD + ADHD + ASD (High Functioning),"I grew up with covert narcissistic parents. I cycled often through the usual narcissistic family labels. Mostly either scapegoat or forgotten child. Got diagnosed in the mid 90s with ADHD--and was the ass end of all the dumbass psych fads at the time (hi Ritalin). Grew up religious, so that was often used by the narcissistic parents as a bludgeoning weapon when I'd protest their abuse. These were the parents who would hold up their fingers to naysayers and let said naysayers know they 'never laid a finger on [their] kids'. True, they never beat us physically, but mentally? Emotionally? Financially? Religious abuse? They were not above those things. 

Fast forward to 2008. Started university. Studied art/illustration. Switched majors to music. Almost didn't graduate six years later. Managed it though. 

2012 got married. Both her and I had codependency issues real bad. Didn't realize it at the time. 

Graduated college 2014. Moved to her parents' property 2015, and had our first child end of that year. I don't know how to handle kids because I had no childhood and loud piercing noises triggered intense anxiety in me. The deep self hate only got worse. 

2020, COVID-19 hits. I contract type 2 diabetes. We have our 2nd--a daughter. My brain and state begin to deteriorate rapidly. I develop an overeating disorder (that's when the diabetes hit).

2021 she declares she wants a divorce, we separate, I move out to my folk's place in another state. Custody fights and battles take place. 

End of 2022, I learn (finally) that my parents are covert narcissists, and have been emotionally abusing me my whole life. I escape that December. 

April 2023, ex and I finalize divorce. She sets the court order to being thus: 'child support will be worked out mutually between the coparents'. (Obviously she saw the writing on the wall and knew I was going through hell).

April 2023, hit a low low point. Drive to the nearby mountain range to view something beautiful in the wake of the ugly destruction of my life one last time before putting a 9mm in my skull. By an act of God, or the universe, or whatever, I don't follow through and go to the crisis center. Spend 10 days on suicide watch at the local behavioral health unit. Lose my job, lose my car, lose so much. 

Back at square one. 

Move in with my brother. Tried to keep a job there, but cptsd is ass like that. ADHD makes it no less easier. Get diagnosed with high functioning autism.

Moved to a new location again. Worst mistake ever. Idk what else to do. 

I'm a 19 yo in a 37 yo's body. 

I can't function right."
CPTSD,Anyone tried EMDR?,My therapist suggested EMDR. She is trained in and provides it. I wanted to hear from people who have tried it what their experiences have been. Thanks!
CPTSD,Gratitude Work in Therapy?,"Background: 
I have a diagnosis of CPTSD & BPD.

For context: 
Over the summer, my trauma therapist suggested practicing gratitude. As my homework, I was to reflect upon my day. The objective, was for me to notice and note down what I was grateful for each day instead of focusing on the negatives.

Problem is: 
Growing up, whenever I was disobedient, my mother would reiterate how ungrateful I am after everything she has done for me.

Ever since my therapist suggested gratitude work, I worry she believes Iâ€™m ungrateful, just like my mother does. I mean, why else would she suggest gratitude workâ€¦? 

With that in the back of my mind, I feel hurt and quite down on myself. In fact, I withhold information from her and sugar coat what I do share with her. Last session, she mentioned that I donâ€™t need to sugar coat the topics we discuss together.

Next steps:
Most importantly, I do not intend to speak to her about this. Why? Because iâ€™m embarrassed and do not want my therapist to further believe that I am ungrateful.

ALL feedback, insight and advice welcome:
How can I get over this and become more open with my therapist?


Thank you!"

CPTSD,DAE feel guilty buying things?,"I have always been scared of â€œspending too much moneyâ€. I know it comes from shame that was put onto me by my parents. Over the last few years, Iâ€™ve become more comfortable with buying myself small things or going out for coffee, etc. Iâ€™m learning that my happiness is worth it.
 At the beginning of this year, I decided to invest in a new computer for myself. My old one barely works and is annoying to use. I told myself that it will be worth it. It will help me accomplish some goals this year. I was so excited when I was looking at computers and I chose one that was a good deal. I received it today and somehow the excitement is gone. I am almost scared to open the box. I am worried that it will be wasted on me. Iâ€™m worried that I wonâ€™t actually use the computer or work on the things I planned to work on. I know that I am in completely in control of this. I can and should make time to do the things I want to do, but why is it so hard? I get discouraged so easily. When I hit a roadblock, itâ€™s difficult for me to find a real solution and then I give up. Then I stop using the thing I bought and the money has been â€œwastedâ€. I know these arenâ€™t my own thoughts. When I was a kid,  my parents would always tell me they wouldnâ€™t buy me the toy I wanted because I wouldnâ€™t play with it and it was a waste of money, etc. While I know that it isnâ€™t a waste if it makes me happy, I am still working to find the motivation to use what I buy and learn new things."
CPTSD,Medication,"I've been thinking about this for a while now and I'm really curious about those who take medication, how many are you on?

I feel like I am on a lot of meds, thankfully I don't have any side effects from them. They help a bit, but not enough for me to justify the amount I'm on. I'm currently taking 5 different ones and have 6 bottles because of the dosage of one of them. I've been at a csu for a few days so the staff does my meds, each time I laugh to myself because of how embarrassed I feel for being on so many. If it's someone who hasn't done mine before, they are so unsure about my medication instructions. It can take them up to 5 minutes to prep them, meanwhile the staff who are familiar with me can do it in a minute or so. It's a tad frustrating because I can do it in under a minute but I just watch and try to be patient. I make sure to check before taking them because the first couple days they either added an extra or forgot one. 2 of the ones I'm on drop my blood pressure, so if they get it wrong I'm not gonna have a good time."
CPTSD,Cpstd but can't remember childhood,"Does anyone else experience cpstd symptoms, but can't remember most of their childhood?

At 25 I had the sudden realization that I had a childhood and it was traumatic and abusive. Although I still can't remember it fully, I realized that I experience cpstd. 

My coping strategy was to forget everything, but it feels right under the surface like I could remember if I really tried to. My first conscious memory was on my 12th birthday when my uncle came to live with us. He was my safe person who helped me get through my teen years.

Anyone else know what this is like or how they moved forward? I want to know what happened so I can move forward but I struggle with the thought that it may be too much to handle and it's better that I don't know."
CPTSD,Can a pattern of toxic relationships cause or worsen CPTSD?,"My childhood wasnâ€™t perfect (dad sucked, but not physically or verbally abusive, yelled and criticized a lot but never swore at us) but it was relatively okay compared to other stories I hear about CPTSD. Dealt with mild bullying as a kid. But I feel like everyone and their younger sister deals with these things and turns out okay.

What I think either worsened or solidified my trauma was my romantic relationships. I dated any guy who would have me basically. And each one treated me worse than the last. Belittling me, blindsiding me, silent treatments, gaslighting, leading on, projection, devaluing, using me, coercionâ€¦ again, pretty much everything except physical abuse. My last situationship was the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. I barely made it back from the brink of suicidal ideation. I had a plan. It felt like life wasnâ€™t worth living because Iâ€™m not good enough for anyone to spend their life with me.

Iâ€™m doing better now, but I realized that I never want to feel that way again, no matter what it takes. I have no interest in dating anymore. Part of me is grieving the love I thought Iâ€™d have someday, but I realized that the risk is my life. Even though I know I have childhood stuff going on, these relationships have felt more impactful but it doesnâ€™t feel like a valid reason because everyone goes through heartbreak. Iâ€™m ashamed of how much of my worth Iâ€™ve put into my relationship status. 

I also donâ€™t know how to heal when it feels like not healing is protecting me. Iâ€™m in therapy but itâ€™s not helping. Iâ€™m in a DBT skills class as well. But I feel stuck. The pain is like a shell that keeps me safe, safe and stuck. 

Just hearing that someone else out there has dealt this way before would mean a lot."

CPTSD,i cried of comfort when my boyfriends parents hugged me,"i wasnâ€™t expecting this to come up. my bf (m27) and i (f25) have been together for 2 years, we moved in together and are planning on moving out of state for his job this summer and an opportunity for me to start a new career as my last job was beyond abusive. 

For new years my bf and i flew to stay with his parents and siblings for the holiday. They have such a healthy dynamic, they enjoy and look forward spending time together, they travel, open themselves to knowledge, challenge themselves, include everyone in conversation..

I find myself always hypervigilant for no reason to be because they always show me healthy communication 
in a family dynamic, how to laugh and talk about serious things, intentional greetings and ways of â€œseeingâ€ others. 

As we were leaving for the airport, i hugged each of his parents and the hugs were soâ€¦genuine. There was a squeeze, there was a hold, there was a pause to embrace.

Iâ€™m still getting to know them but iâ€™m so thankful i met my boyfriend. i am so thankful to be included. 

Not that my family is bad or anythingâ€¦but my home was no where emotionally supportive, my mom was chronically ill when i was little, my dad and i ran the household, my dad was a workaholic with an insane temperament and neglected trauma/anxiety, there was rage and yelling everyday, my brother was the go-to trouble maker that also acted like my third parent. I spent christmas with them and cried the entire drive home, i was stuck in a freeze state for days on end, i couldnâ€™t eat, i couldnâ€™t drink water. 

I have put in efforts multiple times to try and communicate with my family. They get defensive, blame me as a child (even though i didnâ€™t have the vocabulary!), go into rage, just say â€œsorryâ€ expecting to just forgive and forget, stumble among their own feelings because they struggle to express from their own neglect and expect me to LOVE spending all this QUALITY time where we sit together in fragmented conversation and even silence way too frequently just to show we â€œlove each otherâ€.

i feel stuck navigating this but iâ€™ve been in therapy every week since i was in elementary school. itâ€™s hard not to blame or shame myself. iâ€™m still learning to trust my bodyâ€™s wisdom."
CPTSD,I am scared of women my age,"Hey,
23m here. I'm living alone for two years now. from the age of 8, I have lived with a very dominant distant mother and two sisters. there was no father. all these years I experienced bullies at school and coping using extreme form of porn. I don't even remember my childhood fully. Fast forward to today, I work out 4 days a week, I quit porn two years ago and have a prominent career ahead, but I am literally scared of women my age. I can talk calmly with anyone who I do not intend to be in a relationship: guys, far older women etc. I have this severe need of being intimate with a woman that is suppressed with huge amount of anxiety at the same time. I have enormous amount of shame surrounding the idea of expressing romantic interest towards someone. I consider myself very self aware, I have to admit that I tried psychotherapy three times and it did not work well. This thing drives me crazy and I really want to figure it out, because the moment I encounter a person of opposite sex my age who also happens to be attractive, it feels like my body just shuts down and I began internally panicking. Any help in this is greatly appreciated, I see that you guys are a lovely community here."
CPTSD,I have an intense fear of failure. Could it be related to the fawning response?,"To be specific, I have no motivation to do anything because I haven't been told what to do or how to do it. 

It started due to my dad. Up until I turned four and abandoned my mom and I, he liked to amuse himself by tricking me. He would tell me to do something, which was usually either something that ended up scaring me or being impossible for me, and I'd cry which would result in him yelling at me to stop crying. 

At first I trusted my dad and figured that what he was doing was supposed to teach me something. I thought that if I could just do what he wanted, it would somehow make me better in some way. I don't remember what made me realize the truth. But when I did it created a betrayal wound that has yet to heal. 

After that point, I all but refused to do anything he asked without getting all of the information first. I didn't trust him anymore. I wouldn't be tricked again. 

Now, as an adult, I feel like I have to research everything before I start any new task. I avoid making choices because there are so many options and variables I can't correct for. I don't have much in the way of agency, and tend to do just the bare minimum. I don't like to have to figure anything out for myself. I can't. 

I want to be told what to do or have someone else do it for me. But, at the same time, I don't like things done for me. Nothing is ever good enough. I want my surroundings, my creations, my interests, etc to mirror me. But nothing ever does. 

Is this normal for someone with the fawn response? Could it be something else?"
CPTSD,Psychological pelvic pain caused by prolonged severe sexual abuse,"POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING 

Hey! This is my first time posting here and I hope this is the right place to post to. Please redirect me if this is not the right subreddit. 

Lately I have been experiencing severe chronic pelvic and vaginal pain. My symptoms include stinging, burning, and itching in my vaginal area and inside my vagina, uterus cramping, constant urge to go pee but not going pee, pain after peeing, constant vaginal feeling of being raped, and losing control of my bladder. This may sound like an infection or uti but I have been to the emergency room, urgent care, obgyn, and primary doctor and they have all found nothing and they have all said itâ€™s psychological. I had expiernced severe prolonged sexual abuse at the ages of 14/15 with my 27 year old drug dealer, I never healed or addressed it because consciously I donâ€™t think itâ€™s trauma. It was in fact severe trauma but I canâ€™t cope or deal with it so I donâ€™t. 

Iâ€™m looking for anyone with a similar story or has expiernced something similar. Tips will help too, to ease the pain. The pain has become unbearable and I am bed ridden. If anyone needs more info feel free to message me and Iâ€™ll explain more. I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can tolerate this."
CPTSD,Have you ever came to the realization that,Your not the problem but society is actually the problem?
CPTSD,Music as a trigger? Hip-hop/rap/spoken word poetry?,"Anyone have this issue with any music?

TLDR: Going to public gyms is difficult, attending outdoor block parties or ""events"" is difficult, and going to bars/clubs has never been an option.

Interestingly, I love lofi, and any ""instrumental beat track"" out there; it's the bars and prose that trigger me...

...maybe the same reason performed spoken-word poetry messes with me, too. Hmm...

...but the combo with the beats sometimes creates an association.

Context:
Granted, I was raised very ""white American boy"", and while I was by no means ""sheltered,"" I was very undiagnosed autistic, with a sh1tty parent who was undiagnosed autistic, and rap/hip-hop just wasn't around me much until middle/high school.

Intellectually speaking, I know it's just because I was a very socially-alienated kid and that's one kind of music that was either outside my bubble, or was listened to loudly by the people who bullied me the most (of all races/ethnicities, actually). Plus the way racial segregation still happens culturally to this day impacts us all.

Anyone else have similar? Or any other genre at all?"
CPTSD,Reliving my father's death even though I hated the b**st**d with all my guts,"Trigger warning : Description of death

Hello, everyone. I hope you all are having a better day than mine!I am here to just vent. Thank you if you read it all the way through to the end. I appreciate you attempting to hear me out.

My father was pretty abusive and my mother negligent. I lived my entire childhood in hell.

My father died when I was 17 in the last year of my high school.I was in my bedroom when it happened. He just got discharged from the hospital.He choked on water in the living room and suddenly collapsed. I was in my bedroom besides the living room napping when it happened.When I woke up, there was chaos all around. But I don't remember any of that.There was a small Buddhist shrine in the living room. He started collapsing on the other side of the room from it.When I woke up, he was in front of the shrine. I suppose he wanted to pray before his life ended.When I woke up, all I could see was him praying and slowly collapsing into a heap onto the floor.I could see him trying desperately to cling onto life. I could see the fear in his eyes. That's all I remember from that day.

Some people told me not to feel guilty but I guess I do in some ways even now because I was the only one nearby. What if I had not taken a nap that day? Would a life have been saved?

Fast forward. Two days later, I am at the funeral procession. Before his body is prepared, I am brought into the back with my mother. It's funny how much the fingers and the feet look weird after people die. His feet were curled up in a way that I can only describe as distinctive to dead people. His eyelids were half-open and his jaw dropped. I still remember seeing his front teeth. But all I could see was the fear in his eyes the moment he died.

It's been more than half a decade. I'm starting to recover from my CPTSD from the abuse. But every time I feel shitty or have a flashback, those two memories come back. Even now, I cannot stop seeing those desperate eyes and the frayed feet. They haunt me.The man was a horrible human being. At one point, I even plotted to kill him myself.(I was 13-14.)I don't know why this haunts me so much.

Last year, I was doing mushrooms with friends and at one point, I looked at my feet and said ""Oh, I feel shroomy and now my feet looks like that of a dead person.""My friends were understandably weirded out and concerned.That's when I realised. When you bring down all the walls that shield my heart and all the weights on my shoulders, these are the things that are still haunting me.

I feel broken beyond repair, my friends. I know this is just the inner critic speaking and that I have made a lot of progress with my trauma but I cannot help feeling this way from time to time.

I am tired of carrying all this on my shoulders. I hope it gets better one day.I wish it gets better for you as well, stranger."
CPTSD,Medical Neglect,"Got injured recently and I waited 2 weeks to get medical care- now told I canâ€™t use my hand at all for a week. I have this voice screaming at me in my head that Iâ€™m pathetic and making it up and being dramatic still, even though my doctor literally just told me I need to not use it. It was my finger that was injured, so that â€œvoiceâ€ (not a literal voice- you know what I mean) keeps saying Iâ€™m an awful person for asking my partner and coworker for more help and being lazy for not using my whole hand and that I just need to push through.

Of course I told my mom and she was super cold. ðŸ™„ Sheâ€™s been doting about my siblings for weeks and is suddenly cold when I need something. Same pattern as when we were kids (weâ€™re all in our 30â€™s now).

Anyway, anyone else that dealt with medical neglect, you arenâ€™t alone."
CPTSD,Left traumatic environment again and feel so tired,"Yesterday I returned to college after about 2.5 weeks of visiting my parents and siblings. Iâ€™m so tired. Last night I fell asleep 6 hours earlier than I have been lately. When I woke up I was upset that I couldnâ€™t keep sleeping. Today Iâ€™ve just been dissociating.
Iâ€™m having trouble making sense of this. Shouldnâ€™t I be feeling better now that Iâ€™m safe again?"
CPTSD,TW - self harm,I had to restart my counter today. 6 or 7 years and down to less than a day. I know I can get to that long again but man does it still hurt. And I want to again but I know it wonâ€™t make things better. Maybe Iâ€™ll go to bed early.
CPTSD,I am fucking terrified for my life,"So long story short I met someone in a group home who I thought was my friend, we got an apartment together and our relationship turned abusive. He assaulted me (grabbed my penis) talked about killing me. I left the apartment. 

Well he ended up going back to the group home, even after that he stalked my social media's, has been seen around my parents house, and I'm pretty sure he's been talking with my stepbrother and convinced him I'm a pedophile. 

He's been saying ""its on sight it's on sight"" 

I'm scared because this person already killed an animal in front of me, choked his ex girlfriend, and played all kind of mind games to blame his abuse on me when we lived together 

He gets out of the group home this summer, and is not allowed at his parents house. As far as I know has no other friends or anything waiting for him. He careies knives abd has a grudge. I'm scared for my life, that he'll either attack me or continue to manipulate things from afar as he has for the past year 

Im also male if that helps.

Edit: by the way I did report him to the mental health clinic we both went to when Ã¬t all first started, they went from ""Yeah we'll handle it don't worry"" to ""no you're just trying to get him in trouble"". After the latter was when he assaulted me and started gaslighting/bragging about how powerful he feels "
CPTSD,Sleep and self sabotage,"The way I self sabotage with sleep is getting ridiculous. I love to sleep and to stay in the bed. I might have to move my alarm further away in the morning or have a sweet treat or something waiting for me so I can get up and eat it in bed. It also doesnâ€™t help that I do the whole revenge procrastination thing and stay up a lot of the time either actually doing something productive or just watching YouTube. I saw someone else talk about how when  they are by themselves they just kind of â€œdeflateâ€ which I relate to a lot.  It really is a habit I need to address/correct this year. I do try to show myself grace because I deal with chronic pain and muscle tension but I guess I also need to start being honest with myself that showing myself grace canâ€™t always be my excuse and I  also need to  have the discipline to stick to a routine so my future self will thank me for it. Anyways iâ€™m going to get up now, wash my face, and go to the grocery store, wash my bed sheets as well. Clean up a little bit and plan for tomorrow. My goal for this year is to really start addressing my self sabotaging behaviours  and this is one of them. Iâ€™ll update by the end of Jan of steps Iâ€™ve taken to correct this.

CPTSD,Ice cold hands and feet when triggered,"Soo, is this a thing with CPTSD? Whenever I'm stressed or triggered or dissociated or when i have emotional flashbacks or fear (soo, alot of the time) my hands and feet get literal ice blocks. I can't really warm them up with the heater or gloves. But thats not all, my whole body gets cold and every thought or just the slightest movement gives me goosebumps. I have a blanket with sleeves and a heating blanket, but nothing can really keep me warm.

I've read that it comes from the body beeing in literal surviving mode and not prioritizing blood flow to hand and feet, could this be true..?

Am I alone with this..? I've never heard someone expiriecing it.."
CPTSD,My dad will be allowing our abuser (my mother) in our house this weekend... Any advice?,"Hi all,

I live with my dad and we are estranged from my mother due to her abuse of both of us.

She is currently in a legal battle with him regarding financials and she will be at our home this weekend to pick up all her old things (This is years after the estrangement)

Despite my insisting, my father didn't manage to arrange the pickup to be elsewhere. It will be at our home. I have a feeling my mother manipulated him and the situation to be this way -- she literally asked if she can come in the house and she has started personally emailing him and calling him (which doesn't feel right -- today I walked outside and he was hanging up after being on the phone with her, and he was startled as if he didn't want me to know)

She is manipulating him as before, and he is still scared of her.  He also says he feels obliged to heed all her wishes because otherwise she may ramp up her legal case and we could end up homeless ( we are on the poverty line as it is ). He is very worried about this and I can understand

I am considering my options for what to do this weekend when my mother comes to our house. Please know that she hates me because I broke free from her; she has some concerning mental problems and could behave unpredictably; and she has actually tried stalking me at this house a couple of times about a year ago (I am hoping to get a restraining order in the future). 

Due to these stalking behaviours, I really don't want my mother to see my room and rummage among my things -- which I sense could happen if I am not here, given my father's inability to stand up to her.

It's also gone through my mind that I could be here at the house and film it all -- do people do that during transfers like this(?) -- but I really don't think I should be present during the transfer. My safety matters most.

I have received extremely helpful advice on this sub before (eternally grateful ðŸ™) and was wondering if you could help me with this...  What do I do while my abuser mother literally comes in my house this weekend, with my (also abused) father being unable to stand up to her?

I think the best thing is to get tf out for the day / a few days, bringing any valuables with me?

(And yes my dad being unable to protect me properly is a recurring theme and arguably abuse in itself. I am working on getting out of here for good, but as you know it's a process and i'm not quite ready yet. Please understand x)

Is there anything else you think I should know for dealing with this situation? Ty x"
CPTSD,Anyone else having job issues?,"I feel like I'm trying so hard to keep a job.  

I used to just shut down at work and deal with whatever came my way. 

Not sure what happened that I ""can't take it anymore"".  I'm improving in that I now put in 2wks notice vs just walking off the job. 

Am I too soft?  Honestly can't tell if I have a real reason to quit these jobs?

CPTSD,I'm not sure if this is normal for a parent to do?,"I just had one of those moments where you suddenly remember something from decades earlier and think ""Hey wait a minute! that was actually really fucked up."" Came here to make sure I'm not overreacting. 

(I'm 30F) When I was a kid and really food-oriented, my dad used to give me hard candy by putting it in his mouth, sucking on it, and passing it from his open mouth to mine by putting them together. (Not sure about this, it's fuzzy, but I think he would use his tongue and push that into my mouth??) This is the only way he'd let me get candy. 

He'd do it at home in front of my mom but not around other people, and my mom declined to do it with me. Sometimes he'd even stop me randomly and give me a candy that he'd been sucking on for a while, without me asking. 

Sooo... This is weird right? Or is it a thing that's uncommon but not unheard of, like parents kissing their kid on the mouth?

Edit for context: He sexually abused me in other, very unambiguous ways. Just want to get some input on if I'm focusing too much on this one thing, that it's more common than I think. 

And also these were typically those wrapped Werther's. "

CPTSD,Went to my first therapy session yesterday and it completely wrecked me.,"Hi everyone, I would like to share my experience of going to my first therapy session yesterday.

After years of pondering if/when I should go to therapy, I decided a couple weeks ago to leave an appointment. That appointment was yesterday. In the beginning, my therapist explained some formalities, insurance stuff etc.. and then finally said ""alright, so what brings you here?"". I had thought about what to answer ever since I left the appointment weeks ago. 

But the SECOND I realized that it was my turn to talk, all my planning flew out the window. In the first sentence I spilled how my parents have abused me throughout all my childhood. And immediately once those words left my mouth, I started BAWLING. I was talking through tears for the entire hour of therapy. I could barely control what I was saying, I was rambling random stuff about my childhood trauma. My therapist handled it great. She gave me a box of tissues and said ""You're apologizing for crying, I'm guessing you see it as something negative. But for me it's part of my profession and I am perfectly fine with it. You don't have to apologize, take your time. You are talking about something horrible that happened to you, it makes perfect sense to cry."" I felt very comfortable crying and explaining my past to her.

Now why does that matter? 

I have never ever once said out loud what happened to me in my childhood. Not once. Not to anybody. Not to myself. Not even to my best friend of 17 years who I would trust with my life. And I was scared and nervous. Because the second I SAID it, it was serious. In that moment, my trauma became REAL. It was not something I carry around in my head anymore, a place that says ""Was it even that bad? Did that really happen to you? Do you remember it correctly? Doesn't it happen to everyone?"". It was not a shameful secret anymore. Now it was out in the open, out there in the world, and known to my therapist, a person that I had just met for the first time in my life.

After the hour of therapy I felt incredibly relieved. But once I got home, I felt... emotional turmoil. I could feel it in my gut. I could feel it in my head. I was still crying 5 hours afterwards. I kept tearing up every hour or so.   Then I also felt regret. Should I really have told her all that? Especially that quickly? Was I weird for doing it that way? What does she thing about me?
I was contemplating if I should even go to the next session. I was wondering if it is even worth it and if it will help. 

I cannot believe simply mentioning my trauma on a superficial level like that wrecked me that hard and sank me like a ship.

But now, 24 hours later, still tearing up for some reason, I know I have to continue doing this. This is the right way forward, even though it's hard to sit there and talk about the things I least wanna talk about, I don't even wanna THINK about. But the answers are burried somewhere in there, where I least want to look.

It is scary, but worth it.

Thank you for reading, and: If I could do it, so can you. Trust me. I am rooting for every single one of us to get better. 

Sending love <3"
CPTSD,Feeling guilt about s*x in RPG,"This is going to sound so stupid, but it just demonstrates to me how deeply C-PTSD seeps into minds.

I play Baldur's Gate 3 (a role-playing game based on DnD) and had a character that I'd made to resemble myself romance my favourite origin character. 

The game showed parts of the intimate scene (not p*rn, not downstairs bits shown) but seeing a character representing me engaging in those things... all the same voices that called me ""wh*re, sl*t, etc"" and the guilt pounced on me just as it did every time I was r*ped as a child.

In my own life, I am not sexually active because the same guilt overrides any possible pleasure that could be derived from it. I hate seeing my breasts, hate myself if anyone perceives me sexually 

NaÃ¯ve of me to assume that a game would be inconsequential. Now I just feel ridiculous and pathetic. 


**spoiler of SA, as my emotions are triggered from previous and repeated SA from between 14-19 yrs. The game did not show SA, just to clarify ðŸ˜…**"
CPTSD,What physical symptoms has CPTSD given you?,"I know that physical symptoms are not clearly triggered by CPTSD, or that this has not yet been proven, but what physical Archilles heels do you have? I was never heard as a child, which has continued into my adult life. As a result, I have had recurring voice problems since childhood and have been unable to speak for weeks at a time. I also pick up every infection. My immune system is pretty down. I've also had SIBO, or at least the symptoms of it, since I was a child. And although I've never had any life-threatening illnesses, I've had the craziest symptoms that doctors couldn't explain."
CPTSD,So how can i fucking change my core beliefs?,Just repeating myself that i love me?
CPTSD,Trust Issues,"My earliest memories involve my parents destroying my self esteem; they broke me down throughout my life and now my opinion of myself is horrible.

Iâ€™ve been with my girlfriend for six months and sheâ€™s a wonderful partner who I can have difficult conversations with. I couldnâ€™t be happier and we really grow from problems that come up in our relationship. We donâ€™t have any huge issues in our relationship, we have disagreements itâ€™s alway due to miscommunication because we have different communication styles; we always come to a common ground and we learn that we think the same but need to learn how to communicate better. Iâ€™m happy to say that weâ€™ve learn and grown a lot in our short time together and I think we are both very happy together.

I have no reason not to trust my girlfriend, she has an abundance of reassurance for me even though she is not naturally a verbal person with her feelings due to her upbringing; I sincerely appreciate her effort to provide reassurance although is not natural to her. She doesnâ€™t hide her phone from me and if I really wanted too, I can ask for her password and go through her phone; however, I never ask her for that because I know thatâ€™s sort of opposite to the concept of trust. 

In a few months she will be going to Las Vegas with her friends to see a concert and see the night life. This makes me sick to my stomach as I literally cannot imagine a scenario where she wonâ€™t cheat on me. 

She has done nothing to make me question her loyalty but 18 years of daily verbal abuse from my parents has demolished my self esteem. Iâ€™m now 27 and have tried healing from reading Pete Walker and listening to Tim Fletcher and Iâ€™m happy to say Iâ€™ve grown tremendously; however I cannot trust my girlfriend who hasnâ€™t even done anything to make me think she would ever cheat on me.

I used to self harm physically for years and Iâ€™m happy to say I havenâ€™t physically hurt myself in years, I feel a strong urge to self harm mentally by breaking up with my girlfriend. I still feel unworthy of love and breaking up with my girlfriend will satisfy the desire to hurt myself; furthermore, breaking up with my girlfriend will eliminate any uncertainty in my relationship. I cannot question her loyalty if we arenâ€™t together in the first place. 

I know logically that breaking up with her is irrational but I have a strong yearning to return to the comfort of self harm and isolation. Being alone hurts, but dealing with the pain I cause myself is familiar and makes me feel like Iâ€™m in control.

Has anyone here experienced something similar and how you overcome these feelings?

Thanks for reading."
CPTSD,I cried for the first time in four years today,"After wanting/trying to cry for almost every day for four years straight and never being able to (except for one time when a football player I didn't care about left a football club I didn't care about which somehow really got to me), I finally cried yesterday.

It took me new antidepressants, a night of no sleep and a parent sitting across from me who didn't acknowledge my wellbeing and was talking about every topic under the sun except for my health (they know that I am struggling). I cried for half an hour, and they didn't hug me, or asked me if I was OK, which put my whole journey into perspective. I don't remember much from my childhood/teenage years but I am suspecting I never got a hug when I needed it.

I was told crying gives relief, but I feel like my nervous system is about to burst, and I think it was maybe better before. I have no energy to cope with this new sensation I'm feeling in my head."
CPTSD,Moving through pain,"I love my new job, but had a random thing where (2) customers started swearing at me- I went into a head space where I don't know what I said back. 

I remember bits and pieces. 

The first customer may have had a point, it was a misunderstanding, but she started calling me a ""B\*tch"" and I lost it.  She left to complain to her husband. 

Right away I had to deal w another customer and was  initially cool headed towards him.  He did the ""I want to get a discount and speak w your manager"" thing.  I gave him a pen to write down his info so I could give it to supervisor who was due in 2hrs.

He threw the pen at me  saying I should have his information--and I went into another ""headspace"".

I said alot of things I barely remember, just stress responses.   Not a black out, but just what ppl would call ""a blind rage"".   When I remember the things I said back, I cringe.

Why did'nt I just stay quiet.  The words just shot out of me. I'm embarrassed. 

I think this job is not for me- I wasn't prepared for how volatile ppl would be.  It's a customer service job- rental cars- so stupid me didn't get the memo about ""taking so much hate"".   

I just didn't do my research.  

I put in 2 wks notice to quit--but feel scared about it all.  I just want a job.  I just need a job.  

Why am I so stupid and what kind of job can I handle?  BTW, I may be dysfunctional at times, but am what you'd call a ""people person"".  I thrive in busy social environments.

What kind of job should I go for?  What kind of training do I need?"
CPTSD,"Feel lost, where do i start?","I feel so triggered into intense flashbacks of shame and guilt beibg around people and have isolated myself my whole life because of it, i developed widespread pain because of relressed emotions so thete's not much i can do in terms of hobbies.. where do i start, how do i do the rewiring.."
CPTSD,Her words on repeat and yet,"When I (f28) was 11 and started puberty, my mother changed. I was still ""a very good, polite and quiet"" girl but taller I guess. She gave me things to clean and cook everyday without explaining how to do it and got really mad when it wasn't good. 
She kept telling me ""I am ashamed of you. You are useless."" On repeat. 
I couln't say anything without her sighing or eye rolling. I couldn't have emotions but she could. 
She cried screaming for a week when I gathered the courage to tell her I found myself an apartment (after she told me to get the f out). 
Today I would give everything to be able to cry in front of someone or to cry in somebody's arms instead of being the one holding everyone and not allowing people to see me in return. Or just to feel like I deserve to be loved and let someone in. 

And yet, how can I think about my mother this way? She gives me fruits when I visit and she pretends like nothing happened. She is the perfect mother that hated me. 
I have a brother, no need to tell you he was a prince. 

I guess I need therapy. 
Thank you for this group. Love you all."
CPTSD,How do I go about getting diagnosed and getting help?,"I believe I have CPTSD or some form of PTSD. I have had lots of repeated trauma throughout my life and lately I have been extremely trigger and have started to lash out. 

My father is a covert narcissist who has caused me repetitive traumas throughout my life. He hasnâ€™t been the only one but as of right now thatâ€™s been whatâ€™s been triggering me so much. He is repeating the cycle. Repeating the same behaviors he did throughout my entire childhood and itâ€™s created a flight or fight response in me that I really donâ€™t know how to deal with. Every time he lashes out or acts out I go into extreme overload and panic. I also get so incredibly angry. Itâ€™s to the point we get into arguments pretty much every single day because of his behavior. 

I really donâ€™t know how to deal with it anymore. Itâ€™s been like this for the past 5 months and it has been incredibly draining. I feel so tense all of the time and struggle sleeping from how bad the anxiety is. Every day I just wait for him to get upset again and itâ€™s the same thing all over again. Itâ€™s draining me and making me into an angry person and I hate it. 

Any advice on how to bring this up to my psychiatrist? I donâ€™t want to seem like Iâ€™m self diagnosing myself but itâ€™s become a real problem. Iâ€™m starting to feel physically sick from all the stress."
CPTSD,Regression/being frozen in time,"Iâ€™m not sure what I want to post here or how to phrase this, but I just wanted to get something out and hopefully connect with others.

I am 26M. I recently got a diagnosis of BPD for the first time (along with major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). Reading about Quiet BPD made so much sense and resonated a lot. I also know I had a trauma happen at 13 that really impacted me and my development, and Iâ€™ve come to learn about my childhood and dysfunctional relationship with my father before that.

I think my default setting, in between periods of more confidence and stability, is to regress to being a teenager fully dependent on his parents, unable to cook or care for himself, unable to keep jobs and sleeping all day, eating junk food and escaping reality through sleep or occasionally movies and tv shows.

I know how important connection is, and I know just a few days ago I was feeling so much more grounded in my true self, as quickly as the regression comes I feel like I have always been like this and will always feel like this, unable to care for myself, unable to keep a job, unable to live. Needing to live in my parents basement, sleep all day, watch tv/be on my phone all night, and just â€˜waitâ€™. 

Although it has been years and a lifetime later now, I donâ€™t live with my parents, but I still donâ€™t know how to figure this life out. 

Anyways, Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m looking for or if Iâ€™m posting in the right spot but I just needed to try to connect with someone. I feel like my sense of autonomy and sense of self was disrupted in a key age of development and I feel frozen in that time. Thanks to anyone who reads this ðŸ’œ"
CPTSD,Old memories of physical abuse as a child are drowning me,"My household was very abusive. Parents loved to be perfect at church and the community, but both would turn into monsters at home. My dad would beat me a lot since I can remember. I have a lot of memories these days about him beating me to feel good about himself. He is a very insecure man. It often was when he made a mistake or something pointed out something he didn't know, he would boil inside in anger that he didn't know everything, and would take it on me.

I'm the eldest (now 44, with a son, and we are NC from my parents), and was recognized as highly gifted. I was bookish, got good grades always, have been succesful academically, I have a doctorate even in something brainy. I think they always knew I was very smart, and my dad really resented that. So many beating was that he felt inadecuate with me, I realize.

We weren't allow to do much at the house. Not go out. Dad dominated the TV.  So I read a lot of books. I loved reading. I read encyclopedias, I read my mom's old university textbooks as a small child, I was just so eager to read whatever I could find. And at some point, he started to hate it. Really hate it. He could come to my room at yell at me for reading too much. It wasn't that I had chores to do or something. It was just he hated that I might be learning.

And later for some reason he would get offended for anything I said, asking if I knew more than him. He would ask me to stand in front of him, while he hit my head and torso from side to side. It would start with open hands, but he would get more enraged. Often he would blame me for getting enraged, saying things like I had to look at him in his eyes while he hit me, or getting angry that I was staring at his eyes while he hit me, that I had to show I was humble and look down. Sometimes he would mix them up. He would often tell me I had to show respect to him, that I had to learn he knows everything. He would also say he was all-knowing and that he was going to teach me he was god. This happened almost weekly, that he felt slighted somehow for his intelligence, and I would have to take it. Sometimes I didn't even say anything, it was something unrelated to me, but he would claim my eyes said it, and he would take it on me.

I seeked helped, but all adults around me told me the usual invalidating stuff: he is doing his best, he does it because he loves me, God has a purpose, have you tried being a better child? Etc, etc. I hadn't thought of many of these beatings for a while, and I feel terrible guilt like I had been invalidating myself.

I decided to go NC because of some horrible things Dad did while I was visiting him, that hurt me professionally dramatically,  affected my income, and through that, my son. He was always very good to him, which felt like he trying to make it up somehow. But when I confronted him that the thing he did not only hurt me, but hurt my salary and him, he said ""It doesn't matter"". A month later he wrote a text that he had already asked for my forgiveness (he didn't), so I should let him talk to his grandson. I blocked him then, and have been hermetically in NC for many months now. It's not hard, because we live abroad.

At first, I thought I didn't mind if son called his grandparents every now and then if he wanted. He is 11, and I felt maybe if I didn't let him, I would be the bad one, or make them the good ones. He didn't show interest in talking to them, which was great. But a week ago, after months of not thinking of them, he talked to his cousin, who mentioned them, and he asked me about them. I changed the subject, he didn't seem so interested anyway, he just had realize how much time he had passed. I know I have to talk to him about it, but I started to feel afraid and guilty.

Afraid and guilty. In part because I know my Parents will pretend to act well and be nice, but they will start using him to send me messages, and eventually, messages with attacks he might not understand, or might make him feel bad. It how they always have been. In part because I worry letting him talk to them is exposing him to their manipulations. But then he does have a VLC relationship with them, and he does like my dad.

I think this inner conflict is what triggered a lot of my old physical abuse memories. I feel overwhelmed by them, and memories of how adults I trusted would invalidate  me and tell me to accept the abuse.

CPTSD,Covert narcisstic father's behaviour meaning,"Covert Narcisstic Fathers are very good at pity playing. 

They never say what they really feel. They say one thing do another. Their actions and words never match up. I have observed a few actions and behaviour of a covert narcisstic father of my friend. His passive aggressive attitude can leave one extremely confused and almost obsessive. Because it looks so harmless but it can mean so much more than the eyes meet. 

Here are some actions of a covert narcisstic dad of my adult friend. Those who might have had a similar experience can share what you feel about it. I will also leave a brief explanation of what my friend felt about the experience. 

1.Covert Father telling his adult son who is trying to move out from the house and go NC : ""Wherever you go, we will always be watching you""

This statement made my friend feel paranoid. However the father claims his intention was that he will be watching over him. 

2.Covert father threw away a lot of personal belongings of his adult son despite him telling not to do so. He threw away gifts from his friends. 

This made my friend so affected as it made him feel disrespected and unimportant.  It also made him feel his father deliberately wanted things that reminded him of his friends to be discarded. 

3. Covert father starting a conversation when adult son was angry despite telling him not to engage with him during that moment.

My friend felt he was being deliberately provoked at a time when he was feeling agitated and the father did it purposely to get a reaction out of him."
CPTSD,"The only person I felt safe with betrayed my trust, it was the last straw","TW: Harassment.

After years of being mistreated and abused since my early childhood, now in my 20s I found a person I feel completely 100% safe with, they get me and I trust them with anything, it's difficult for me to trust and feel safe with someone so they were special, became a parent figure and they're part of my living situation so I see them everyday.

The other night when alone they made a very inappropriate comment that just shattered my heart, it filled me with dread and it's making me rethink out whole relationship, I can't talk about it with anyone, they were the person I trust, they only person I feel safe with and now it's just gone, they left me alone. They KNOW the CSA I suffered, how much I want to kms, how hard it is for me every single day to not kms.

I'm just so mad at them, why did they had to fuck up our whole relationship and throw it down the drain in one sentence.

I've been going through one of the worst moments of my life, seriously considering either suicide or hospitalization for a while and now it just broke my heart even more. I feel unsafe un my home, how I dress, what I do,  I don't wanna be here but have absolutely nowhere else to go. 

I'm gaslighting myself into thinking I misunderstood or It isn't that bad just to cope and make the living situation bearable but I can't, I can't keep going like this this is just too much, it's just the last straw, I feel so betrayed seeing the way they always saw me. I don't have anyone or anywhere left for me, I'm done I'm sorry, I hope they forgive me."
CPTSD,Too many feelings after our normally-good couples therapist swerved wildly out of her lane ._.,"Content note: bad/invalidating therapy experience.

My husband and I have been with the same couples therapist for probably over 5 years. She is a little bit old school, but is somewhat trauma-informed, and came very highly recommended by my psych. 

There have been times when we blurred the line between couples and individual counseling. Part of why we see her is that my cptsd and his go-with-the-flow-ness make it hard for us to address issues head on, so she gives a space to do that, but a lot of things circle back to my triggers. She also pushed hard to be there for me individually when I was between therapists for a few months. (Which I didn't really want, I was intentionally taking a break after 10 years straight of individual therapy, and I don't love her style when working individually - but still, she showed a great deal of care for me )

But something is going on lately. The session before last, she said something insensitive about my relationship with my mother, and I cried. I thought it was a misstep, but at our session yesterday it became really clear that she is projecting something of herself onto my mother. Lots of ""she made mistakes but she loves you"". Lots of insistence that my sending my mom a Christmas card with money is some grand statement about how much I love her and couldn't possibly really want to cut her off - despite me repeating over and over that the card was to keep the peace and kick the problem down the road because I'm not in a place to handle the confrontation right now. 

There was more but I dissociated pretty hard and don't remember most of it. 

That was yesterday. Today I'm having terrible brain fog and am really sad. I'm trying to just be kind to myself and take care of myself. But it's really hard. 

And I think, somewhere that I can't access right now, I'm really angry. We've worked with her so long and she's been legitimately helpful, I don't feel like this is enough to ditch her, and I certainly do not want to play another round if therapist roulette right now. But why would she do that? I know she knows better. I don't understand what happened."
CPTSD,How to deal with shame and questioning my reality when I blow up at my supportive partner?

That was decades ago and I was granted refugee status in the country I live in today.I don't trust anyone. I was raised to be generous, open, and friendly which people during my life have taken as a free pass to screw me over and use me, betray me. Not during the war, I mean after. I know I have anger issues that can flare up at the first hint that someone is taking advantage of me. I can't let it go or forget it. I know that's not ""healthy"" but who else but this community would understand that this is not irrational.

&#x200B;

I'm not going to act like I'm a victim in past relationships because it takes two to tango. But in my past two relationships I broke up with them probably way later than I should have after they cheated on me, stole money from me, physically abused me, destroyed my prized possessions, called the cops on me with false accusations (even got dragged to court then case dismissed). I sure know how to pick them. I also know I wasn't the most perfect partner to them (didn't physically abuse/cheat on them) so not trying to have a pity party.

&#x200B;

1.5 years ago by some fate of the stars I met my current girlfriend and I love her so much that I am writing this post after she gave me a reality check yesterday. Logically, she is the most healthy, safe person I have ever had in my life. She is an open book, she prioritizes me, she communicates clearly, she does things to make me feel loved and seen. She's never raised her voice or done anything to hurt me on purpose. Even when we argue she is composed and never throws personal insults in my face like my exes do. She actually wants to know what I think and feel which is alien to me. She is smart, beautiful, and sensitive to my background. I honestly don't know why she's with a POS like me because in every dimension she is beyond my league. I know everyone is thinking that too.Â  I'm waiting for the red flags or the inevitable shit show to start and it's not happening yet.

&#x200B;

But I can't help but have moments where everything seems fine but my brain screams at me that she is lying to me or hiding something from me. I notice everything to the point it's a curse. I notice when my laptop is not in the same place it was when I left it, when I hear background voices when I call my girlfriend, when I see that the passenger seat of her car has some dirt marks on it like somebody else sat there. I can't be wrong every time. I let these observations fester in my brain until it creates a ball of rage and betrayal because she is obviously looking through my shit, putting me on speaker and letting others laugh at me, or f\*cking someone on the side behind my back and having them ride in her car.Â 

Why? Because that's what all my exes did to me. Because people have looked me in the eyes and said they love me, while they are cheating on me or using me for gain. I know to a random person I sound unhinged. But I can't help notice these things. I also don't want to come off as an abusive control freak so I shut up about these observations and my girlfriend is none the wiser, until inevitably I explode at a random moment and accuse her of spying on me, cheating on me, laughing at me. I'm ashamed to read back the messages I type or the things I say to her.Â 

She acts completely shocked and hurt but I honestly can't tell if she's faking or not. SHe begs me to tell her what exactly she did to make me angry and I feeel so fucking stupid pointing to how my laptop moved or some shit and the more she tries to comfort me and promise she didn't look through my stuff, and ALWAYS has an excuse like she moved it because she was cleaning the living room, I don't know what to believe. IT's the same shit excuses my exes gave me and the logical side of my brain is telling me to believe her but I'm just so suspicious of why she is even with me and then after the dust settles I'm such a coward I can't even talk about it again even if my girlfriend does. I can tell she's hurt and holding onto it and trying to resolve the situation. She tells me that I should be with someone who I Trust and feel safe around, and if she's not giving that then that's not a healthy relationship for either of us.

&#x200B;

Two days ago I blew up again at her for no fucking reason while she was trying to comfort me on the phone because I was triggered and enraged after one of my buddies screwed me over on money I lent. I heard whispering in the back and I knew in my heart she must have someone over and they are listening to the call and laughing at me, I hung up and texted her some vile shit. She messages back shocked saying she was watering her plants and that was probably the background sound, she begged to Facetime me so she can show me nobody is here, she shared her electric door key history to show nobody came in or out, and suddenly now I feel like the crazy abusive boyfriend again.Â She put her foot down and said she is not my exes, that the things we argue about are not actually about things she DID or SAID but about betrayal scenarios that I make up in my brain and refuse to ask her about early on as soon as the insecurity flares or an observation is made. She's right. But I don't know how to stop this cycle. I do see a therapist somewhat regularly since a few months back but I've also had therapists quit on me and actually change careers because they couldn't ""cure"" me or some shit. So what the hell do I do, anybody can relate?

&#x200B;

Â Keep me honest am I being an abusive POS? I fucking hate myself and my girlfriend doesn't deserve me. I don't even know why she hasn't left me yet at this point because this is occurrence #15 of times I've blown up at her for these exact same reasons and I can tell it takes a toll on her. I keep wondering there has to be an ulterior motive why she's with me and it keeps feeding into these bullshit loops in my brain. How the hell do I stop and just be grounded in reality?

Thanks and sorry for the rage paragraphs. Hope everyone here has a great day and appreciate this community."
CPTSD,How will I ever be comfortable around men and children?,"Trigger warning, this post is going to get into SA/child SA. I myself am never uncomfortable around kids. I was a camp counsellor, spent my adolescence babysitting, am currently a teacher, and have spent a LOT of time with kids. I love them. However, whenever Iâ€™m around kids and MEN, I feel like crawling outside of my body Iâ€™m so uncomfortable. I read way too much into a manâ€™s every move. Iâ€™m so on edge & fearful that theyâ€™re attracted to the child. I donâ€™t know how to get over this. I know it stems from my own past and that itâ€™s extremely unfair to paint men as a whole in such a negative light. Yesterday I was spending time with my boyfriend and his best friends daughter (sheâ€™s 5 years old). My boyfriend kept grabbing her, tickling her, putting her on his lap, playing with her hair, etc. I couldnâ€™t even look at him. He at one point went into her bedroom alone with her, and even though it was only for a couple minutes, I could barely breathe. The little girlâ€™s father didnâ€™t bat an eye. Iâ€™m not a mother, but my history/training with kids is that it is NEVER ok to be that touchy with someone elseâ€™s kid unless THE CHILD initiates the touching. He later on said he worries about being seen as a creep, and I said â€œthat didnâ€™t seem to stop you in terms of touching herâ€, And he got defensive and said this is exactly what he means. I really do trust my boyfriend and I want to get over this but I truly donâ€™t know how. Then I worried that I would never be able to trust my own kid with their father. Have any other women felt similarly and worked through it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
CPTSD,Why do people think nagging is helping,"Throw away for obvious reasons

Iâ€™ve been living with the symptoms of what was ultimately diagnosed as cPTSD since I was very young. Compulsive ideation set in when I was just as young. 

I was lucky for a long time, my shambles mess of coping mechanisms helped me keep the desire to self harm away for more years that it ever had a right too. 

Then 2023 happened and holy shit. If you had told me January first that by Halloween I would be homeless and sleeping in my car I would have laughed in your face.

The end of October saw the one final moment of awful that led to homelessness and it fu
lly broke. me my mind saw the opportunity for a quiet exit I made a plan I cleaned up my affairs, no one noticed, right up to the moment one person did. They showed up after I had taken a bunch of pills and begged me to go to a crisis center, I did. After finding out what happened another friend stepped up and offered me a futon in his unfinished basement. Their efforts in those moments meant a lot to me and I decided to try to make things better.

Itâ€™s been a couple months now nothing has really changed anything for me, the people talking to me seem to believe that calling the burner phone they got me every couple days and asking me if I applied for jobs is helping me stay accountable. My dad even texted the friend I am staying with and told him that he shouldnâ€™t feel bad if he ultimately decides to kick me out later because it might be the tough love I need. They donâ€™t understand just how badly barely functional I am any more. 

A friend of a friend had a project I might be able to help with asked me to meet for coffee to talk about it. My environmental triggers used to just make my heart rate go up and my hands shake a little something about the people and the noise I had a full on panic attack and started hyperventilating at the table.

The people who say they want to do â€œanythingâ€ to help donâ€™t actually want to do any of the little things that might actually help me. Calling the behavioral health center I got connected to to make appointments and navigating their phone system seems so simple but is now so hard almost impossible I get so flustered.  Instead of asking me why I havenâ€™t sent out resumes someone could have helped me make sure I actually have the appointments I need to supposedly get help.

All I can think lately in the dark moments is how selfish of them to ask me to prolong my pain but then sit here and judge me as I struggle."
CPTSD,does anyone have any tips to actually do stuff in a day,"my days typically look like me waking up around 9 but then falling back asleep until anywhere from 11-1. even when iâ€™m awake, iâ€™m in bed on my computer watching youtube or scrolling on my phone. if i have work or commitments during the day i canâ€™t get up and go just fine. If i have things i need to do that i canâ€™t procrastinate i have no issue doing them. 

when I dont have structure or any external pressure to do things like getting out of bed, going outside, drinking water, eating food, excercise, cleaning, brushing teeth.. i literally just wonâ€™t do them. it feels so infinitely different and i just shut down and canâ€™t do them. doesnâ€™t help that i never feel fully awake or have ever. when i do end up doing them i feel worlds better. Iâ€™ve kind of discovered that i just donâ€™t really find the things that take effort worth it when itâ€™s just for me and i never have. i know itâ€™s not true but iâ€™ve been in this habit my literal entire life. 

anyways, does anyone have any tips?"
CPTSD,My development got arrested at the mental age of 9 until I was 25. I swear,"This is insane when I think about it, but I know it happened.

I went through something at 9 that was so unbelievably dehumanizing, that it basically erased my existence from earth. 

After that I was never myself again. I just felt I had died at 9. I went through teens and early adulthood like a robot, with pure cognitive compensation and insane willpower, still feeling like a 9 year old. I even travelled a lot. It's crazy.

Then I found someone who helped me. His kindness woke me up. After that, aged 26 I found out I am neurodivergent (autism).

NOW I feel like a fucking teenager. I am almost 27 and I swear I just hit puberty as the neurodivergent self that I am. I cannot work, this is not a joke and it's terrofying. I spend hours on TikTok watching dog videos while I read science books as a teen.

I might die this year but this has been a mindblowing experience"
CPTSD,I'm horrible with kids because I was not able to be one myself. How do I stop feeling insecure over it?,"I am not good with kids whatsoever. I've been told this since I was a kid myself. 

Due to extremely unique circumstances, I was surrounded by adults for pretty much the entirety of my childhood years ( I didn't go to school until fourth/fifth grade) and was always on my best behavior because of this, on top of the fact that I was being abused at home. I didn't get to live my childhood as a child, instead, as an adult in a child's body. 

I have five younger siblings but always treated them as I would a friend/adult(which is all I knew at the time), which prompted my families comments about me being weird around kids. Beyond my younger siblings, there are no young children in my family. It's not that I don't like kids. Kids are great and I really enjoy learning about them. I just don't know how to function around them. I find it hard to operate around anyone really, so it's even harder around beings that are completely foreign to me. 

I don't remember what it was like to be a child, little lone how to operate around one. I get awkward, uncomfortable, annoyed and over-stimulated when I'm around children. I know how to say a kid is cute and that's about it. I took child development courses in college so I'd say I'm pretty well-informed on that but that's about it. I don't know how to hold a baby, I don't know how to talk to toddlers, play with them, get to know them, etc. 

It's become a joke to both my family and even my long-term boyfriend as I've grown. One time, I was offered to hold a really small baby and I felt like I couldn't say no. I was uncomfortable and felt like I was doing it completely wrong. My boyfriend told me he was thinking to himself ""oh god, put it down, put it down"" as it was happening. That made me feel pretty bad about myself even though he assured me that it was just super funny to him. 

Whenever I see women my age with a child, I get really insecure and almost jealous of them. I assume they are all fantastic with children and will be/already are perfect mothers, whereas I assume I will one day be a horrible mother unworthy of her children. Not to mention the generational cycle of abusive mother's in my family.

I really do feel like my 'maternal bone' or whatever it's called was stolen from me as a child. It wasn't something I was born without which makes me not okay with not having it. I'm afraid I'll turn out like my dad, emotionally distant and uninvolved, or worse, my mom. I feel like all odds are stacked against me with parents like that, the fact that I didn't get to spend my childhood being a child, and the fact that I am already uncomfortable around children as it is.

CPTSD,"abusers taught me in regards to religious beliefs that rapists, pedos and abusers are meant to be and serve our world in some, that I should be grateful for them","I was taught abusers and pedos serve me because they make me stronger, they are meant to balance out the good and evil god created, they serve our world in those ways. That I shouldnâ€™t complain so much. I was taught god needs these people as much as he needs soft and good people.

I hate religion."
CPTSD,is this enmeshment or am I losing my mind???,"This whole thing is more of a vent but I am trying to figure out if this is truly enmeshment or me overreacting. Posted this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/19218gr/comment/kh2om9u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/19218gr/comment/kh2om9u/?context=3)

yesterday and someone mentioned this sounds like enmeshment, and I just started looking into it todau  
  
I don't even know where to start or where this might have began, but basically my entire life has been me afraid to do/ask to do ANYTHING because I am so afraid of what my parents might say. This  isn't like I'm doing anything bad btw, say (hypothetical) if I wanted to take singing classes at like 8, I wouldn't have asked because of the fear that they would have either 1. told me no and embarassed me for having that interest or 2. smothered me with the interest and made it unenjoyable. I don't even really know what I mean by smothering, I almost mean like make them ""too proud"" ??? Like somehow me in this example, singing, would have become their identity too in a way, and I couldn't just do it just to do it?  
  
I was homeschooled by my mother k - 12, and graduated a year early. I was never really good at any community sports so I held myself to a higher degree because I was done early. Then it somehow turned into ""I'm done early and it makes my parents look good because of this."" And ever since it's been that way with everything. I have literally expressed out loud that I do stuff for them because I don't want to make them feel bad/look bad in front of other people, even if it's compromising my wants and needs. For example, my mother runs a youth group with kids I absolutely cannot stand. It is a CHORE beyond belief to be there. I have gone for 9 years and, while recently she has been saying ""you know, you can quit if you want (bc I am 18)"" its never not accompanied with ""How would God feel if you didn't go hangout with these people"" or ""I really wish you would start your own youth group since that was the whole point of me starting this one."" I do ignore her when she says to start my own, but the guilt tripping and knowing how bad it will make her look if her own daughter doesn't come to these events is what keeps me going to them. I know that sounds basic but its just been a LOT of these little things piling up to the point where I do almost whatever she says.  
  
In addition, we are WAY too close. Everywhere I go my parents have to be with me (if not both, my mom at least). Both my parents think they are so incredible for being close with me and my sibling but its to the point where its way too far. Neither of them will go out to eat unless me and my sibling go with them, if my sibling gets out of it, I still go. Shopping is the same way, its all considered ""family time"" as if my whole life hasn't been ""family time"". Comments made from my mother about how ""My daughter just gets me"" and ""My daughter is my best friend"" and so on. All the drama between my parents my mother has vented and complained to me about. I have heard about their sex life in a very strange attempt to give me sex ed. In my last relationship, she had to know every detail of what I did sexually with my ex and STILL ASKS YEARS LATER instead of just leaving it as ""yep she did sexual stuff"". I've asked people I've known if their parents do this regarding sex and they just looked at me dumbfounded, mainly because now I know this does not happen with other people, and mothers do not WANT to know every minute detail to every sexual encounter their kids have ever had.  
  
I know a lot of people will probably wonder why I cave and give her this info, and I've realized exactly where it came from. So in the youth group my mom started (religious) there is a lesson we go over on not lying to your parents which I have no problem with IF its a legitimate thing you have to lie about. There was a period of time where I was cheating on math homework, and after hearing the lesson I came clean to my mom and told her I was sorry. Fair enough. However, at some point it turned into this thing about consistently ""keeping a clear conscience."" Every night turned into me feeling so horrible about every ""bad thought"" I had in my head and I would just tell her everything because i was pressured into doing so. One time I was like 10 and I said ""bitch"" IN MY MIND, not even OUT LOUD, and i had to build up so much courage to ""come clean"" to her about this ""horrible thought"" I had in my head. When I did come up with the courage I was crying to her for quite a bit because I felt so bad about it. I was pretty badly sexually abused for a long period of my life so the intrusive thoughts I have are not normal and I knew should not be shared, but I felt so guilty (???) about not sharing them with her, so I would. this went on for YEARS and I cannot explain the amount of distress I felt NOT telling my mom something that I didn't want or even need to share with her. The problem was, when I would finally get a grip and stop sharing, she would guilt trip with the ""oh you used to be so open with me and you would share every thought you have! You stopped for some reason??? Why??"" The consensus was that CLEARLY, to her, I was hiding something, when no, not every thought I have, you have to know about. But I didn't want her to think I was hiding anything, so the cycle would continue. Literally the definition of 0 boundaries. This went on for a good 4 - 5 years.  
  
I know lying is wrong, and it's not like I want to lie to my mom, but when it comes to a lot of things (ex. sex) I cannot force myself to not share. I don't need to say ""nope never have done anything sexual"" but at the same time every minute detail does not need to be played out as if she was in the room watching.  
  
You will see in my other super long post that it is kind of expected that I don't leave the house. So what's weird is that, for my own wants and needs, I will lie about those, simply because what I say is what they want to hear. That I never want leave the house, I only want to spend time with them, I am happiest with them. Everything I do down to the clothes I wear and stuff I buy is with their permission. Every clothes shopping trip my mom has to come, to make sure she likes the clothes and are appropriate enough for her. Now though I have become codependent on shopping w her because I don't know what clothes fit, she picks them out. And my worst nightmare is coming home with clothes that she won't let me wear because it always turns into ""What kind of girl did I raise to think its okay to wear THAT (the ""that"" in question being a top that comes half a cm over my shorts so my skin shows). If not that, it's also I just have no identity, so I also have to pick out clothes SHE thinks are cute, not me. It's just never ending. I can't tell if this is enmeshment though or me just being a pushover..? Sorry for the embarassingly long post."
CPTSD,My body shuts down,"Have you experienced trying to face the abuse and remember ..but when you do your body freezes, your mind starts yelling to make it stop.
If I ignore it and just give in..my eyes literally start to roll back and close. I feel like I'm dying. I have wondered if I just let my body go if I'd pass out..or if i would remember it all. I want to just let it happen but feeling like it will kill you is scary...

I used to question if what I remember was true but lately I've remembered more and my body/mind throws me into this shut down response."
CPTSD,I just remembered a memory from years ago,"That one of my friends sent an information tweet like ""large amount of apple seeds can kill a person"" to our group chat. And my other friend replied like ""oh nice to know that, we can use it if we have to kill ourselves in one point"". And I was extremely suicidal at that time. I've never said them I was suicidal but I know they knew that I was extremely sad. Guys am i just paranoid here???"
CPTSD,Imaginal reliving??,"Has anyone ever done imaginal reliving with their therapist? 

I have just started therapy and amongst other things from my childhood there is one specific event that my therapist and I agree caused a lot of issues. She talked about trying a technique called Imaginal reliving when Iâ€™m ready. It sounds strange and Iâ€™ve never heard of it before, but basically you role play or describe your memory as if itâ€™s happening to you in the present obviously itâ€™s very triggering, but thatâ€™s the point to unpack and to apparently recover more memory. 
Sheâ€™s made it clear that itâ€™s my choice, I donâ€™t have to do it. 
Can anyone tell me about their experiences? Did it help ?"
CPTSD,A victory,From reading on this sub yesterday I had a dramatic realization that I feel is really going to help me get well. I discovered I am in a chronic long term freeze response that is continually reinforced by my constant ruminating of the many situations that gave me CPTSD. I have spent thousands of hours trying to understand what happened to me and the domino effect those things had on my life. But still thinking about stuff  over and over is actually re traumatizing myself and keeping  me in this freeze response. It causes severe anxiety and panic even when I am safe. So  I am going to stop thinking about all the horrible stuff and people. I don't need to figure out any more situations. Im tired of remembering over and over like a time loop. I need to stop that. I need cleanse and purify my mind from those people and allow new good things to fill it. Nothing is easy but understanding chronic freeze response is very helpful. I suppose we can be stuck in any of our trauma responses.
CPTSD,dissociation question,"am i crazy or am i the only one who doesnâ€™t mind depersonalization/derealization/dissociation â€¦ i feel like everyone describes it as distressing but my brain has always used it as an escape when being in my body was unsafe, so i typically do not mind it. i get so uncomfortable when therapists ask me â€œwhere i feel emotions in my bodyâ€ because i feel such a disconnect from my corporeal being!! i donâ€™t want to be reminded my body and brain are attached! having a physical form has always been unsafe for me so i dont WANT to ground myself. or am i not actually experiencing dissociationâ€”is it SUPPOSED to alarm me?"
CPTSD,rage,"Getting very triggered at some subreddits and their child abuse apologia. Victims of abuse asking for help and getting hit with apologia. Horrifying world where so many are abused constantly everywhere and no way to stop it. I constantly feel helpless despair. Pervasive pro-abuse social norms everywhere. When will we get out of this hell we've been stuck in for thousands of years. Can't stand it. Struggle to do things because everything is hard and also being bombarded with trauma responses all the time and also while the trauma is still ongoing. Society is disgusting and traumatizing and I hate it here. Feel so alone, most people don't fucking get it. What is the meaning of ""post-"" when abuse culture, patriarchy, capitalism etc are still here, the trauma can't be over until they are over."
CPTSD,â€œItâ€™s your responsibility to save/fix yourself.â€,"Dear God, shut the fuck up. Either that or actually help me, instead of wasting your breath and my time on these stupid, nonsensical platitudes that serve nothing but your silly, pathetic ego. 

You think this isnâ€™t common sense? I know this. Let me just be wishful for once. Let me actually so much as fantasise about someone wanting to love, protect, and nurture me. 

People are so fucking annoying.

CPTSD,Help: Anxiety triggered: therapist suggested to Look into bi weekly sessions,"I  have been in weekly therapy for 2 years now . 2023 was  the worst year of my life. I have upped my Zoloft dosis before christmas and finally feel better. After 3 weeks of holidays and therape break  my therapist asked me how I felt These last 3 weeks without therapy. It Was ok and then she suggested to see of I could handle therapy sessions longer apart. And I know she means well she wants me to see that I am capable on my own. But it triggered anxiety and following  thoughts:
- i am a loser because I havent made it after 2 years!
- i am not where I wanna be
- she wants to get rid of me.
- I just started to feel better, what if it all comes all back?
- feeling abandoned

Please share your experience with therapy."
CPTSD,How does diagnosis work?,"I started seeing a counselor for depression and anxiety. He has been using CPT with me, but any time I've directly asked him for a diagnosis (or if the presenting diagnoses from 2016 are still correct) he will redirect the conversation. He's had me take several assessments and questionnaires about PTSD, all of which came back with high scores supporting the diagnosis, but anytime I look at the session notes or coding, I still only see anxiety. Does anyone have any insight for this? I understand CPTSD is not in the DSMV, but would there be a PTSD diagnosis?"
CPTSD,"There seems to be this idea that if you had an abusive father, people will automatically believe you, but if it's your mother, people won't...","That's really upsetting. People don't like to believe abusers exists, whether they're male or female. No one automatically assumes men are dangerous and women aren't. That's not how it works. 

I'm gonna say something, forgive me, it's going to be a bit blunt.... Abuse isn't a gendered issue. There's no such thing as one gender being believed more than another, or one abuser being more believable than another.

I feel like there's this trend, pretty much everywhere online, of trying to put women and men against each other. It's not cool, it's not right, it's not okay. 

We're all survivors here. We've all survived abuse, from abusers. Their gender doesn't seperate us. I promise, if you're a woman, there are male survivors that you can learn from, talk to, get support from. And if you're a man, there are female survivors you can learn from, talk to, get support from.

I wish this gender war insanity would stop. I really do ðŸ˜©"
CPTSD,Night terrors as an adult,"I've been having night terrors on and off for a while over the last 10 years. I am now 28 and had one a few nights ago, I had a friend who was staying over with me. Whats frustrating is about 5 years ago, the last time she was with me, I also had night terrors. I seem to have them at least once a month, but sometimes I have them multiple times a week and then go through periods of not many (at least, not that I remember). Usually I wake up screaming and the screaming wakes me up. Sometimes I'm screaming because of something I see in the room, such as infestation of bugs or random figures in the room, but then snap out of it and realize there's nothing there. Sometimes the visual is so vivid though and I've had times when my siblings would come running into the room to see what's going on, and I tell them what I see and they see nothing and thats when I realize its just a night terror. I live on my own now though and I fear at this point that I'm just an annoyance to my neighbors.

Does anyone else still experience night terrors as an adult? I seem to experience them similarly to the way a child would, so I am annoyed I still experience them, especially with people around. I dont know what to do about it and it has been going on for so long. Whenever I start screaming, I genuinely can't control myself. I don't live in a traumatic environment anymore, but I did up until last summer."
CPTSD,Question about sexual connections *trigger warning*,"I do not have sexual trauma that i know of, however my therapist mentioned thoughts (that are normal to me) that potentially could have been caused my something..

â€¢meeting someone and instantly thinking about having sex with them
â€¢wanting to be r*ped by older men that i know
â€¢wanting to have sex with male family members who are nice to me 
â€¢looking at young girls and having intrusive thoughts about them being sexually harmed 
â€¢even as a young child, was interested in specifically male genitalia 
â€¢some connections = sex
â€¢having an intense primal fear of men as a young child and sometimes even now.

My past trauma is specifically from my very mentally ill mother and explosive step dad. I have 0 memory and never even thought of it as a possibility. Are these normal cptsd/BPD thoughts?"
CPTSD,How to stop bracing for the next trauma?!?!,"Been in a funk for a few days now and itâ€™s been disappointing as I had come into the new year telling myself I was going to focus on creating a wonderful life for myself and focus on my blessings.

Well the last few days I spiraled.

I feel like everything is great right now and after years and years and years of allowing extremely harmful people around me, Iâ€™ve become pretty discerning and lowkey. I feel like Iâ€™ve done tremendous amount of work on myself and I was optimistic that since my inner world has changed, my outer experiences will reflect that.

Unfortunately, I tend to forget that I still have CPTSD which has never stopped haunting me. 

I spiraled because life has never been SO BEAUTIFUL and instead of being able to stay present for a consistent period of time, Iâ€™m just bracing myself for the next trauma OR watching my back.

No matter how much genuine love and support Iâ€™ve shown others in the past, what I got in return had been certain people trying to destroy me. 

So now that my life is so peaceful and private, I have this fear at any moment something is going to go wrong.

I broke down tonight. I went to shower for a good cry and then continued my cry on the sofa as I had a 1:1 with sky daddy.

Iâ€™m exhausted. Trauma after trauma since birth. Took ages to realize what traits I had that were allowing a lot of shit in my life, took ages to work on those things, took ages to realize Iâ€™m highly empathetic and need to be extremely discerning as I tend to attract abusers, users, etc. Healing has been an incredibly long journey and every time I take many leaps forward, I hate myself for feeling pulled backward into unhealthy patterns.

I just wonder with all the love and compassion Iâ€™ve given out into the world, when can I expect to receive it back? Or is being an â€œempathâ€ in this world just supposed to be our job here, to be a light for all these leeches to prey on.

Gave so much of my loving energy to others in my 20s, who pours into us? Yeah I can pour into myself but I have loads of anxiety and paranoia that I struggle with all the time, waiting for shit to go wrong. Who is there to support us when we need a â€œlightâ€ in our lives? Empaths are carrying the world on our backs man and itâ€™s exhausting. Just once I wish I had someone in my corner when shit felt really heavy to hold me and tell me everything was gonna be ok and Iâ€™m safe. Iâ€™ve always been the cheerleader for others. Itâ€™s sad that I canâ€™t really think of anyone in my life that I can talk to about my struggles."

I met a guy on my floor and we just clicked really well and he liked the same movies as me and we would walk together and make each other laugh like buddies even though we both had girlfriends. 
I was ashamed, disgusted, and embarrassed by myself, my experience with rape and mundane abuse. I felt radioactive, like anything I touched would decay in my presence, stripped of structural stability. I waited 9 years to find this guy again so I could figure it out and come out proud and not dysphoric. At 28 I feel hopeful, integrated, and far safer than before I did all the work to find that within myself. 
I was so happy about this I got atypical antipsychotic meds because I always worry itâ€™s empirically not been as nice as I expect it to be. I think a healthy relationship is just about being loving in your actions and words and never turning on your chosen family because theyâ€™ve been vetted by the hypervigilant parts of us and can be trusted. 
Iâ€™ve been suffering a long time and Iâ€™m not letting it stop me anymore I guess."
CPTSD,moving with others or alone: what felt best while healing?,"after moving out and going no contact with my parents, i have continued to move many times in the past couple of years due to school or work. iâ€™m coming up on another move and the overwhelm and confused decision making from years of abuse is back. 

most recently moved from my house at school to live with a friend and her family. this brought back a lot of things i struggled with at home with my parents. iâ€™ve fallen into a constant state of anxiety, worrying about things like leaving my room, cooking in the kitchen, showering etc. (they are very wonderful people, itâ€™s just me struggling being in someone elseâ€™s space). 

i have two options when i move again and i keep getting so hung up on which will feel better for me. i currently live relatively close to some friends and family and my first option isnâ€™t much further away. the only problem i see is that i would be living alone. i still have a lot of my trauma to work through and while i can very much see that having the space to do that would be helpful, i feel so overwhelmingly alone sometimes. 

my other option is to stay with family, but itâ€™s almost two hours away from where i am now and a good hour+ from my job. my family there is sweet and supportive and i think could help to heal some of my parental wounds. i just get worried about not being close to the rest of my support system, putting more strain on my already-falling-apart car and maybe continuing the cycle of fear in someone elseâ€™s home. 

i guess my question with this is what would you do? or what have you done in your own journey in relation to moving? how did you manage and make it feel better?"
CPTSD,I am exhausted,"I can't do this over and over again.
So much things to heal, there's not enough me left in this body to endure all that...im weak, not strong like that. Im tired.

I implode...felt everything and then nothing. But the slight gush of air hurts my skin, i can feel it stabbing into my bones.

Im really weak, not saying this as a self pity statement, i am drained.

I'm all alone and i can't not be alone, I'll mess things up because of how actually desperate i am. I'm so tired I can't sleep.

There's no helping me, I need to restart. 
But im still young."
CPTSD,CPTSD from medical trauma?,"Experiences of medical trauma can lead to symptoms associated with CPTSD. Procedures, surgeries, or challenging medical situations can trigger feelings of fear, helplessness, or a loss of control, contributing to symptoms like hypervigilance, anxiety, or flashbacks.   
Seeking support from mental health professionals familiar with trauma could be beneficial in addressing and managing these symptoms. Have you or anyone you know faced this? "
CPTSD,My boyfriend's household is abusive and neglectful and it's fucking me up,"Trigger warning: physical/verbal child abuse.

It's weighing on me so badly, how sad I am for him. How sad I am that he still lives with his parents, still has to go back to them every day. They beat their kids. They scream at them. Call them names. Curse them out. They expect their kids to run the household. Do all the chores, keep things running, take care of their baby brother, shut up, don't complain, if you've got a problem with it get a job and get out.

And I've witnessed half this shit myself. My trauma responses are fawning and freezing and even if they weren't, speaking up to abusive parents only ever makes things worse. So you can imagine how utterly fucking useless I feel when I'm listening to his younger sister get cussed out, or watching his mom hit his younger brother's knuckles with a spatula, or watching *him* defend himself from his mom trying to fight him. In front of me. And I just have to stay out of it. Or, god forbid, pretend this is totally fine and normal and I'm unfazed, when in reality I'm fighting back tears.

I am so, so sad. Because I know he can't think too hard about how shitty of a situation it really is or it'll start feeling a lot shittier too, so I can't tell him the full extent of how horrible his parents are. I can't tell him how awful I feel when I hold him close and I run my hands over his back and I wonder how many times he's been beaten there. I can't tell him I hate that bruises don't show on his dark skin because then I never know how bad it gets, how many marks are hidden. I can't tell him that every time I see a belt or hear the buckle jingle I think about how he's been beaten with that before. And when I tell him a small portion of how sad it makes me, he asks ""why?"" and I hate, hate, hate that I know that feeling all too well. Because the full question is ""why do you care? Why does it matter if I'm hurt? Does it really matter?"" And I've felt that same way so many times thanks to my emotionally neglectful parents and I *hate* that he does too, because his parents have taught him that being hit is okay.

Taking him home every day feels like I'm sending him to prison. I am walking him directly to his abusers. To be yelled at and threatened and hit and parentified. And I have no fucking choice but to allow him to be subjected to this, and he has no fucking choice but to accept it and do what he's told.

I am so, so, so fucking sad."
CPTSD,Parent guilt,"Feeling guilty that I would be perfectly happy to never see or talk to my parents again. 

Iâ€™m also feeling angry that I feel guilty about this, because I wanted to be close to them when I was a kid but they would either ignore me or be emotionally abusive.

They missed their chance at a close relationship with me, so now I should feel guilty? Itâ€™s my fault?

I live very far away from them and avoid calling them, but talking on the phone yesterday put me in a bad place for most of the rest of the day. When I donâ€™t talk to them for weeks I feel great emotionally, other than guilt for being a bad child that doesnâ€™t call. 

Just wanted to rant and throw this out there in case anyone can relate."
CPTSD,The guilt trips don't phase me,"I shared a little victory last month about work, today I share another. 


My direct supervisor seems to have challenges with *supervising* effectively. I was being chewed out, albeit kindly and maybe gently, but chewed out regardless. Dead end job, number life style, you can guess. I felt my face drain of color in the start of the conversation and the guilt wash over me, the little panicked voice screaming ""*What now?!?*"".

The go to seems to be guilt trips though. So this conversation ended being very short and grey rocked on my side (woo!) while the other party seemed to try to ""hammer in the point"". 


A younger self would have cried. Now? I really don't care. I'm sitting here and thinking how hilarious that everyone at this place can be so delightfully delusional that they're anything *but* a number."
CPTSD,It feels like there is no escape,"I can't move out.  I can't do it.  I can't get the money, the plan, the connections, the strength, the courage.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I will forever be trapped in a home where I must obey every command or be beaten/verbally abused.  They used to sexually abuse me when I was younger.  I hate my parents.  I hate them.  There is no way out of this.  There is no way out.  I feel like I've lost"
CPTSD,Healing is not an upward curve,"Healing has never been an upward curve for me. There is so much conditioning rooted in my brain and it almost feels like impossible on some days to break the patterns. Journaling helps. Not just to be able to rant, to keep a specific track of how reactions/feelings are changing day by day. If the resistance to change is high, that means the conditioning is super strong as well."
CPTSD,tips for making sleeping in the bathroom more comfortable?,"i'm not gonna get into it but for safety reasons i need to sleep in the bathroom today. i have a towel and my phone and that's it. i can tough through it, but there's a chance i might need to do this for another night after this. any tips for comfort or general wellbeing?"
CPTSD,does anyone else have a premenstrual problems/ disorder?,"i'm embarrassed of my period, it's been a subject of shame. it's embarrassing to talk about with my doctors/ psychiatrist but i think i have premenstrual dysphoric disorder and it *feeds* off my trauma."
CPTSD,My Journey Through Abuse and Discovering Healthy Relationships,"Hey everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a significant part of my journey that has been both transformative and challenging. I'm a 25-year-old woman who has walked a path marked by enduring a lifetime of abuse from various individuals, ranging from those I held closest to my heart to people I barely knew. It's a journey that's left indelible imprints on my life, shaping my choices and perspectives in ways I'm only recently coming to understand.

For the longest time, the true toll this abuse took on my body and mind eluded me. There were moments when I found myself grappling with chronic illnesses and unexplained health issues, leaving me feeling inexplicably unwell. It took me a while to connect the dots, but I began to realize that these physical challenges were intricately tied to the intense stress and trauma resulting from the abuse I endured. The emotional scars ran deep, but the physical manifestations were a stark reminder of the turmoil within.

Moreover, this trauma had a profound impact on my emotional and psychological well-being. Accepting love, kindness, or help from others became an arduous task. The feeling of unworthiness and undeservingness was overpowering, leading me to retreat and isolate myself. It became difficult to fathom why anyone would want to extend care or support to someone like me. This struggle with accepting love and care made me withdraw further, unintentionally pushing away those who genuinely cared about me. I found myself caught in a vicious cycle of feeling undeserving and then feeling guilty for not being able to reciprocate or express gratitude adequately.

Additionally, in an attempt to protect myself from the abuse, I often made choices that degraded the quality of my life. It was a downhill journey where I consistently opted for what seemed like the least damaging choices at the time, only to realize later that they compounded into a series of detrimental decisions.

This realization, while empowering in understanding the root cause of certain behaviors, was also saddening. It highlighted the depth to which past trauma had impacted my sense of self-worth, self-prioritization, and ability to accept love and care from others.

Since abuse became my normalcy, I unknowingly welcomed and even sought out abusive people into my life until the damaging effects became apparent. I found myself overly stunned and in awe of healthy individuals and environments, having lived in a hellish existence for far too long. It felt beyond luxury, almost heavenly, encountering healthy relationships and environments. Questions flooded my mind: How can people live this way? How can they communicate gently and resolve conflicts healthily? How can they have healthy problems?

It's been a journey of discovering the stark contrast between the unhealthy environment I was accustomed to and the possibility of healthy relationships and interactions. As I've ventured into my healing journey and prioritized self-care and self-discovery, I've begun to understand that healthy environments are not a rarity but a necessity for my well-being.

Sharing this part of my journey is not only a means of reflection but also an opportunity to connect with others who might relate to these experiences or have insights to share.

Thank you all for your support, understanding, and the willingness to share your wisdom."
CPTSD,Health and Constantly Sick,"Does anyone else find they are always sick?  Is there any relation between CPTSD and bad health?  I am always sick.  Colds, sinus issues, stomach bugs.  I can stay home for weeks and not have anything to do with anyone with any symptoms and I end up sick.  I have no immune system, never have."
CPTSD,Im tired all the time,Iâ€™m constantly ready to just lay down and block the world out. Iâ€™m tired all the time and everything feels overwhelming. How do you guys manage to keep up with everyday life. What has helped you from self sabotaging or procrastination. What tricks do you have for getting and keeping energy to function?
CPTSD,The financial inaccessibility of housing traps people in abuse and I will never stop being angry about it,"I've posted and commented about this here before but still, I regularly need like.. some kind of catharsis for this because it seems like now that I'm housed im supposed to just be ""fine now"". Cool, not like I run on fear or anything. Not like the fear of losing my housing again comes screaming back whenever i make the tiniest mistake at my job, the thing that enables me to have the ""privelege"" of housing. And of course, I *don't* have to worry about complete mental breakdowns every time I have to move (which is yearly due to rising rents) because it feels like my home is being ripped away from me again and again. Good thing that I don't have to deal with any of that at all, because. Gee. Wow. That would suck!

For context, I'm coming from a US perspective. Housing is inaccessible in a lot of other places too though. (It's just that I don't know enough about how it is in other parts of the world to be justified in talking about them.)

Right. So I'm angry. I'm always angry about this. Between financial abuse, the aftereffects (and compounding) of trauma, and some shit economic circumstances, I've been pretty poor for the last decade or so, which means I'm also very familiar with housing insecurity. I was also shelter homeless in 2022 and car+couchsurfing homeless at some point in the 2010s. There are different tiers of homelessness and the fact that I was able to get out at all speaks to the fact that I was on a higher ""tier"" (ie. I literally just had more luck) than those who couldn't. And hey, isn't that fucked up? Super fucked up!

A lot of abusers tell you that you're not worthy of food or housing or compassion or support. The fact that housing is commodified and homeless people are completely dehumanized just doubles down on that. I want to shake the entire thing and scream about how much that's just compounding the trauma of being told and shown and believing that you, a human being, are not worthy of a safe, quiet place to sleep. Jesus christ. I remember when I was in the shelter and trying so hard not to internalize that me being homeless meant there was something *wrong* with me, because I was surrounded by it and that, oh, how had I fucked up so badly as to lose my housing? (Whoops, sorry I had to escape my abusive father with no money!! Totally my bad)

Imagine if housing was not behind a paywall. Imagine how many people's lives that would change. I fucking just think about it sometimes and I feel sick to my stomach. Imagine if we had *some* kind of thing that would get people out of abusive situations without thrusting them into the abandonment hell of homelessness. I mean, fuck, imagine if we just... didn't dehumanize people for not having homes. But people get stuck with shitty landlords who know that they have power over someone's whole fucking world, people get stuck in dangerous relationships and with family members who hurt then.

And I'm not saying that housing is the only thing keeping people trapped in abuse. It's not. But its a big fucking barrier nonetheless. I'd say about 80-90% of the people in that shelter I was in had a history of some kind of relational abuse. At least. It wasn't a DV shelter. Isn't it funny how that works out? You're low on options for housing (and this can be for a whole host of reasons) and all your options are bad, so you have to stay in the bad option for longer than you would ever choose to otherwise. I'm just.

I hate it. I'm so tired of hearing my coworkers talk about homeless people and I'm so tired of being afraid that it'll happen to me again because I know how this shit becomes chronic. Familial poverty+financial poverty. Both of those together puts you in a vulnerable place. God fucking forbid you have any kind of disability.

Not everyone can rely on their family as a safe source of housing. Actually, a lot of people can't! And yet, is there any other option that isn't ""have enough money""? No?

Fuck, man. I'm just so angry."
CPTSD,Avoiding things you enjoy,"Does anyone else seem to avoid things that they might enjoy?

Recently, I downloaded a game  that I thought I'd like, but it took me almost a month to get myself to play it. Turns out that the game is great and I look forward to unwinding with it every night. I don't understand why I'd deprive myself of even trying something out that could be fun.

I've done this since I was a kid. Does anyone else find themselves doing this?"
CPTSD,What would you do if you want to find help but no one believes you?,"Hey all. I've recovered from a lot of my cptsd, but some things just continue to linger in my life.

Most of us come from a troubled background. Maybe even a troubled childhood. 

I come from some deeply troubling BS that I wish I was hallucinating, but I retained mountains of emails, text messages, and WhatsApp to prove I'm not being delusional. (e.g. some people don't believe me when I say I experienced X with a certain person. Well, I have an archive of emails to prove to you that happened.) 

Nowadays, I spend my free time just trying to learn more about what I'm experiencing. I won't name them... people have been calling me crazy. 

What do you do when you just want to find help but people start calling you crazy? 

I'm thinking just keep moving on and looking for help, but maybe I have to hide even more of my past so that nothing comes of it.

(I was in some troubling issues with certain people at an organization/company. I don't tell anyone b/c I don't want any of it to turn into a lawsuit) "
CPTSD,Calling me by my name has my anxiety spike like crazy,"Any time I have been called by name in the past, it's for bad things. Usually I imagine my mother saying it in that disapproving tone. Always meant I fucked up or she wanted me to do something. I honestly can't remember a time in my past someone said my name for a good reason or in a cheerful way. Now any time I hear it, the dread kicks in.

Oh no, what have I done now? They're mad at me, aren't they? Oh fuck, something terrible is about to happen to me.

The result is rather dramatic. Nowadays, someone will call me and my head *snaps* straight toward them. My eyes get huge. I can't help looking *terrified.*

This REALLY throws people off. Wish I could stop, but it's practically instinct by now. :/"
CPTSD,Just finally understanding that my CPTSD led to my marriage breaking down. It was me.,"It's been a really rough week. I had a session with my new counselor last week (been seeing her about three months) as I navigate separating from my husband of 10 years. It was sudden - this summer I just literally left and said I can't do this anymore.

Since then I show up to therapy each time and my question is ""What the hell happened to me?""

This week, my therapist said, I think your husband's substance use is important to consider.

And bam. A lightbulb went off.

I just got my diagnosis of CPTSD recently, and I was able to put the pieces together. For the bulk of our marriage, my husband was my rock. Safe. Calm. Loving. No substance use (weed, alcohol) for either of us as we both didn't like it.

And after growing up in a home with a violent alcoholic father who also smoked weed my husband was a refuge.

During covid, he started smoking weed, and it creeped me out. That's the best way I can describe how I felt. His eyes would change, his tone of voice would change, and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Now, I don't have an issue with weed - for other people. But for me, I now understand it was involved in my trauma, and having my safe person alter their headspace triggered me so hard.

I told him I felt uncomfortable and asked him to stop. To try therapy. To figure out why he was using to cope. He said he would get rid of it, but then I found his stash the next week. It was the first time in our life together he had lied to me.

I kept telling myself it was okay. It was legal. Other people did it, so why did I have such a problem with it? But my diagnosis and my history now allows me to see that his using triggered me.

It kept on, until this summer when we had a fight that just brought me back to the place I was when I was a kid, with all the anger and crying and pleading.

And a few days later I left.

I couldn't connect the dots. But the year he was using consistently retraumatized me. And I coped by flighting - as I always had before. I ran away.

&#x200B;

And it's taken me six months of being away from my home, six months of being villainized by the people I love, to realize that my fucking trauma (and I am talking serious repeated trauma at the hands of my dad all the way through college and meeting my husband) ruined my life.

I wrote my husband a letter to try and explain my actions. And I met with my mother in law to talk to her to.

She was so angry and told me to stop being a victim. That I am always the victim and her precious son did nothing wrong.

""I believe you,"" she said about my trauma when I explained to her. ""I believe you"" she said when I explained CPTSD. And it made me so angry because if I had said I had cancer, would she say ""I believe you""? Or would she say ""Oh my God, what's the treatment plan? What's the prognosis?""

It just feels impossible to explain to people how the trauma we experienced throughout our lives can manifest in ways that don't make sense to the outside world. How we've learned to cope in ways that don't align with the ""normal"" world. Disproportionate to the situation when looked at through the lens of ""normal"" responses.

Of course when my safe person began resembling the man who traumatized me, I acted in a response that was intense. No one could understand why - not even ME. Until therapy helped me connect the dots.

I don't know why I am writing this. Mostly just to say it's been incredibly hard to watch my life fall apart because I am a messed up person from things that happened to me that I had no control over.

I've worked for years in therapy to try and heal. I thought I had done a good job. But no one had given me the diagnosis in all that work. And I just thought ""Oh, I had a messed up childhood. But that was then and this is now.""

No. The body remembers. It remembers and it will fuck your shit up.

So that's my story. I feel like I'm not worth anything anymore. Like I am damaged beyond repair and I have ruined my life because of this stupid bullshit that I don't think I'll ever get better from.

I hate myself today. And I am angry at the world. And at people who don't understand what it's like to grow up afraid, beaten, emotionally terrorized, and in constant anguish. That I should just stop ""being the victim.""

Believe me, I really wish I could.

Edit: I would just like to add that the responses to this post have been a lifeline for me today. Each one, even the ones that have me confronting uncomfortable things about myself. But the love and ... the understanding ... is something I've never felt in my life. I have a group of people now. When I have always just felt so alone and weird and not like everyone else. So thank you for hearing me, and for all of the things you've shared. I don't post online because I always delete and feel stupid. But I am glad I did today. It's saving my life.

CPTSD,"Need advice: Close friend's/roommate's happiness is driving me to resent her, and I can't stand being around her anymore.","Hello, I'm fairly new to reddit and an overall first-time poster, and I'm not entirely sure this is the right format for this subreddit, but I think you guys might be able to give me the most insightful feedback. For context I'm 21f and friend is 23f.

I moved in with a fairly good friend of mine back in September after many years of living alone, mainly so it would be financially easier on us both to split expenses, but also because I thought living with another person might be good for me. I got diagnosed with CPTSD a couple weeks before Christmas, though initially my previous therapist suspected something in the realm of personality disorders (BPD and the likes). I informed my friend of this fact before we decided to move in together, as I have a tendency to self-isolate and struggle to regulate my emotions (like many of us do). It didn't deter her, and we've generally had a good start, with some bumps in the road here and there. I care for her very deeply, and she was one of the few people I could imagine actually living with.

Last year was probably the most difficult year of my life so far, and without going into detail it entailed a lot of triggering of old trauma and creating new trauma. Basically, a lot of bad shit happened and I was a total wreck until August/September. My friend/roommate knows some of my history, enough to explain why I might act the way I do sometimes, and knows very well what 2023 was like for me.

Despite us being in completely different places right now, I am truly happy for her that things in her life are going well, that she seems to be genuinely happy and in a good spot. She got a boyfriend recently who seems to be a great guy, she has friends and is going to school, doing something she enjoys. I feels like she keeps a lot of her personal life private from me, which is a little hurtful but completely in her right, but it also feels like she only wants to engage in conversations that are ""positive"" in nature. I feel like she isn't interested in really hearing about my day when she asks, because the times I've admitted I'm not doing so good, she doesn't really say anything other than ""oh"" and moves on to do something else until a different, ""positive"" topic comes up.

I feel really stupid for saying this, but it feels like the only thing she cares about is her own wants, needs and feelings, and that I'm ruining her ""vibe"" by not also having a good time like she is. This was upsetting but manageable for some time.

 (As a sidenote, some time ago she started preaching the idea that everyone should just mind their own business and not get invovled with what other people are doing, to a somewhat extreme extent (like that other countries should not get invovled in other countries' conflicts). Maybe she is trying to practice what she preaches? But then I don't understand how caring about your close friend is butting into their business?)

I did grow a little resentful, and that feeling intensified tenfold after my father put me through another trauma over Christmas break. I was out of the country when it happened, and I was able to keep it together for a few days because I had to face him and the rest of my family, but after coming home I feel like any progress I made this autumn is completely gone. 

I hinted to the fact that something had happened while I was away relating to my father,  but because it was New Years Eve and we didn't have much time before going out I kept it very brief, but she never asked me about it again. Now that I'm home I feel so hollow and angry and devastated on the inside, and being around her and seeing how good she has it is destroying me. I'm so envious of how easily she got out of her struggles, how quickly it happened, how she is able to bounce back from terrible things so easily. How seemingly my life is a constant downward spiral, while hers was a bump in the road with bountiful rewards on the other side? I'm so hurt that she doesn't see me, that she doesn't seem to care about anything else than her happy life. If the situation was flipped, I would at least have tried to help in some way, ask if she wants to hang out, ask her if she wants to talk, but when I've needed her she isn't really there.

I know it's not her fault that my life is what it is, and her losing all the good things wouldn't make my life any better, but god, I'm so fucking angry at her and I'm even more ashamed of that anger. It got to the point where seeing her makes my stomach feel like it's being torn apart, and in an effort to not take out that anger on her in a destructive way (yell, say hurtful things), I've shut her out completely. Whenever she is home I can't even form a sentence, I can't bring myself to even try to pretend that I'm fine, but by going cold I did exactly what I didn't want to do and taken that anger out on her anyway, just in a different format. She has asked me if I'm fine and if she's done something, and I said yes and no respectively, because how do I even begin to even attempt to explain why I'm cold and quiet all of a sudden? How am I supposed to say that hearing her say ""Ah, things are just so wonderful right now!"" feels like direct mockery and insult of my situation? I can't bring myself to beg someone to care about me again. I also feel like I can't be vulnerable right now, in any way.

I'm torn between feeling like wanting her to care enough to ask and offer emotional support is embarassing and needy and not my place, and wanting it so badly from just SOMEONE, especially someone who knows I'm struggling. I have literally no idea what I'm ""allowed"" to ask for in a friendship, and it's not her job to comfort me, and I feel like a total asshole and idiot for wanting it. Am I completely fucking broken for feeling that way? I feel like my brain is going to implode if I try to figure this out on my own any longer. I've spent nearly a week now trying to figure out what the hell to do and I have come up with nothing. Is she a bad friend? Am I a bad friend? Am I crazy?

I don't even know what I'm angry about at this point, I'm just angry when I see her or think about the situation. She has been avoiding being home the last few days, which is understandable, but it also just makes me angrier. 

If anyone has any insight or advice or literally anything at all I would be insanely grateful. I'm at a complete loss."

Over the past two months , Iâ€™ve been really struggling with severe C- PTSD symptoms and of course not making progress in therapy . We are all familiar with Anna Runkle . Given that her stuff is far more out of reach , I wanted to see how accessible â€œ Over coming PTSD â€œ was . 

I went to their website , signed up for a day to schedule a consultation. Thereâ€™s a video at the end of the sign up process . I watched it . The next day I waited for the phone call around noon as thatâ€™s when I scheduled it . No one called . I signed up for another time and waited again . The apt had been canceled with out my knowledge ege until receiving an automated cancellation email by the owners . 

I started to receive emails from the husband , Brad . Of course all automated. They were mostly about how I was feeling , any way I can support you , how are your symptoms , ect . 

Basically, Iâ€™m not impressed . There was no communication. The emails made me feel uncomfortable. They were extremely intense , emotional emails that triggered me . I of course unsubscribed and blocked Brads emails, because they were still coming through after unsubscribing. I feel like they are another scam .

 It feels more geared towards people with PTSD , even though Amy and Brad say they can â€œ cure â€œ  CPTSD . Neither are of course in the mental health field . They both claim they have CPTSD and have cured each other . Along , with people in their community . 

It was a weird experience and Iâ€™m trusting my gut on it . I believe their intentions are mostly , good and I hope they really do help some people . I hope they are not making profit off other peoples misery . We are easy targets for hope to rid ourselves of this vile thing .  

If anyone would like to share their experience, please feel free .

EDIT : I was cleaning out my spam folder and found and email from Brad saying "" I'm sorry , but you don't meet out qualifications at this time . Please, refer to my Youtube Channel and Podcast on all the tools, ect "" . I'm going to say it's because I can't generate income for them .I found a few more of his emails and they were your usual , ""Wow ! This client cured there 30 year long PTSD in 30 days ! Obviously , this wont work for everyone , but HE DID IT AND SO CAN YOU ! "", Bullshit .  I'm not surprised , but I am saddened that they are part of the problem, rather the solution and have given into greed like so many people out there . I wish people like this could get banned from making content ad filtered out . I just hate this profit over helping people mentality that is killing people for no good reason . This is why so many of us stop trusting , live short lives, and stop connecting . Fuq you Amy and Brad . Fuq you ."
CPTSD,other people grrrr >:(,"tired of
- being drawn to caregiver relationships where i give and give and get nothing

- getting dysregulated over little stupid moments where people i donâ€™t even care about(!!!) treat me disrespectfully or ignore me. like why tf am i having a flashback bc of jenna from accounting like go away

- never being able to tell if a potential
friend is toxic or not bc everyoneâ€™s a little toxic (but my aunt will spot it a mile away from 1 secondhand story)

- needing to rally 6 people for advice on every slightly stressful social situation bc i donâ€™t trust myself

- being so bad at texting back and keeping up relationships bc itâ€™s stressful!!! but it seems so natural/easy for everyone else 

- needing validationnnn. if brad hates animated tv shows and â€œall them kids with adhdâ€ why do i care that he doesnâ€™t tell me iâ€™m great. like the category of things he doesnâ€™t like is probably a good category to be in.

TIRED."
CPTSD,How many of you have a love fantasy?,"Like you will meet someone, form a strong connection with that person; that connection will take away all the misery and then it's happily ever after?"
CPTSD,How tf do I forgive my bullies?,"More like ""abusers"" but anyway, I have never recovered from the tragic loss of my childhood after daily torment for 10 years. No amount of therapy will help. So I have to try what I haven't before, and to forgive them. But how? How can I forgive a girl who punched me just because she thought my pale skin is ugly? (Yes really, she was the typical fake-tan addicted Bri'ish girl), or the guy who laughed about groping me, even after confronting him about it, or how do I forgive everyone who gaslit me and failed to protect me out of pure laziness? I just don't know how to relieve this pain. Death really feels like the only way I'll no longer be hurt."
CPTSD,Went mad at my manager,"I have a good job, it should be simple and relatively nice with intelligent people around me, but I struggle.

I am bored a lot, I feel hopeless and helpless a lot. It's really only alleviated by nice interactions where I learn things and people are pleased to show me.

However, my boss really rubs me up the wrong way. She's the same age as me, 40s, so no spring chickens both. However, she takes a superior attitude over me and corrects my work (and others) pedantically. It's her way or the highway. Now this would be normal and fine, but she speaks to me like I am an idiot. I have just as much experience in the job as she does, she is just a little miss perfect about it whereas I can handle a little slop if we get the right results. This causes friction as I get sick of being corrected by her. So, she spoke out rudely to me in two meetings, and I snapped. I asked to speak to her on a call, in the presence of two of her trusted colleagues and I told her. I told her I was sick of being talked down to and corrected, instead of helped and instructed. She suddenly got all upset and asked why I was attacking her. So I guess she doesn't realise that she's speaking to people the way she does. She also doesn't seem to realise that things don't have to be regimental and disciplinarian to get things done. Anyway, it's turned into a big incident, I was upset, she was upset, and I was reported to HR. The ""investigation"" is on-going, but I know the other two on the call will throw me under the bus for her. One of them has taken already up her role of questioning me as hard as possible. I hate people, I hate work, I hate stupidity."
CPTSD,Can our partners have low confidence or is the relationship doomed?,"Hey everyone,

I entered my first relationship a few months ago, pretty late in my life (I'm 30). I thought I was ready but it turned out kissing is triggering, touching is triggering, and I didn't really think ahead on how to show affection when you avoid touch. So I'm dumbly sitting in this relationship wondering why she's staying. 

But I refused to go down this rabbit hole, so I thought I would trust that she knows what she's doing and she would break up if I do make her feel unappreciated and unhappy.

It turns out I was wrong, I think. She does feel unloved and doesn't trust that I like her at all, so I asked her to tell me what would make her feel loved that I could do. She avoided the question once, telling me she didn't know. So I insisted and told her I'd wait for her answer. And then she recited a few things I did that she liked. But that doesn't answer my question, because if I really did things right then she wouldn't feel this way. So basically, there's nothing I can do? 

She told me she had low confidence and I fear that it's just deeply incompatible with my own issues.

I don't know... I want to hope but I just don't know what to do."
CPTSD,"I'm terrified of teenagers due to bullying, it was getting better then something happened","TRIGGER WARNING: emotional Abuse

I grew up in a tiny village with no high school. The school I went to had very few kids so I didn't have many friends, and the friends I did have moved to the city to attend high school. I was forced to go to high school in the nearest village where my abusive parent was a teacher. He taught my class for a couple of years, which I remember as the worst years of my life.

I was bullied because I arrived with no friends and no former classmates, plus my abuser being our teacher. The kids would hide my school bag, laugh at me when I was asked a question by a teacher in class, would always be picked last in PE, hit me and push me in the corridors. I had a personal bully, she would mock me and pull at my hair in PE when nobody was looking. I did get some revenge on her later on.

The first year I tried telling my mother what was happening. I wasn't aware I was being bullied because I normalised it since I had an abuser at home and thought I just deserved it. I told her while crying that I was depressed, the kids weren't treating me nicely, and that I wanted to switch schools. Her answer was: ""I hated school too, the kids also treated me poorly, I cried every day because of it. I'm sorry, you just have to pull through."" And that was the end of it. I accepted it because my mother was never supportive, never protected me from my abuser, in fact she taught me to be abused, so I was used to her treason. 

I told my abusive parent later in life when I was aware he was an abuser. He laughed in my face and gaslight the fuck out of me saying it wasn't that bad and my memory was playing tricks on me. Joke's on him, not only was he a TERRIBLE parent but also a terrible teacher. His daughter had been bullied right under his nose. 

After much therapy I was getting better in regards to my fear of teenagers, but then something happened a few weeks ago. I was on a walk in a park with a new friend and we passed a group of +15 teenage boys. We had avoided them previously because in my country big teenage male groups are on the rise and more cases of rape and crimes by them are being reported. But we couldn't avoid the group again so we went past them with the biggest distance possible. As I was walking past them I noticed something warm and wet land on my bare arm. I instantly froze without looking at it and continued walking as if nothing until I got to a bin 50 meters from the incident. I got a tissue out to whipe it off and that's when I looked at it. I don't know if it was saliva or cum. The ammount of it makes me think the latter. When I started cleaning it, I heard the group instantly laughing. I didn't look back. I don't know what it was, since it's common for people to spit where I live and it could have been an accident. I don't know if they were laughing at me since I didn't look back. 

Whatever it was and whatever happened, I got triggered again. I know I'm never going to let my guard down around teenagers again. This sucks, since avoiding teenagers and being alert on the streets in broad daylight is so bad for ptsd. "
CPTSD,Divorced parents kids confused,"My parents got a divorce when I was 7. 
I live with my dad and grandparents due to all the abuse my mom put our whole family through. 
Growing up I never understood why she had to leave. My memory was and still is very patchy. But sometimes she would come back to terrorize our house and I slowly started to understand why she had to go. Physically abusive and manipulative with her words. I received a lot of â€œI love yousâ€ from my mom but she would get really mad at us kids or punch my dad, grandma, or grandpa. She would convince me that dad was the bad guy. I barely remember all the things she did but I do know that I grew up walking on egg shells developed anxiety and depression and other things that I struggle to this day with. She cuts off contact with us due to not wanting to be found. But I do know her Facebook page. She was recently hospitalized from a stroke. 
I donâ€™t even remember what her voice sounds like. I always found it hard to accept the fact that I never had a mom. I would try to find mother figures in other older women in my life. But a lot of them hurt me and let me down. I just stopped caring. But sometimes I think about my mom. I wonder where she is. Or what sheâ€™s doing. Or what my life wouldâ€™ve been if she was mentally stable. I miss her. I hate her. I wish she couldâ€™ve been there for me. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m confused. Iâ€™m numb, sad, and angry. I hate that I canâ€™t remember the things that happened in my childhood. I wish I could just genuinely hate her for all the things she put us through but I canâ€™t even remember. It hurts because it gives me hope she can change when she clearly cannot. Is this something that we go through as divorced parents kids? Is this just a me thing?"
CPTSD,The way I feel is ridiculous.,"I dont understand it, and I dont know how to stop it. 


I'm lonely and want friends - but I don't want anyone near me or speaking to me. 


I want a hug & someone to listen to my annoying rambling crying - but I don't want to be touched and I don't want anyone to know how shitty I feel. 


I want someone to say hey let's go for a coffee and do something! - but I don't want to go for a coffee or do anything. 


I desperately want all these things but I don't want them. I cant win with myself?? What is that??"
CPTSD,Non-Traumatic Flashbacks,"Iâ€™m not entirely sure what to call them, but sometimes, I start thinking of a memory, and before I know it, Iâ€™m almost watching it happen like a movie in my mind. I can stop dead in my tracks and just stand and give a thousand yard stare and look like Iâ€™m completely spaced out, but I donâ€™t even register what Iâ€™m physically looking at; all I can see is the memory Iâ€™m thinking about. These memories are extremely vivid, but Iâ€™m still in control; I know that itâ€™s just a memory, and I could stop these memories midway through in my head if I want to. It does really feel like Iâ€™m taking a brief step out of reality for a moment, so it might be a form of dissociation. A lot of times, it just feels like Iâ€™m vividly dwelling on past experiences. If I had to wager a guess, I think the experiences I dwell on have some sort of emotional potency; they can be good, bad, sad, embarrassing, etc. Iâ€™m just curious if this is some sort of commonality under some area of the CPTSD umbrella. When I have a really bad moment, like where I did something utterly stupid or mortifying, I absolutely will not be able to stop replaying the events in my mind; remembering the sights, the sounds, the people involved, those things are stuck in my head. Maybe I just have a very episodic memory; maybe I just have an introspective mind, but I have a lot of other CPTSD symptoms as well, so it doesnâ€™t seem totally unreasonable to think these things might be related.

Anyone else here do this too?"
CPTSD,are these red flags ?,"I've met a dude online who lives in a different country. At first I found talking to him enjoyable. But then little things came up that made me doubt him

basically, he seems to be lovebombin g me or having way too much enthusiasm for our '''friendship''''' considering he has only known me for about 2 weeks. he will randomly says ''oh, you know you will be always able to count on me-foreverr'' ''i will be there for you-always''. he seems to expect me to talk to me every day. he knows im extremely busy but if i dont answer 1 day he will say stuff that seem like passive aggressive but easy to deny ''oh im sorry, you dont have time for me'' ''oh, you are just using me to improve your german''. idk i feel weirded out and like its giving me a lot of unnecessary guilt (im a fawn type).                     i also have to add he started out telling me a lie that he almost immediately apologized for and there is a lot of humble bragging going on.

CPTSD,I'm so tired of sleepless nights,"I had an assessment today. I wanted to tell the guy an important part of my history that wasn't covered in the last part. A factor into why it's so difficult for me to work... and I knew the consequences of talking about it. Nightmares. Crying. Unable to sleep at all. Images as soon as I close my eyes. Flipping from being shaken but fine to sobbing uncontrollably. This happens every time I tell someone about what happened... but it was so important to me that it was written down, and now I'm stuck facing the consequences of it.


I'm just so tired about the fact that talking about something makes everything so much worse for days."
CPTSD,How did you realize that you suffered from C-PTSD respectively trauma?,"That's a thought that just came to my mind. I mean there are many key moments through which you realize why you are the way you are and why you react to situations the way you do. For example, I found out about my trauma through therapy, even though I originally sought therapeutic help for another problem. I'm just interested in how you ""found out."""
CPTSD,How do you deal with sex and sexual shame?,"Okay, I'm just slowly dipping my toe in figuring out what's going on with my own sexual shame.  So I'm using this space to practice articulated where I'm at but I'm also looking to hear about other people's stories and experiences processing sex and shame around sexuality.

I'm just realizing how much sexual shame I carry.  I put a trigger warning on this because of the sexual abuse I experienced as a kid (mostly limited to sexually inappropriate comments throughout my childhood by my dad, and groping by my dad, inappropriate objectification by my dad and step-dad, and growing up in a religion that was super restrictive around sex).

I am totally out of touch with who I am or what I want sexually.  I find that my way of managing this is to attempt to micro-manage my partner's sexuality and also to always say yes to whatever he wants, whenever he wants it.  Goodness, as I write this, I realize that of course I want to manage his sexuality and needs - because I have no boundaries (and no idea of where my boundaries are) and so I have to control him so that he doesn't ask me for something I can't or don't want to manage.  

Maybe, what I'm trying to figure out... but am so far from getting to... is allowing and accepting my sexual boundaries and welcoming my sexual desires.  How in the fuck do you do that?  I have literally no idea and am terrified of any sexual preferences or desires I have.

&#x200B;"
CPTSD,Of course heâ€™s like this," Just had an appointment with my psych. Told him I was thinking of deferring my study to focus on myself for a bit (context: Iâ€™m in my final year and I hate this programme but I dont wanna drop out since it would be a waste of the first 4 years I tried to tough it out). Dr said I can try some new meds for a few weeks and then think about it because itâ€™s helped his past patients who thought of quitting their jobs. So I agreed. 

 My dad usually goes in after me to talk about what I discussed with my psych. It probably sounds weird but this is the compromise we decided on since he pays for my meds. Idk what he heard or if he misunderstood my Dr but he wont shut up about how I dont care about his happiness and heâ€™s threatening to drive into other cars n shit. All because he think I want to drop out(?). He thinks im not trying hard enough to work on myself but I know that all he really wants is for me to shut up about my feeling and be a good daughter. And once again my mom doesnt say a word."
CPTSD,Angry,"20 years spent in pain, only in the last two have I been able to lift myself out of a constant dissociative state and lose 50lbs healthily by my own will power, in school and doing right by myself. Now the anger and sadness is back, why did I have to go through it? Why arenâ€™t you dead for what you did to me? Why do I have to live under the same roof as you. I feel like Iâ€™m going to go crazy holding it in. Not every night now. But tonight Iâ€™m in physical pain. So the pain in my heart is bubbling up I think."
CPTSD,How to tell someone Iâ€™m newly seeing my body has a fear response to sexual intimacyâ€¦.,"Hello, Iâ€™ve (F) started seeing someone (also F) for the last month or so and we started making out recently which was really nice. I want to keep making out and see where it goes because I really like her. When seeing someone new and sexual intimacy is being led up to, my body starts shaking and convulsing when Iâ€™m making out with someone because of my SA history. 

SA happened in 2010-2011 and itâ€™s happened with all three sexual partners Iâ€™ve had since. I hate having to even explain it and let people know so I usually donâ€™t and just push through but then I end up feeling violated. So I want to tell this person so she can be aware and so I can feel safe. But I am really scared because last time I told this to a girl I was seeing she freaked out thinking I was a fragile baby and ended things. 

Anyone ever had to do this before? I am scared itâ€™ll make me seem really damaged and fragile and she wonâ€™t want to see me anymore. She knows Iâ€™ve had some history of assault as Iâ€™ve mentioned being in an abusive relo as a teen."
CPTSD,Anybody else triggered by having to deal with the landlord?,"I recently moved to an â€œaffordableâ€ apartment. The landlord seemed pretty nice, but red flags started right away.  A recent double murder in the parking lot at my last apartment meant that in this housing market anywhere safer was better. 

We made some flaky deals that meant I was doing things tenants donâ€™t do. Painting ,cleaning long neglected common areas, washing windows â€¦ I was stuck in fawn mode, so I was bending over backwards to try and get the landlord to like me I guess. 

Couple months later,  trying to get him to schedule a bug treatment itâ€™s going HORRIBLY.  Today it evolved into a shouting match. It was a dumpster fire. He decides that okay now is the time, if Iâ€™m going to be such a pain in the ass about it. Like okay, but thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been asking you to do since November and suddenly youâ€™re inspired. 
He got all aggressive saying something about my dog is going to die and itâ€™s going to be his fault, then opened my kitchen cupboard and started to spray roach spray on my food?  I yelled at him not to  spray poison on my food he yelled at me to empty the cupboard.  We did not have an appointment for this treatment, or I would have prepared. 

Itâ€™s fucking bad. I did what I was told, thank you dysfunctional brain. Then I grabbed my keys and my dog and literally ran out the door. I didnâ€™t even get a jacket and itâ€™s wintertime where I live.   We sent a flurry of stupid texts. I resorted to almost begging him to be reasonable. The shame is killing me. I was only asking him to do the things he either said he would do or Is legally obligated to do. 

He triggered me. I didnâ€™t have a panic attack, small miracle. I am so triggered that I have been shaking for more than 12 hours and I canâ€™t even eat or  drink water.   I came home but itâ€™s after three in the morning and Iâ€™m sitting on the couch with all the lights on, my shoes on and ready to bolt.  I canâ€™t come down. Iâ€™ve tried my self soothing stuff but I think I broke something. Itâ€™s just been too much for too long. 

Also he just comes banging on the door when heâ€™s in the building which seemed okay until this happened and now I donâ€™t feel safe. I want to abandon everything and run. I have done that multiple times, when I was an abused child I ran away. When I was an abused wife I ran away. When I got abducted from my home I didnâ€™t run away but I wound up abandoning it and putting all my things in storage for literally a couple years while I put myself back together. So much of my trauma revolves around having a safe home.

So Iâ€™m wondering if others are like this? Itâ€™s not my landlordâ€™s fault that all this other shit happened to me. And now I think I ruined this new living situation. Fuck. Now what?"
CPTSD,"i don't know if my boyfriend believes me, and its making me doubt my experiences","as a disclaimer, my boyfriend is incredible. he's hands down the best person i have ever met. he is sweet, considerate, patient, funny, unconditionally loving, and everything else you could ever possibly want in a partner. i have been in an abusive relationship, and this is not that. everyday, i fear that he is like those who have hurt me, but he's not. I think that fear alone drives the majority of my anxious thoughts about him.

Basically, the first few times I cried in front of my boyfriend, he was the sweetest thing in the world. He was incredibly gentle and understanding, and listened to me talk. Little did he know what he was getting himself into. I cry a lot, over things that don't make any sense to him. He'll use a verbal tone he thinks is normal only for me to start tearing up and shut down. We've been dating for almost two years, and after all that time, I can't imagine how frustrating it is to have to constantly deal with my crying spells. A lot of the time, during these crying spells, I'll talk a lot, just spewing shit out, trying to somehow explain to him why I'm like this. He has done things that hurt me, but not anything that is ""objectively"" painful:

For example, he told me he had ordered a birthday gift for me, but never did. Lying is one of my biggest triggers, so I think about that a lot. He would play video games for hours, making me feel ignored, but we solved that pretty quickly. While he's playing video games, he will use angry language that makes me scared (my dad is 6'2"", terrifying huge biting voice when he's angry). Little things, all things that I weigh in my head everyday, knowing that they're not that big of a deal, but nevertheless i toil in my mind all the time trying to figure out if he's going to hurt me really badly one day. I'm convinced he thinks I'm stupid because sometimes he uses a tone that sounds like that. I have these kinds of delusional thinking. Though I know they're probably delusional, I ruminate and ruminate all the fucking time weighing all these things. Forgot to mention i suspect i have pure OCD. I do most of the cleaning, and a lot of my recent crying spells have been about feeling taken advantage of because of that, and i get really overwhelmed when things are too messy. Btw, my idea of what is clean is not that intense, and im DEFINITELY not the tidiest person in the world lol. When my crying is about him, he will turn it onto himself and sometimes start crying and ask me if im breaking up with him. Then I reassure him that it's okay and that I'm not going to do that. I don't mind doing this, but this has happened so many times and I feel like the issue isn't getting solved because I'm so scared of his emotions. I still do most of the cleaning lol.

When we were planning our trip home for the holidays (we're college students) I wanted to return to our apartment a week before the semester started because I don't like living with my family. Since my boyfriend's dad was kindly arranging the flight, I asked him to ask if we could plan for that week early return home. Didn't happen, even though he said he would ask. The few days before the flight back, I was anxious and in tears all the time. He said he'd schedule it for a week earlier, and his dad agreed, but then my boyfriend started crying because he didn't want his parents to think that he didn't want to spend time with him. May I mention that his family is like. Super oddly healthy? they are amazing, and I love them, so I told him to keep the original time. I consistently sacrifice my own emotions for his, which I'm happy to do, but I have no evidence that he would do the same for me. and that scares the living shit out of me.

Recently, when I start crying for whatever reason, he seems like he cares less about it than he used to. compared to when we first started dating, he seems much less scared to hurt me... while im still relatively the same level of sensitive, although ive definitely gotten better in the last few months. I have this weird sense that he's more frustrated, that he listens less. I worry now that he doesn't listen at all, even though I have no proof of that. sometimes when i imply im sad he'll go ""oh no"" or ""oh god"" and he sounds sweet saying it, but i have this insane deep dread and guilt that i am fraying him down. Last week, I was crying to him really hard, and I realized after saying a little anecdote about my family, it didn't sound as bad out loud as the emotions I was feeling. I expressed this and he agreed, but said that all the little things compounded were hurtful. Whenever i try to bring up trauma, I feel like he shrinks away a little bit... like he doesn't seem to fully believe me? I desperately want him to, because I feel like it would explain my behavior, but whenever I try i feel like it just falls flat. there's so much i don't remember.

I've been doubting whether I really went through anything at all in these 19 years of my life. In terms of mental health, I'm much better than I was just a couple years ago. My family life is better too... not perfect, but better. no more daily screaming between my mom and sister. My mom especially has become such a bright, funny, spunky woman and I think she's great. My relationship with her is my most complicated. I find myself unhurt by things that would have hurt me a few years ago, especially when its my parents doing it, but so so so hurt by tiny things my boyfriend, or even random strangers do, that make me wonder what the hell is wrong with me... shouldn't my family make me hurt the most? they used to, but now it's like everything is switched.

i think maybe its that my boyfriend has shown me the most unconditional love ive ever known, and im so terrified that its not real. if i can catch it before it catches up to me, then the lack of surprise will make it hurt less. i know all these things. ive analyzed myself inside and out. ive made progress. i spend most of my mental energy analyzing myself, thinking about my reactions and why they happen, adjusting my outward reactions, thinking about what i say, etc. i am by no means someone who doesn't know they have issues and takes it out on his boyfriend all the time with these crying spells. i just have these reactions that i wish so so badly i could control...or explain better. ive explained so fucking much, so why don't i feel like he believes me? why do i still feel a wall, despite how much of myself ive spewed? how naked and vulnerable ive made myself? ive shown him all of me, but its like there is semi opaque glass between the true, raw me ive shown him, and him. it's like no matter how much i show, no matter how much he wants to understand, he just....can't.

I think the reason this bothers me and scares me is because I am always, always gentle. Its not really easy being gentle but it's not that difficult either. i love him more than anything and i always want to be kind and understanding. I never yell, i never use a harsh tone, ever. ever ever ever. i do little gestures in thought of him. sometimes, i think the reasons these things hurt, is because i know i would never do them. i know he is just a normal person from a normal family where using a slightly different tone doesn't mean anything besides fatigue, but even when im super tired and super hungry, i do not act rude. there are times he's just kind of ...not mean or rude in an aggressive sense, but in a much more subtle way cuz hes super gentle that scares me even more. i hate to type this here. i know if he saw this he'd be heartbroken that i have these thoughts. i just want to...i dont know. these small things have been hurting me less recently, but i feel like asking him to be constantly gentle isn't realistic for someone. that would involve him repressing his emotions, and i dont want him to have to do that. im his confidant, his best friend, his lover. i will see him through everything, and i understand the true reasons behind every harsh tone...i guess im wondering if this kind of thing will ever stop hurting. if ill ever stop being scared?

how do i make him understand? is there really anything to understand? have i just been oversensitive this whole time, the entire 19 years? what cant i remember? did i do all this damage to myself? did i create a false world inside my head that i let damage me? did i let all those people hurt me? what if what they did wasn't that bad, and i was just young so everything hurt more?

CPTSD,Books on CPTSD?,"Does anyone have any recommendations/ found any books on CPTSD, and any ones that helped you gain an understanding?"
CPTSD,Food for thought...,"I've been here a while, and I've noticed some common threads from many different folks. 

One thing that has been key in healing and really helped me was the realization that I am my own person.

Everyone is experiencing the world through their own perception. That includes you. For the majority of my life, I always felt like an afterthought for someone. I didn't have my own thoughts or feelings, wants, or desires... I was just at the whim of the scariest/strongest person in the room. But that changed when I realized I didn't have to engage with people in that way. I didn't have to categorize myself or think of myself as lower than these other folks. 

You can imagine it like a storybook. Everyone is the main character in their own story. That means you are, too. And when you have thoughts or feelings, you don't have to relinquish them to anyone. You can just have them. 

You don't have to acquiesce to someone else's opinion, ever. You dont have to find a consensus or agree. You dont have to think what everyone else in the group thinks. You can be an individual. 

You can nod in ""agreement"" while silently telling yourself your true feelings. Hold space for yourself. 

It doesn't matter if it's your mom/dad or your family or your partner, or whoever. They are not you. You are you. 

This is part of developing the self. Something many of us didn't get the chance to do. 

A lot of posts here are filled with frustration that you internally feel like you should be your own person but have been taught or threatened into always being enmeshed with others. I get it. I've been there. I lived most of my life there. But you don't have to stay there.  It's possible for things to get better. You're here, after all. If you didn't want to feel better, you wouldn't be here. Congratulate yourself for that. "
CPTSD,I feel pathetic for being so affected by childhood bullying,"If Iâ€™m being totally honest, childhood bullying fucked me up more than being molested because I was only molested by one person but no matter where I went everyone seemed to gang up on me. I went through my whole life with a target on my back and I canâ€™t even say it made me stronger. Iâ€™m obviously overcompensating and I feel like everyone else can smell it on me. Everyone knows that one short skinny guy who lifts weights and tries to look â€œtoughâ€ because he never got over being bullied as a kid. Iâ€™m a walking stereotype in every way. Iâ€™m 17 and I still ruminate over things that happened to me when I was 11 or younger every day and looking at the posts on this subreddit makes me feel ten times worse, knowing that there are people upwards of 40 years old on here who are still stuck in the same mindset that I am (not to shame people who are like this but I feel hopeless)."
CPTSD,Am I wrong for being disappointed in people all the time?,"One thing I love and cherish about this subreddit is that so many people seem to get ""it"". I'm not really sure how to properly put into words, but from the topics of the discussion and the way people type I feel a real sense of connection with you all here, maybe it's the trauma or just the experiences that make you more understanding of others.

However what I really struggle with is just seeing people in real life and being so judgemental, so dismissive. Everything seems so fake and superficial. Everytime I find a person who I can maybe tolerate I always find it so easy to find some reason to break things off. Is this a destructive habit? Like I feel so cripplingly alone all the time but being around people doesn't help. The type of connection I crave just isn't there but am I just sabotaging myself but cutting everyone off, do I not give these things time to grow? But then can anything grow if I'm just miserable with these people all the time? And is it even then that's the problem when I'm the one who can't tolerate anything or anyone?"
CPTSD,"PLEASE HELP! I want to stop staying up late, but nighttime is the only time I feel safe","I've been struggling with going bed early for a long time and I don't know what to do. I always associated nighttime with safety, like it's the only time I feel relaxed and comfortable enough to be myself."
CPTSD,Anyone else has a trauma about â€œwasting time â€œ ?,"My parents had a lot of â€œ you are wasting time â€œ, â€œ you are wasting your life â€œ , etc messages. It makes me micromanage my time to an extreme degree. Anyone else?"
CPTSD,Hi to anyone reading this,"In 2020 I started having flashbacks. I always knew growing up, deep down, that something happened to me. I used to play a game with myself and stare into space and pretend I wasn't in my own body. I pretended my soul was leaving my body and able to live someone else's life for a bit. I realized years later by talking with my therapist and reading these threads that we just innately have these coping mechanisms in us sometimes. I would lock my bathroom door and sit on the sink letting cold water run down my hands. I loved going into the closet because being alone and unseen felt safe.  The biggest thing I did was disassociate. I think everyone thought I was a bit dumb, including myself, but I think I just wanted to protect myself by not remembering anything. 

I don't really know what my purpose is in writing this out. I think I just want to share it with someone who isn't my therapist. I have a lot of friends, but only because one of my coping mechanisms is showing people what they want. They aren't very close to where I could call them for support. And the couple of friends that are supportive, I just don't want to break their hearts, ya know. I'd feel embarrassed telling them too. I can imagine them pitying me. Crying maybe and then I'd cry. And then they would always think about it when they looked at me. It would become part of my identity and I don't want this to be part of my wholeness to others. 

The flashbacks I have are me from three years old. It's really really challenging to not be able to confirm 100% what happened. It drives me crazy that I will never really know how they assaulted me. I remember bits and pieces. It's strong feelings. It's blurry things where I can't remember the exact details. Did it happen on the couch covered in plastic? Did it happen on the daybed with the red bed frame? 

One of the silver linings of finally remembering was being able to trace everything back. My severe reaction of almost fainting when the security guard pressed himself against my body to dance. The panic, the freezing. I also remembered these angels I made up in my childhood. They were two little cherubs on each of my shoulders. One was sassy and chaotic and the other was very straight-laced and sweet. They would always reassure me that they would take care of me. I was happy to be able to remember them again.

The 4 year anniversary of me having the flashbacks is coming up on February 22nd. I am going to do something nice for myself. Go to a museum, maybe a nice dinner. I'm crying as I write this. I'm a big crier. It's all heartbreaking, but then there's those little parts that peak through that are sweet. How you managed to hold your own hand through it. How you still found some rays of light in it all. 

Thank you for reading this. It means a lot to share with other people who get it. I am so sorry it happened to you, to us. We deserved so much better. "
CPTSD,Why do I feel like a massive asshole anytime I set boundaries with people?,"It wouldnâ€™t be anything derogatory or yelling or cussing. It would be simply stating or asking a need or a want from family, or just telling people what Iâ€™m okay with or not. Or what Iâ€™m not comfortable with. Just basic boundary setting. But anytime I do I overthink if Iâ€™m abusive, narcissistic, a bad person, insert any beating myself up term and I *hate* myself for this.

Most of the times I donâ€™t reach out or set proper boundaries and I see other people being able to set them without overthinking theyâ€™re a shitty person. Then right before I set my boundary I sometimes get defensive emotionally because I feel like Iâ€™m a shitty person for even speaking up. I donâ€™t understand why I do this and itâ€™s eating me up."
CPTSD,Anyone else expect punishment constantly?,"And has it led to learned helplessness in you? I feel like my brain and body are constantly in fight or flight mode the moment I have to do anything that involves me interacting other people.

I haven't been severely punished, ostracized, or mocked in years yet it's like my body is constantly anticipating these things. I have to make a call tomorrow and I've been shaking nauseous all day thinking about it.

It makes me feel pathetic. I'm 22, I'm an adult. I should be PASSED this by now. Yet I still feel like the confused 6-7 year old getting scolded, laughed, and excluded by everyone for every little or big mistake. I was never offered help, just ridicule. So now I feel great shame and fear of asking for help and making mistakes 

I know this sub isn't fond of the term victim mentality, and I wouldn't use this term to describe anyone else's mental state because idk what they've been through and how they handle life as a result. 

But for me, I feel like I do have a victim mentality right now. Sure I can blame my parents for this, but what can they do now? Only I can fix myself, only I can save myself. This fear and the anxiety is eating me alive. 

I sabotage all of my efforts of transitioning into adulthood because of this. I can't really vent to the people in my life because even though they care about me, I can kinda tell my bs irritates them  And why wouldn't it? Nobody wants to parent an adult. Even I'm getting sick of myself and my complaining 

I've been whining about the same issues for about 3 years now and made zero progress when I know I can do it. Is this common for people with c-ptsd? If you had learned helplessness, how long did it take you to finally come out of it? 

What pushed you to free yourself?"
CPTSD,My [33/F] friend [33/F] doesn't believe that I was abused by my father. What should I do?,"Hi all,  
As per my previous post, my \[33/F\] friend \[33/F\] of 29 years confronted me at dinner over the things her mother \[68/F\] had obviously been told by my father \[71/M\]. I was willing to open up about my trauma, but she wasn't interested in listening.  
The one I was most concerned about was that I had mental health issues related to the hormones I take to treat endometriosis. I do have mental health issues, but they are related to complex PTSD. I knew this narrative had come from my father because he tells everyone that I'm ""crazy from all the hormones"".  
Once you've read the messages, what would you recommend? What should I do?  
I wanted to work things out between us, so I sent this message:  
""Hey,

  
I wanted to get in touch because I have been feeling a bit unsettled after we had dinner. You made a lot of inferences about my mental health in relation to the hormonal treatment Iâ€™m receiving.

  
I really donâ€™t know where you got these ideas from because I have never had mental health issues related to the hormones I take. Mental health issues are not a side effect of the medications I take.

  
I suspect that you are relaying information that has been passed from my dad to your mum. Itâ€™s difficult to explain without more context, but my dad has been known to embellish the truth to paint himself in a more favourable light. My mum has admitted to dadâ€™s tendency to do this as well.  


Iâ€™m willing to talk to you further about the things that have gone on in my family, but I need you to be transparent and honest with me about what you have been told.  
xxxx""  
Her response baffled me. It was as follows:  
""I have been nothing but transparent and honest. For u to imply otherwise is grossly insulting. What do u mean by mental health issues when I never mentioned anything of the sort ? All I recall mentioning is the connection between medication and mood. This is the second time u have been extremely aggressive towards me. I took it the first time but have no intention of letting u get away with nonsense a second time. What your father says to anybody is not my concern. All I can say is that I have not been told anything that u claim your father told my Mum. I am not even sure if they have had any contact. Do not take out your personal issues on me. I remember sending u a SMS on 12 January last year saying u had my full support. I doubt if I will feel the same way again given your unjust, unfounded, rubbish allegations. U make me wonder if u do indeed have mental health issues. What an about face from your pleasant words when we parted that evening. I was even happy for u to come to my home on NYE. Whilst what has gone on in your family is not my concern, I am still happy to listen and support. Surprisingly it took u days to conjure up imaginative stories. Any specific conspiratorial reason behind wanting to communicate only on Facebook ? Marketing reasons donâ€™t cut it.""  
I then replied:  
""Extremely aggressive? Reread the previous message. There is no aggression - I am simply trying to get to the bottom of this.  
I spoke to my mum about what you said, who spoke to my dad and confirmed that he spoke to your mum about a year ago. It was pretty clear from a few things you said that your mum had passed on things that my dad had told her, especially the comments about my parents' investments in the 90s.  
You also asked me if I thought I was pampered. I think I said yes, but in hindsight I have no idea why. I don't think I'm pampered at all. I have to ask my parents for money for my medical costs, and I'm fortunate to have that, but I'm hardly pampered. My mum agreed.  
I don't blame your mum, if that's what you're worried about. My dad has a long history of doing this and I can't think of a single person in my private life who hasn't been contacted by my dad in the past five years.  
Be careful not to make judgements of people before you know the full story re the mental health allegations. You really don't know what goes on behind closed doors.  
When I said goodbye to you after dinner, I wasn't being disingenuous. It took me a while to process what you had said and think about how I would respond. The things that have gone in my personal life are not easy to talk about, and I have to consider the effect that speaking about them will have on me.  
Communicating on Facebook isn't related to a conspiracy. I just receive a lot of text messages, from doctors, the post office, websites requiring security codes, etc - and when I receive texts that I need to respond to, I tend to forget to respond because they get lost in the list. On Facebook, I only communicate with people I know and your message doesn't drop too far down the list. I also have Facebook open while I'm working during the day, so I'm less likely to forget.""  


Thank you for reading!

  
tl;dr Friend turned on me after my dad spoke to her mum. What should I do?"
CPTSD,"Can someone please teach me how to cry? Just anything, any tip or advice",
CPTSD,Ex who I'm still recovering from acts like we're friends,"An ex from a couple of years ago keeps contacting me when he's coming to town. He had anger issues and I'm still processing and recovering from the damage he inflicted.
I tried to end the relationship unsuccessfully until the final time, when he still tried to act like I was his gf and made unreasonable demands.  He finally moved back to his state and visits mine once or twice a year. He contacts me to meet up, and is so oblivious to the damage he caused me, emotionally and other. My sleep schedule is still messed up after two years from being in complete adrenal exhaustion from the stress.
I have tried to subtly turn him down. He just can't take a hint.  I don't want confrontation, I don't even feel ready to talk to him. He always gaslit and denied any accountability so I don't want to tell him the real reason and have him gaslight me again (or Maybe he is so delusional that he believes he is blameless).
What finally helped me feel validated was contacting his ex who also refuses to speak to him, and learn that she went through identical emotional abuse.
She said he's become much worse with me, and yet he would claim not to know why she wanted nothing to do with him.
He would always act clueless and confused if I tried to point out his behavior and it's consequences. From the other side, so many things became clear. I haven't been able to date since because I'm still unpacking so much shit I should have never tolerated.
He just messaged me that he's coming to town and wants to show up at my work. I really don't want to see him. But I don't want to explain why. He never was any good at reading the room. I avoided him last time with a lame excuse that I was sick. I am now stressing at even being reminded of him. I'm usually very pragmatic with objects, but for the first time ever, I had to purge all the stuff he gave me or left at my place."
CPTSD,Why does basic advice feel so condescending?,"I know that most people have good or at least neutral intentions when they give me advice, but it seems like the only answers I get are extremely basic and underestimate my understanding of things. It makes me feel like people automatically assume I have no self awareness when they feed me a line like ""Things will not change without changing them"" or something along the lines of ""Did you know therapy exists?""

I don't know, I guess it just feels like something generic to say to anyone with a pulse. I don't expect for anyone who gives me advice to give me a massively profound insight that suddenly changes my whole life but it seems like there are never any new answers. Just the most easy things to regurgitate.

I've basically had to raise myself emotionally and have put my every thought under a microscope just to make sure I don't end up like the people in my life who hurt me: inconsiderate, absolutely no self awareness, and no will to improve as a person. I know I still have a lot to work through and I'm not perfect, but at the same time I don't think I'm so oblivious that I have no self discipline to change or just have a two dimensional understanding of the world. I do already use some of the things people advise me to do but it does not cure my chemical imbalances. It's just a band aid on a bigger wound. I'm waiting for my application to be processed for therapy but I'm not optimistic due to a past experience.

The thing I am most sensitive to being told as someone with bad social anxiety (to the point of being agoraphobic) is either being told to ""Just put yourself out there!"" or ""Just make friends online"" when neither of those things have improved my problems. I can't suddenly ""decide"" to be confident when any happiness or comfort I took in myself is/was constantly destroyed by the people around me, and people online don't see you as a real person when you are behind a screen most of the time. I spent my earliest teen years up until last year trying to make real connections that way and it doesn't work 95% of the time. I've only ever made two long term friends that I didn't feel judged by and one ended up being a p*do so I'm done with that shit. Anyone else was just an acquaintance that drifted away slowly until it didn't matter.

I guess I'm so used to being ignored at this point that I would rather just be ignored than feel the disappointment of someone giving me advice that feels like it's coming from a place of apathy or assumptions about my lack of ability to improve my life. I haven't actively sought advice in a long while to save myself the disappointment but people give it to me anyway so I feel it either way. It mostly just makes me want to shut myself off more. That part is probably a trauma response to feeling uncared for but it's hard to shut off when my faith in people is already shaky at best."
CPTSD,Am I to blame for my problems? Or my abusers,
CPTSD,DAE have dreams about harming their abuser as a young child?,"When I was 6 I had a dream (it may have been a recurring dream) about stabbing/killing my dad. It is still vivid in my mind and I was completely wracked with guilt over it well into adulthood. For a long time it was my â€œbig dark secretâ€ that I had wanted that instead of extending forgiveness.

Looking back the idea that a 6 year old would be wrestling with those thoughts towards a caregiver is such a gigantic red flag that the environment was not safe. It is wild to me that I was able to turn that reality into inward shame. Anyone else relate?"
CPTSD,Unable to relax,"99.9% of the time I feel unable to relax even though I want to. I know I need rest and atm I'm unemployed/free intentionally, and I keep beating myself up for not resting/feeling rested, but I genuinely don't know how. I suppose this is a common experience and not actually my fault, and not something I have direct/fast control over other than a long time of practicing, recovery and probably therapy? I just... keep beating myself up so much. I've been trying to work out for at least HALF A DECADE how to relax, throwing so much shit at the wall and so little sticks. I feel so, so, so, so stuck and I'm extremely terrified. Because if this keeps going at this pace, I'll die so fucking unhappy. Anybody have suggestions on the first baby step one could take (and I mean, a very very very very tiny tteny tiny step, I get overwhelmed very easily) to get out of fight-flight?"
CPTSD,Anti vax parents,"I wrote something on a different sub and realized that it'd be helpful to put it here, so its a copy paste, but I wrote it all.

I am a child of anti-vax parents. I only got vaccines for 3-4 years before being stopped completely. 

  
I am 15. I get sick quite often. I have to stay home from school a lot because I am so exhausted that I feel I might die. I am also severely mentally ill. My lungs are not the best, neither is my heart, not my liver, not my kidneys, there is so much bullshit in my body I may be dead before 50. 

  
I also was never taken to the doctor unless it was an emergency (bones hurting, even then most of the time I would just get that $2 Walmart wrap sports bandage thing) and even one time my mom said that she wouldn't take me to the hospital even if I broke my bones. 

  
At my old school, full of parents just like her, a family all got chickenpox. I did not, because I'd been vaccinated for it very young. I do not thank ""god"" for it. I thank time, and my parents being immigrants and properly schooled before getting brainwashed to America's anti vax problem.

   
I have probably been told a million times that the ""cabal"" will come get me and take my adrenochrome through murdering me and using syringes to inject it out of my body. I have seen videos of chanting and sacrifices. I have known what shit took place on Twitter 2020, then Parler, then Telegram. 

  
I have been denied healthcare so long and the mental illness in my head combination makes me feel that I am so strong I can take anything, even suicide attempts and neglect. Logically I know that it isn't true, and it will all catch up to me one day (one time I got so sick for one week, I thought I was going to die in my sleep) but it is only my age that keeps me alive. 

  
And the thing is, I do not want to be alive. Living with parents like these has cost me so much. I just woke up from two nightmares about them. But at least, sometimes, it does not feel so bad, and I can forget these things. Which is the only reason I can keep on going. 

Does anyone have anything similar to this? The whole homeschooling (that ""school"" I was in was a homeschool co-op with 50 students grades 5-12 and all anti-vax fundie christian creationist parents) thing, the healthcare neglect thing, etcetera? Any details on how this can affect the brain? 

There is this significant chunk of my life about this that I have hidden. The pain of healthcare neglect. Knowing as a child something is wrong. Getting beaten for it. Being told it is just the internet, when it is clearly much more. Knowing WHAT to do about it. Not being able to do it because your parents would rather see you suffer in agony than take you to ""Big Pharma trying to sell you cancer-causing medications!""

(tagged physical abuse because bloody hell allowing someone to suffer in intense physical pain like that IS physical abuse)"
CPTSD,Feeling lonely and tired of having to heal today,"I'm feeling really lonely today. It's one of those days where I do feel broken and damaged, even though I try so hard to tell myself I'm not. I wish someone I loved and who loves me was here to spend time with me so I wouldn't be so lonely at home, but a person like that doesn't exist. 

I'm afraid I'll never be normal and be able to spend time around other normal people and just live life and have fun. ""Healing"" feels like a scam and it'll never be done. I feel like I'll have to ""heal"" forever and never be able to live a normal life like everyone else. Maybe it was in Pete Walker's book, but I read somewhere that it takes half your age to heal, from the time you begin healing. That means I'm stuck like this for another 8-9 years."
CPTSD,DAE chose their outfit meticulously when planning to attempt?,"Feeling very suicidal, I can barely afford anything but at this point id rather starve because I dont really care anymore. I wish to buy designer clothes before I die. I want to wear my best before I leave this world. I already have some outfit templates. Im working on getting designer stuff to make my corpse look boujee lol. Maybe its just me but im wondering if this is a thing thats common or do other people go thru this too?"
CPTSD,Body Map Infographic - Identifying Emotions,"In Pete Walker's *Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving*, there's a section on knowing when you're in an emotional flashback. He advises readers that the [most common clue](https://pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html#Flashback) is feeling ""small, helpless, hopeless and so ashamed that we are loath to go out or show our face anywhere."" 

I chronically struggle with identifying my own emotions. I can identify others' emotions but can't label my own. The best I can do is describe a feeling as ""bad"" or ""good"". This makes detecting an emotional flashback difficult.

However, I recently came across an infographic from a National Academy of Sciences journal article that shows body activation maps for both simple (fear, sadness, etc.) and complex emotions (anxiety, depression, shame, etc.). It shows where study participants felt increased ""activation"", i.e., sensations, in their bodies during an emotion, and where they felt less. Here's the link to the infographic in the article: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1321664111#fig02](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1321664111#fig02) 

I look back on this infographic frequently when I can't determine what I'm feeling. Emotional flashbacks can be disorienting when they're not tied to an easily discernible memory. Hopefully, this resource will be helpful to others."
CPTSD,How do I know if something is a trauma response?,"This question has been on my mind lately because I was thinking about something that happened in the past. Well, in middle school I didn't like how this girl was treating me, so i decided one day I was going to confront her, I was afraid and anxious to do so because I've never confronted anyone before. When I tried confronting her I literally froze and could not move at all, it was a non-life threatening event. Would this be a trauma response or not?"
CPTSD,Learning from people here,"I canâ€™t remember who it was that posted the other day about dysfunctional attachment relationships with their parents but they or someone who commented (my brain fog is v foggy rn) about the Patrick teahan toxcitciry test made me investigate further. 

I talked to my partner about this today (who has a good relationship with his parents, what a wild time) and asked if it was normal to be scared of your parents. He was bemused. Apparently it never crossed his mind to be scared of his parents but he could see I was scared of my dad, even though I desperately wanted his approval. 

I appreciate this is a biased audience, but isnâ€™t it at least a bit normal to be scared of your parents as a kid?"
CPTSD,But like what am I supposed to do with trauma??,"I guess this seems goofy but srsly. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for years now and we talk about it and lots of other ransom stuff. I never really sat down and thought what does this mean, what am I supposed to do about it. Iâ€™ve automatically just held that it means im broken and the world is scary but like. For people who heal and are healing what are you supposed to do with if not deny it or make bizzare belifs about it. What do I actually do to not make it define my life, and be so overwhelming to recall?"
CPTSD,How do I know if a sudden flashback is false?,"Iâ€™ve always had a weird history with memories of SA. I know some that did happen as a teen when I was 15, and one at 18, but in a way they didnâ€™t feel like it was the first time. A bit later as an adult I picked up that a weird embarrassing memory as a kid with a teacher mustâ€™ve been more than just shameful. 

There are a bunch of signs, right? That stuff mightâ€™ve happened to me, but I hate how uncertain I feel about everything. I am more than certain that one happened, since I just changed the lenses I viewed it with.

But, some day, while I was taking a shower, I suddenly started having a really vivid image about my own father doing things to me in the shower. Vague images and odd sensations that almost made me throw up, smells, sounds. After that I donâ€™t even know how to process something like that. 

It HAS to be fake, right? I mean, I donâ€™t know him well, but everyone has told me good things about him, and he himself was assaulted once as a kid . Heâ€™s my dad, and I find it hard to see him willing to hurt me.

Please, tell me how to disprove this or something, I want myself to stop fucking repeating â€œwhat ifâ€ in my head. I want this to stop existing. It doesnâ€™t make sense"
CPTSD,Success eliminating or reducing nightmares? IRT vs Neurofeedback vs EMDR vs Medication,"Hi everyone, 

&#x200B;

I've been dealing with PTSD (from a google search CPTSD describes me more, just haven't had a doc say that specifically) from about 2 decades worth of trauma. I have many symptoms, but my worst that most greatly impacts quality of life are my nightmares. I have so many every night. I never have neutral or good dreams. 

&#x200B;

They're as ""light"" as stressful, anxiety inducing situations (i.e. forgot I had an exam, back in high school, can't use my pencil) to horrific scenes like someone's trying to murder me. And the ultra specific, fighting with my mother who is the source of my CPTSD. Often, the nightmares occur in my childhood home even if she is not present, so that exam I forgot about is taking place in my house. 

&#x200B;

I tolerated these nightmares as much as possible for years and years, but the last 4 or so months they've really gone off the deep end. I feel awful. My sleep is so terrible. 

&#x200B;

In the past, I've tried EMDR, with no results. I just completed 6 ketamine therapy sessions and honestly feel only a 5% improvement in my overall mind, but no improvements in nightmares. I am mulling over whether to continue the ketamine, as the costs are $475 per treatment and I had hoped I'd see better results after 6 sessions. 

&#x200B;

I cannot take this anymore. I did a little image rehearsal therapy, but only wrote out the nightmares and gave them new endings. I didn't revisit the drawings and plan to do so this week. I also try the pre-sleep positivity reinforcement ""I'll only have good dreams..."" thing. No luck. 

&#x200B;

For those of you who suffered from nightmares and they're now so much better or totally gone, what worked? I will try anything. 

&#x200B;

I am open to meds, currently only on Gabapentin. I came off all my other meds as I am having moderate health issues this year and needed to make sure my meds weren't causing them. 

&#x200B;

I know there are the options of prazosin or clonidine. The only issue is my blood pressure is already on the low of normal (96/55, 108/65, 95/55 are the last 3 readings I took at home.) and standing up quickly (especially in yoga/orange theory), can make me dizzy. I've yet to have it actually be a problem. It's more a nuisance I am mindful of when exercising that involves bending over or standing up too fast.

Anyway, I am really struggling and need some suggestions/success stories. I just quit my talk therapy a few weeks ago and want to find a new provider who specializes in nightmares. Thanks everyone. It's been a tough journey. "
CPTSD,Unsure how to process a SA,"I (F mid 30s) bought myself a massage package a while ago and decided to use it yesterday. I was very excited given thank I was recently laid off and needed something to feel better about myself. 

I was assigned a male masseuse and I didnâ€™t think anything of it; Iâ€™ve had male masseuses in the past with no issues. This time was different. For 90 minutes this man pressed his erect penis against me as he massaged my body, and purposefully exposed my breasts. He also touched very close to my vagina â€œaccidentallyâ€ pulled down my panties.

As someone who has experienced SA in my childhood and as an adult, this is sending me into a spiral. I wanted to scream for help but I couldnâ€™t make a sound. I walked out of there like a zombie, no feelings or emotions. 

Now Iâ€™m beating myself up for not pushing him off, not yelling or screaming. Iâ€™m so ashamed. I told my bf, and heâ€™s being very supportive, but I donâ€™t know what to do with all my feelings. Iâ€™m too afraid to report the man, because who will believe me? Itâ€™s his word against mine. 

I also canâ€™t fathom how i experienced SA again after already been through it so many times. It makes me wonder what Iâ€™m doing to attract this? How can I be a victim so many times? Why should anyone believe me?"
CPTSD,"Usually, what types of therapy work best when treating cPTSD?","Hello there! Undiagnosed here, but a long time lurker in this sub-reddit. Ever since I first read about cPTSD, things just kind of clicked (what led me here actually). I've been struggling with this for a couple of years but I think I am finally ready to try for a possible diagnosis so I can better handle the accumulative symptoms, some that have surely grown over the years since their onset.

I've done therapy before but it wasn't all that effective in the long-term, it was more like a short-term band-aid, treating the symptoms on a week to week basis, not the wound itself (I tried psychoanalysis, wich is kind of iffy about giving diagnosis so I don't know).

I would like to know what types of therapy would be best for me to get a more objective analysis of my symptoms in relation to my childhood trauma and know what the heck is this that I'm feeling. I've considered CBT before, but never actually done it, because I though I was just anxious, but it was most likely a strong symptom of cPTSD. Is CBT still effective for cPTSD or should I try something more specific?

I wanna also thank this sub, reading all the posts and comments have surely help me validate my experience and get at least some pieces of the puzzle together, before trying to find the whole picture in actual therapy."
CPTSD,"Iâ€™m tired of being the scape goat and problem solver, can I just live?!","Oh, here we go again, of course my brother and my mother are having disputes again and who has to solve their problem??? ME. Despite not living in the same household anymore, like Jesus they act like a bunch of kids. Iâ€™m the youngest one of the three and you have a an adult child at 34 with an adult who just manipulates and complains and threatening to leave or off herself because heâ€™s not respecting her boundaries and her space. Jesus. Like communication exist.

Like Iâ€™m so tired, Iâ€™m tired of always being the glue of this damn family when no one wants to act like a damn adult and if I speak about it I get ridiculed despite trying to help the situation. She sent me 8 messages about the situation and Iâ€™m not responding. Iâ€™m finally trying to get better, trying to recover from my breakup which I hid my relationship for 8 months because I couldnâ€™t stand the shame and pity that I would get by being told â€œyou see this is why men arenâ€™t the priority, you should know betterâ€ always treated like Iâ€™m the deer in the headlights. No wonder my emotions and triggers are triggered so easily, the fight or flight mode always present because I have nothing to cling on. Like itâ€™s not my job to fucking parent you! Youâ€™re the parent, youâ€™re  the mother! Learn how to communicate without the defensiveness, the hostility, the weak mentality of taking everything so damn personal! Like nothing he does is about you! But you rather make yourself the victim and enable his behaviors. Your tactics of fear and manipulation is whatâ€™s wrong with you! For once if you came from a loving, gentle place maybe he would fucking listen but all you see is punishment. You rejected him your life just because of his mistakes and not once did you treat him like a mother, you treated him like a dictator. How disgusting instead of repairing you would rather run away.

This family is fucking fucked up. What an embarrassment . No wonder I swallow and cave myself as a kid when these things happen. Iâ€™m pushing 30 and I canâ€™t even live my own life without watching and feeling I have to be depended on when I feel like I have no one myself. So fucking toxic and I hate it."
CPTSD,How do you get through lonely terror?,"the kind of terror where you feel panicked, unsettled, unsafe.    

Where you want someone to be with you and help you feel protected.  But there's no one.

When life feels unsalvageable.... when the world feels to scary and difficult to stay in.  Where you can't function in it. 

I don't feel my deterioration or quality of life matters to anyone. As long as I don't cause any problems or draw attention to myself. 

I want a parent attachment so bad,  it feels so missing,  I feel wobbly... like I am standing on one leg and i didnt get given a second one,   like I'm half developed,  and the sad thing it is irreplaceable. I didn't get those needs and now I probably never will. 

Omg, this is just hell on earth. Absolute torture and torment.  

How do you make it to the next day?

P.s,  thank you to all who reply and/or replied to my other threads. I read them all and they are so helpful "
CPTSD,Sobriety and flashbacks,"I have been sober for a month now but every time I get clean,  Iâ€™m forced to deal with intrusive sporadic flashbacks.

The flashbacks donâ€™t follow any specific timeline, itâ€™s really torturous being in this state of derealisation and all I can think of is these events that have occurred either way back when I was a child (now 23) or recently as couple weeks ago getting out of an abusive relationship. 

Has anyone else had to come to terms with all the trauma they have been burying through substance abuse or any other form of addiction? And did it feel like you had no control over your thoughts or at least itâ€™s always in the back of your head?"
CPTSD,feels like a crime to say no,"in my childhood saying no or I donâ€™t know wasnâ€™t allowed so to this day I struggle to say no to people but it gets easier everytime I do it 

If someone canâ€™t take no for an answer that is their problem not yours so donâ€™t feel bad for putting up your boundary 

No is an answer"
CPTSD,Soâ€¦ turns out â€œperfectionismâ€ might be OCD,"I have long described certain behaviors of mine as â€œperfectionismâ€ - behaviors acquired due to my mom requiring absolute perfection from me my whole childhood, throwing me into moral/general crisis 24/7. 

Aaannnddd i just got diagnosed with OCD. Turns out, it can be OCD even if you know what caused itâ€¦ even if itâ€™s not something shown in media like counting things repeatedly or walking in and out of rooms over and over, even if you remember a time before you had it. 

Just thought iâ€™d throw that out there in case that led to any epiphanies for yâ€™all.

Happy new year!"
CPTSD,"I love my job, but they donâ€™t feel the same wayâ€¦","Iâ€™m feeling beaten down. My job is difficult, I wonâ€™t deny that. However, there are many things I enjoy in my day to day interactions with customers, explaining the processes/next steps, in addition to setting expectations surrounding the scenarios theyâ€™re involved in, and complexities that could go awry, trust me that some of these conversations are not easy to have, and yet I remain compassionate & empathetic. 

Today, I was put on a â€œgrow planâ€ Basically, Iâ€™ll be removed from new work being assigned to me until Friday night due to being behind. Be mindful that we just got off the holidays, most weeks between Thanksgiving we didnâ€™t have a full 5 day week, like we would, plus I took some PTO to celebrate my birthday that is 5 days before Christmas. Did I also mention that during the holidays, there were so many other employees on PTO, that increased mine, my fellow co-workers assigned new & pending workload? 

My supervisor told me he can clearly see that Iâ€™m capable at my job during his case reviews, even with my being behind, he doesnâ€™t get many escalations. During our brief meeting tonight, my direct inquiry was, â€œWhat is it that Iâ€™m inherently doing wrong?â€ He couldnâ€™t come up with anything, just that this will be documented & Iâ€™ll have to meet with him 2â€™x a day for the next week to come up with a plan for the day, as well as meet with two people that are â€œsuccessfulâ€ in their role. 

My point of view is this, now I have to use the first 5 day week weâ€™ve had in an attempt to get caught up, all the while now my time is being taken away from me multiple times a day when I could be focusing on working rking files,  making calls, returning voicemails, emails & texts. Make it make sense, because the only thing I can come up with is metrics.

Did I mention that they laid off 11% of the company in September? 

The corporate world is not built for those that live with CPTSD, of course after the brief meeting, I had a panic attack, that led to many other physical symptoms, worst of all the brain cloudiness & numbness made it extra hard to complete the rest of my day. ðŸ˜”"
CPTSD,Has the loneliness ever gotten better?,"I guess Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone can share their experiences of finding love (platonic, romantic, anything) and connection? My history includes neglect, parentification, and a lot of isolation both on social level and in the day to day I was left alone a lot as a child. Iâ€™ve had a lot of years of therapy and I recognize Iâ€™m a lot better I used to be. Iâ€™ve done a lot of healing, I still just feel perpetually alone.

 I think anyone whoâ€™s felt with an abusive childhood can understand the confusing dynamic of feeling like the people who are hurting you are also the only people you have. I donâ€™t particularly feel close to anyone outside my family but I no longer feel close to any of them either. Itâ€™s like more I heal the less and less I can connect with even them and I end up weirdly feeling even more lonely even though Iâ€™m getting better. 

Feeling like I have no one has led me to focus too much on finding a romantic relationship in the past, to the point that I was willing to accept pretty much any kind of treatment so long as it meant I had someone. Iâ€™ve grown past that at this point which I know is progress but I just feel like Iâ€™m running out of chances to feel connected with people or like Iâ€™m seen and cared for. Can anyone tell me about how it got better for them? Iâ€™m trying really hard to believe thereâ€™s hope and that Iâ€™m still moving towards something better."
CPTSD,DAE feel like their body/illness is an abuser? (chronic illness),"I have ME/CFS, which is an incurable chronic illness characterized by Post Exertional Malaise or PEM. In short, ANY sort of exertion (physical, mental, emotional) causes a backlash of flu like symptoms and can permanently lower your functional baseline. Doctors don't currently understand why it happens or how it works, but it seems to effect the mitochondria and energy production in the entire body.   


I have a decently bad case of ME/CFS, I cant work at all and I can barely leave my house. Even positive, non triggering socializing causes an upswing in symptoms for multiple days afterwards.   


And it just feels like my abusive mother has moved into my body. I feel like this illness acts exactly like her.   


It's so unpredictable, something that's ""ok"" one day suddenly wont be the next day or even hour. It punishes you severely for minor infractions, isolates you from your support network, and eats away what little self esteem you have. It takes all your independence and gives you learned helplessness because its an incurable medical illness. No amount of therapy or ""self care"" will make my mitochondria work again. Oh and lots of people and even doctors think ME/CFS is a ""fake illness"" and we're all ""lazy,  depressed, and hysterical"" or ""faking for attention"".

&#x200B;

Its extremely triggering, which of course makes me sicker because getting triggered is so emotionally draining. It just feels like I'm living in a hell especially designed just for me.   


Has anyone dealt with anything like this?

""Sensitivity to core pains such as being criticized or fear of being abandoned does not go away with nicer words or more listening"""
CPTSD,Support /thoughts?,Just feeling a bit not seen. I have CPTSD along with an eating disorder. Getting Ed treatment that doesn't trigger my cPTSD is really hard. And when I try to talk to people about it they say everyone has a little bit of trauma you're using it as an excuse to not recover. I don't know. Honestly hate myself a little more hearing that. I'm not trying to use it as an excuse. I'm tired of my nervous system . I don't feel in control. 
CPTSD,i have never felt more related to in my entire life,"holy fuck. it all makes sense now. everything about me that i thought was budding sociopathy or that made me a terrible person. just recently i had flashbacks described to me by a mentor of mine and i realized that iâ€™ve had them for years and pretty much all day every day in recent memory. i make gestures and respond to the flashbacks. i never thought my childhood was that bad so i never considered any form of ptsd. i thought i was just borderline.

CPTSD,"During a conflict...I can't tell if I'm ""too sensitive"" or if the situation is truly toxic.","At work I was all alone for 2 hours due to  3 sick co workers. 

Two customers got angry & ""wanted to speak w the manager"" situation.  One called me swear words, the other threw a pen at me when I asked her to write her number down.

A handyman on site saw my distress and called a supervisor from a different store, same franchise.  We shared workers. 

That supervisor ""came in hot"",, yelling  and started accusing me of abandoning the store (I was standing right there- I guess that handy man made it sound like I'd left, I had not) then he said I was probably too old to deal w stress.  I told him he was probably not professional enough to be a supervisor.  

He ran and & slammed the exit so hard he nearly broke the door.  (I can barely open that heavy door- can't believe he slammed it)

&#x200B;

I made a legit report to the company re that supervisor's behaviour.  Not ONE co-worker who came back said, ""I'm sorry that happened"".  They all said how much they like that supervisor- who treated me like dirt. 

&#x200B;

I want to quit but...I just want to prove I'm not too old to deal w stress.  Sounds so stupid now that I write it out...

Should I put in notice?  Is this a toxic place or do I have to ""stick it out to show them""?

Sometimes I can't tell if it's MY shyness or confusion....I do well at this job except when a customer wants a manager...I like my coworkers, but again, not ONE person has offered any condolence for the way the customers reacted or how that other supervisor scared me & put me down.

CPTSD,Why going forward?,"I am graduating in two months. Then I'll find a job that lets me live enough to... To?

What's left here for me? I have no one. Building connections is hard and unfulfilling, yet without connection I feel completely unmotivated to do anything, because why even bother? I am too tired for that anyway. 

I've tried therapy so many times, I'm at the point where I don't think I can find help in that.

I don't know how to push me to go forward. For what do I have to endure all this pain? Things will never get better.

What makes you go forward?"
CPTSD,Stepmom is defending my narc dad,"My dad is a covert narcissist and heâ€™s been a horrible person all my life. As a child I looked up to him and didnâ€™t realize the trauma he was causing me but now I am very aware of who he really is.

My dad is in a relationship with my stepmom and he is absolutely horrible to her. The beginning of their relationship was full of love bombing and she is desperate to get that back. So desperate to the point she is putting the blame onto other people instead of him. Due to my dadâ€™s abuse I have PTSD and his behavior as of lately has been really triggering it. Itâ€™s gotten to the point I will lash out in anger whenever he acts out and itâ€™s honestly not pretty. We get into arguments very often and my stepmom always takes my dadâ€™s side because â€œheâ€™s struggling with his mental health.â€ 

Thats always his story. Heâ€™s always the victim and heâ€™s always â€œstruggling.â€ He has fed that woman so many stories and so many lies trying to paint himself as the victim. I honestly think sheâ€™s trying to save him, but she can never do it. I was in that position once too. I believed him until I didnâ€™t. But because sheâ€™s trying to shelter him and save him she is painting me out to be the villain. She is acting like I am the one tearing our family apart. 

Luckily I am moving out this Saturday. I was already thinking of cutting contact with my dad but I think I might cut her off as well. I feel bad but sheâ€™s becoming insufferable and hurtful. Any advice?"
CPTSD,Iâ€™m not a flake I have CPTSD,"I hate it when managers who once supported me and thought me competent switch up when my CPTSD disables me. Iâ€™m a freelancer.

He doesnâ€™t know why exactly I went AWOL, just that I was personal issues. I kept coming back and then getting sick and disappearing. And now it seems that our friendly rapport is dead.

I know it sound petty and insignificant, but he wonâ€™t even follow me on my socials anymore. 

It sucks when my mental health causes people to lose faith in me. Itâ€™s hard not to take it personally and people-please to win them back.

long story short havenâ€™t spoken to my mother for more than 3 years, she broke down mentally when my father died (i was 17 at the time, just turned 21) 

she has been calling me time to time. i never picked up. i never blocked her number because well, if something happens, the calls will stop, and iâ€™ll notice, and yeah 

she has learnt how to text on her little old nokia 

tonight she texted me â€œi love you say hi to your brother momâ€

they still have a little bit of contact, and well, it just worries me. i overthink a lot. 

i struggle with emotional things.. e.. childhood.  you guys know. another long story short; during these years i have become very confused about what i feel about everything. i think the pain is a little too much so it just sits inside me and i just feel upset in an angry sort of way. and i ignore that anything has happened. â€œnot me ghosting my ill mom. i donâ€™t feel horrible!!! proMISE!!â€

and right now iâ€™m just like.. i canâ€™t take more. 

found out my ex cheated on christmas (i moved 550km to be with her sep 2022). she was my best friend, and the only one i was comfortable with. i loved her. it has been really hard. 

and i got some sickness going on,, i am making a career but due to everything iâ€™m staring to feel burnt out. 

itâ€™s just.. please stop. everything just please stop. stop giving me happiness and stability only to take it away in such a cruel way.

CPTSD,I was sexually harassed and cyberbullied,"I was sexually harassed on the streets last week, an old man around 60 yrs old grabbed my hand and kissed me. I felt very uncomfortable and disgusted afterwards and it triggered my trauma(The way he grabbed me and kissed me reminds me how I was sexually assaulted 5 yrs ago) I called the police but they didn't do anything. I was a foreign student in that country so I posted it on /r czech subreddit while I was having suicidal thoughts and crying in my room, just hoping to receive some comfort. As a result, I received a lot of hate comments from Czech native speakers, ""It's our tradition for him to kiss you,"" ""I suggest you leave the Czech Republic,""""Learn our culture"" ""If this makes you feel suicidal, then I don't know what real life does to you. :)"" ""Come on, I read your posting history. You do have a lot of problems, but that's not a reason why you can blame others."" ""You should go to a asylum."" ""That old man kissing your hand is our etiquette and tradition.""It's not sexual harassment."" ""Your life is really closed and a failure.""""You deserved it you b*tch you f*cking c*nt""Someone made throwaway accounts just to follow me and post hate messages in every post I made. I felt so creepy and scared why do they hate me so much I didn't do anything. Later, a Czech man sent me private messages to say some comforting words, but he later kept asking me for my social account, my photos, and my identity information(my name, my photos, where I came from, my age).  Then he started to message me like crazy, he sent me his photi and tole me his 26 and ""wants love so badly"" and ""I want to meet you next week"","" This is your last chance I will come to meet you in your city next week"" ""I know you want it too"" ""Don't you want it too? somewhere inside you "" and other sexual hints that made me sick to my stomach.  I don't know how anyone could say these things to a girl who had just been sexually harassed and traumatized.  I feel so sick. I don't know why they have so much hate toward me.  people keep having fights and arguments in my post and it made me so stressed and sad. Some people think ""this is not sexual harassment"" and think I'm only""attention seeking"", while other people genuinely care about me and help comfort me and scold the former back.  They kept arguing and my post was locked.  I feel terrible.  My trauma became a topic of debate for others. Since then, I haven't gone to class for a week, I can't get out of bed every day, I can sleep for 20 hours a day, I'm severely depressed, I can't do anything, I don't want to eat, I can't get out of my bed or my room. I'm having a panic attack right now over those memories and what they said to me how how that old man kissed me. I feel like I'm going crazy I'm going to have a mental breakdown I'm going to die I'm scared. Just typing all these makes my hand shiver and my body is sweating why would this happen to me what did I do wrong to deserve this much hate? I don't want to die but I feel like going insane. I've talked to my therapist but I keep having those flashbacks and suddenly burst out crying at 0 am and scared and panicking what should I do I wldo to don't want to feel like this please help me. I really thought 2024 will be a new start and everything will get better I already had bad suicidal thoughts last month I really thought 2024 will get better and everything is ruined EVERYTHING

CPTSD,Is anybody else unable to feel certain emotions?,"Does anybody else have emotions that they feel inaccessible to them? For a little background I grew up in a family with a lot of physical and emotional abuse as well as neglect. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for about two years now and my therapist has said that I have cPTSD. One thing that Iâ€™m still having trouble with is feeling sad.

I havenâ€™t really talked about it much and Therapy because itâ€™s just kind of making sense to me. But like for example Iâ€™m going through a break up right now after a very long term relationship. And I just opened a package that I forgot I had ordered for him. It was some thing that we had bonded over, and it meant a lot to both of us. I also found one of his favorite shirts that we would play â€œfightâ€ over throughout the relationship because it was so comfy. 

Looking at those things, immediately thought to myself. â€œwow that makes me really sadâ€œ. But the thing is that I canâ€™t feel the sadness. I canâ€™t cry, and I donâ€™t feel it in my body. But I know that it makes me sad. Iâ€™ve had similar experiences doing EMDR and just regular therapy. Where my therapist will ask me how I feel and I tell her what Iâ€™m thinking. And she asks me how I feel again not what I think and I just canâ€™t feel anything. And Iâ€™ve also been told by her that I smile when talking about my trauma.  And this is not intentional. Itâ€™s like i know it is sad, but it just doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s happening to me. 

I was just kind of wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I am also on an antidepressant and I know that can sometimes know Iâ€™m emotions, but it seems like I can feel every emotion except for sadness. I feel anxiety, I feel anger, I feel stress, I just canâ€™t feel sad."
CPTSD,Peaceful life dilemma,"So, 
something I've been thinking about a lot lately, is that I do want to change my life this year, move out, find new friends, a partner and do fun social things. 

But at the same time, i don't really like what is considered ""fun things"".

I want to start studying again this year and I am scared about not being able to find friends, because truly, i don't like big parties, heavy drinking and doing reckless, dumb things, just because
 
"" we're so young and crazy"".

Like, I deemed myself as crazy a long time ago and it's no fun. 

When I to clubbing i can mimmic having fun. Or just drink enough to numb the nothingness in me (or partially at least). 

Even now, when I'm trying to be mindful and aware and actually feel my emotions instead of dissociating constantly, i don't get the gist of drinking til you're blacking out and being sick the next day. 

I want to experience the ""real"" meaning behind having friends - hanging around together, drinking coffee at a cafe, supporting and helping each other when it's needed. I need a safe, peaceful period in my life, for once. 

But Im scared it means being lonely . 

Like, how on earth am I going to find friend if what really pleases me is drawing, reading and walking outside (and looking at the sunshine â˜€ï¸)?"
CPTSD,does anyone else with childhood trauma have major issues with their siblings?,"Im in a bit of difficult spot at the moment as im about 8 months away from going to university. however, the uni im going to is the same as my sister, who I find really quite emotionally manipulative and aggressive. she thinks we have a great relationship and says she loves me a lot, however, when something doesn't go her way, she becomes in a fit of rage, and sees no reason or anyones else's point of view. 

this is really hard for me as I know she will want to see me when im at uni but I don't want to see her, as I think we really don't get on and I become very anxious around her. im not sure what I can do about this either as I know if I talk to her about this, she may become distraught and super upset/ angry at me, and though this doesn't change the fact, I will be very uncomfortable in my decision I think.

CPTSD,Anyone else really struggling today in particular?,"The holiday season was predictably difficult, but I rode it out as best I could. But the past couple of days I've really been feeling it, and today in particular is bad. The negative thoughts are really loud, my failures and losses flash up in my head without warning, and I feel hopeless about the future.

I am so tired of feeling like this. "
CPTSD,"Awful at consistently eating and hydrating enough, is this common with CPTSD?","I have always been unable to maintain a consistent intake of food and water. When I wake up I am either uninterested in food or I feel compelled to begin going through my day the moment I am out of bed. Coffee is the only thing I will have every morning. It isnâ€™t a conscious battle in which Iâ€™m telling myself to not eat or to ignore hunger, it just doesnâ€™t seem to register with any urgency. Even if I DO feel a sensation of hunger, I end up glazing over it very quickly.

Up until maybe 4 years ago I was nauseated every morning, which made me quite anxious and created a negative feedback loop (feel like puking > scared of puking/puking at work or school > anxiety increases > nausea increases). 

During the week I will work until 2-3pm before seeking out food, sometimes going as late as 5pm before eating my first meal. Same for water. Although Iâ€™m always aiming to eat more and eat more consistently, the task of eating often feels like I am force feeding myself. 

What is this behavior! It certainly could be related to anxiety disorder, but I wondered if this is common for other CPTSD survivors as well."

	Iâ€™m not what theyâ€™re looking for.
	They want someone stable.
	Without so much baggage.
	Someone whole.

	Abandoned

CPTSD,It's all my fault I think dying is better?," I'm afraid. My parents have already placed me in a psychiatric facility in their country of origin and asked me to return my emergency housing and benefits and to live with them again. After I stayed in institutions through youth care. This made my condition even worse and I felt like a zombie from the amount of medication I was given. Afterwards they arranged guardianship for me based on my medical report from psychiatry in their country. Now they want me to go with them and that way I can get rid of my rule. If I refuse, they threaten me and call me names. They also took my brother there and he is now unhappy in a monastery. A counselor said that if I am that afraid of them, I should file a complaint. I did this but regret it because I love them. I wanted to withdraw the complaint, but this is no longer possible. I miss my brother. No one from my family wants to see me anymore. I feel guilty for all the problems in our family. I see no hope anymore and I don't want to live anymore."

CPTSD,Hidden away by being homeschooled,Hello! Iâ€™ve been wanting to make a post for a little while now! I was wondering if anyone elseâ€™s homeschooling was used specifically to hide abuse? I was â€œhomeschooledâ€ because I was kicked out of a Christian high school for being gay and instead of simply transferring me to another school my mom took me out of school completely and made me raise my six younger siblings for years on end and all my siblings went to school except for me. I was wondering if anyone else has a similar experience? Thank you very much!
CPTSD,No thoughts or critical thinking can anyone help?,"Iâ€™ve realized I have a big problem right now I feel like an npc walking around with none of my thoughts and no critical thinking in my life. I canâ€™t make or hold friends because I canâ€™t hold conversations and I feel like Iâ€™m living on autopilot.
The people I talk to can seemingly make observations and comments but I canâ€™t do anything and my head is just blank and I have to put in so much effort to eek out any thought at all. Even when scrolling Reddit and stopping at a post, I have nothing to say about it and canâ€™t get myself to say anything while everyone else has things to contribute or say about the topic Iâ€™m just staring blank.

For example:
The elevator was broken and a dude said: My biggest fear is that itâ€™s broken foreverâ€¦ 


Does anyone have a solution to this? I asked my therapist and they donâ€™t really know either and Iâ€™m feeling hopeless about it.
I canâ€™t connect to anyone about anything and I feel like my brain is mush"
CPTSD,I had enough of trolls.,"Online trolls just never leave me alone. They come out when unexpected.

I was just casually watching YouTube when all of a sudden i got a notification from Reddit about a troll replying to my posts that i ""faked my PTSD for clout"" and i was not being abused but mildly disciplined. That troll even went as far as to dox me and when replying to positive comments of my posts, he started claiming that he ""knows me irl and knows that i lie a lot."" 

This is just plain garbage. I am 100% honest and never lie about my PTSD. Second, this person is just a stranger i never met before even online and this guy just wanted to waste his time ruining my rep. He blocked me so i cannot reply to his comments of my posts. 

When i managed to contact the troll on Discord, he just roasted me for no reason and said that i am a pussy and blocked me there too. Then this ended.

I am still stressed about the troll. But i can hopefully report him to the sub's mods and get his comments removed.

No one deserves to be trolled â™¥ï¸"
CPTSD,I think i found the main reason for my self hatred,"Few days ago my mom made me coffee (after i asked her to) and she shuved it in my face and said go ahead drink it with the most disgusted Face looking at me. All of a sadden all the feeling of shame self blame and hatred of myself come rushing in, and i feel like i found their source. 
It sits very deep in every thing i do or act, like have shallow relationships cuz im scared ppl will know the real me and hate it.
So in a way its good, to understand where it comes from (up until now it was kind of a blare but i knew its cuz of my mom)
So what do i do from here? Any advice? Any of you guys experience something similar?"
CPTSD,Long-distance friend self-isolating... Caring or overbearing?,"A long-distance friend/significant other that I recently visited totally deactivated and self-isolated after I left. Mutual friends haven't heard from him either. This is not the first time he's ""ghosted"" (and he's kinda known for it in the gaming-circle we belong to). I kinda felt it coming on, I think, and was... less than sensitive about his pulling away, in a bout of my own anxiety around abandonment.

I have apologized for this, but gotten no response. Based on what he's told me about his ""black moods"" (where he isolates from everything except work) and his childhood, and experience with other loved ones who suffer with CPTSD, I'm reasonably certain that this is CPTSD in action (though he's never labeled it as such). Hopefully this doesn't overstep the ""no diagnosing"" rule.

So here's the situation -- I have his address. I'm fairly sure he is not taking care of his physical needs (he forgets to eat even when he's not in a funk), and I'd like to send him some groceries or something. Low-effort snacks that I know he enjoys. No like.. response necessary, but just a ""hey I'm thinking of you"" kind of gesture. I don't want him to feel indebted or pressured to respond... just reassured that he didn't ""ruin"" things and that I care about his wellbeing and haven't abandoned him.

His previous gf used to trample his boundaries -- call him and text him obsessively, fuck with his family and his work, so I'm not sure how he might respond to this intrusion on my part. I also don't want him to feel unsafe. Do I take the no-response for a ""fuck off"" and just respect his desire for space until he tells me otherwise? Any insights? I realize nobody can read his mind, but your take is much appreciated <3 Sorry for the neurotic novel!

CPTSD,[Trigger Warning] Missing an abuser,"As soon as I got a decent job I threw myself into my work so I could avoid being at home.  Turned out it was too good to be true and my boss was behaving inappropriately and creepily towards me.  Parents told me I could leave and everything would be fine.  Well a month into that and I regret quitting so fucking bad.  I know it isn't healthy but god damn at least my boss actually liked me.  Getting my parents to talk to me or even pay me any attention at all is like pulling teeth.  It makes me feel like a child to say I want attention but it's better than sitting in my room all day and going unnoticed.  


I hate feeling like this.  My boss was possessive and controlling but at least I could tell that he cared about me.  Even when he was mad at me he'd sprinkle in something to make me feel better so he could keep dragging me along.  Even negative attention was better than this.   I don't feel as stressed out as when I was working there but I'm so lonely it might as well not matter.  


It's gotten so bad that it's making me want to call my boss.  He wanted to keep in touch after I left and he kept calling my mom to get to me.  Called me a few days before Christmas on Christmas then texted me on New years.  It creeped me out and it still does but at least I was on someone's mind.  I just miss him so much.  Even when he was being a huge ass to me.  I feel like it's effecting me more than it should.  I only worked there like 7 or 8 months and it's turned me into a huge fucking mess.  


I don't know.  I just miss feeling like someone actually wanted me.  Even if it was a wrong kind of want.  Even when I could tell he was trying to manipulate me.  At least he cared enough to try."
CPTSD,trauma focused therapy,"Iâ€™ve got my first trauma focused therapy session tomorrow morning. iâ€™m really scared, but i know itâ€™s for the best.

CPTSD,Question for People Doing Intensive Trauma Work,"Do you have a good support network outside of the therapist or person you are working with? What does that look like? Can you describe practically how it helps when shit hits the fan? I have so many blocks to actually perceiving and receiving support that I'm considering very non-conventional approaches. If I'm going to kick a hornets nest, I want to feel like there is some point of external social contact or a place of physical safety I can reside in, and I don't think there is. Are there any of you that are finding success on your own/with your alternative program outside of traditional therapy? I think success is relative, so by ""are you finding success"" I mean for you personally and I'm curious what your metrics are."

Currently, my partner is grappling with unemployment and depression. How does the idea of ""putting on one's face mask first"" apply in this situation?"
CPTSD,I keep shutting down.,"I know the science behind it.  I was told it was a trauma response and my nervous system going into a freeze state or something like that.  Canâ€™t think clearly right now.  I was told moving around would help.  Bilateral movements, music, and other stimuli to help proccess.
I donâ€™t have it in me to fix myself.

Iâ€™m so tired of pulling myself back up and keeping on appearances for what seems like nothing.  Sure my life is better than it was, and â€œI have so much to live forâ€.  I know Iâ€™ve made progress but I want to give up, and I want someone else to help carry the load because Iâ€™m not strong enough, and Iâ€™m tired of having to act like I am.  Iâ€™m not.

Iâ€™m tired of feeling alone.  Iâ€™m tired of feeling scared.  I wish someone would help.

Once I was told that depression was like drowning with everyone around you knowing how to swim.  It was so accurate.
Well healing is like learning to tread water but in the deep end.  Itâ€™s exhausting, and sure itâ€™ll get better with practice but I canâ€™t keep this ip forever.

CPTSD,Annual Review and Trauma,"Itâ€™s annual review season, and Iâ€™m wondering how people cope with writing and receiving their reviews, especially when they havenâ€™t had a stellar year? I have so much trauma around being judged by people in positions of authority that I just lock up when it comes time to write them. The last 3 years werenâ€™t as bad because even I knew that I had kicked a ton of ass and gone far above and beyond, so it was a lot easier to muster the self-esteem to write a good review. However, this year was tough. I wouldnâ€™t say I did bad, but there are a few projects where I know I fell short, and thatâ€™s all I can think of. It sends me into a difficult shame spiral, and I canâ€™t find the words to puff myself up because I donâ€™t feel great about it. I know where I could have improved, but some of it was also dealing with another extremely toxic person that spent 3 months triggering me to the point that I had a massive panic attack  but you canâ€™t talk about these things in a review. You have to make yourself sound amazing, and humble enough to admit your mistakes and how youâ€™ll improve in the next yearâ€¦ and like, Iâ€™ve been working really hard on myself to learn how to not become triggered by toxic people, you still canâ€™t say thisâ€¦

So yeah, I guess Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else experiences this during their annual review, and if you have any tips or tricks for overcoming the shame/fear cycle."
CPTSD,Not healing anymore,"
I've healed quite a lot through therapy and emdr.
No longer in a complete state of dissociative madness.  But for past few months  ive just been stuck, depressed and generally disconnected in this disconnected state of anhedonia, where nothing motivates me, i cant think of the future positively, having a really hard time getting up .

It's been months of this. I want to get better. My girlfriends constant pressure and unhapiness is not helping at all.

Anyone else feel like they hit some sort of plateau after a lot of intense healing and realizations symptoms have calmed down? Now im just generally unhappy and stuck ? I don't know what other steps to take."
CPTSD,Youâ€™re a problem,Youâ€™re a problem when youâ€™re healing or healed because youâ€™re not just going to allow anyone to treat you a certain way. Youâ€™re more aware of manipulations and motives and can smell a lack of honesty and genuine care and love. If youâ€™re a problem cause you oppose garbage and being used..  GOOD FOR YOU!!

CPTSD,They're all the same type of abuser.,"I've noticed a lot recently that a lot of the advice stemming towards abusive partners in relationships fits abusive parents during childhood, abusive bosses at work, manipulative friends you keep, etc. Like, the language might be different, but at the core it's all the same. They disrespect you on purpose because they know they can get away with it, and don't respect you as a person. I don't know why this is so fascinating to me haha, but am I wrong? That they're all the same type of person with the same type of core issue?"
CPTSD,I'm just so tired and depressed. I want nothing more than to kill myself.,"Word vomit ahead. Rant ahead. Call it whatever. Just don't expect it to make sense. Feel free to skip it. 



I'm just so tired. I have no purpose in life. I have no ""loving'' family to count upon. My literal priority right now is to get away from my fucking family and never speak a word to any of them ever again. I have more hatred for them than my heart is physically capable of carrying. 



Look at me, breaking all psychics limits. 



I'm just so tired and depressed. It's incredibly hard living with PTSD. One song, one scent, one bad dream and you're back at the bottom. I'm so broken. And meanwhile, nobody even understands my struggles. I don't blame them, it's not something(s) many people go through. I'd even go as far as to say that out of the 8 billion, I might be one of the tens who've experienced the life I've had so far. 




I'm just. So broken. I try to be a functional human being but I just....can't. I cannot. My brain is stuck in a survival state. I feel like I've reversed back to our ancestors, constantly checking out my surroundings for danger, dissecting people's characters to determine if they're genuine or if they've going to hurt me. Hypervigilance goes to an extreme level for me. 



I try to be happy but I can't. Almost all of the times I'm content with being alone, but every so often I just can't handle it. I feel a physical void, a hole, right where my heart is due to the isolation and the traumatic memories. 



I did not deserve to get given this life. I DID NOT FUCKING DESERVE IT. I just want to kill myself. Maybe get a pocket knife and go vertically. Or horizontally just to cause myself more agony. Get a strong rope and tie a quick knot, find somewhere stable to hang it from. Get drunk and throw myself off a place high enough. Or maybe even just drown myself, at least I live next to a huge river. I've even thought and actively wanted to slice my veins with my nails. I don't know anymore. I just want it to end. It's not a life I wanna live. It's broken. It's destroyed. Nothing can fix it. Trust me. Nothing can FUCKING fix it. I can get a glimpse of joy only when under the influence. I just want it to end. I'm not sure I care anymore about what happens to my soul when I die. Throw me in a conscious black void for eternity for all I care. 




It'd be an oasis compared to this. I just want to end it already so badly"
CPTSD,Realizing that I lived my whole life without a sense of safety,"Slowly realizing that what I lack is a sense of safety. With this realization, it feels like lots of puzzle pieces of my internal chaos are being matched. 

It explains my bad startle reaction that I have had my whole life; when I am in public places like coffeshops, there is no way I can sit somewhere where someone would come from behind, I always make sure to have a wall behind me and have full vision of everyone. 

It explains why when in the slightest bits of where I have to assert myself, I get a scared look on my face. One example of this that comes to my mind was one time when I went inside of a cab with a friend and the driver misunderstood our destination and I had to correct him, my friend laughed and said: ""oh you were so scared!"" I asked what did she meant, and she told me that I had a scared look on my face. I could not understand what she meant because that was just my face, I was not aware of my scared face. 

I got this remark here and there throught my life and I could not understand it, because I would be having my normal face on and out of no where someone would snarkly make the remark that I look so scared. 

I did a presentation in school once and my classmate made a remark after, she said you looked weird there. I asked how, she said verbatim: ""You looked like a scared child"".

My sister told me that whenever we are outside and if someone stops me to ask me for directions or something, I get so startled and I get a scared face.

In the past, I felt intense shame when all those remarks were made to me and I tried my best to forget them. 

I have also always felt a difference between me and the calm serene people. I felt the difference, but because I was so high on cortisol, I could not comprehend that I was on survival mode and that I percieved the world as DANGER. 

Speaking of cortisol, I am 26 and I am losing my hair and 25% of it is already white hair. It saddens me. The phrase of "" the body keeps the score"" is hitting me right now. 

Ironically, I am scared now.  I am scared of not making it out of these patterns. I am scared of not being able to heal myself and go on and lead a normal life, I am so terrified.

But let me celebrate this epiphany! I found out that I lost my sense of safety in this world, and I do not feel ashamed of what that made me do in the past. All of this means that if I treat myself a certain way and if I do certain things daily, I can build a sense of safety. What would that be? I do not know yet, but I hope I can figure it out.

CPTSD,"To those who went NC with several people, how did you plan it/execute it?","I went NC with my dad in the middle of last year and now I realize I need to go NC with some extended family members.

With my dad, it was a lot easier because he's not part of the family (parents are divorced) and there are no extended family within proximity that keep in touch with him. Cutting him out of my life was simple, and my immediate family understands.

The extended family that I have that do live in the same state as me, is where it gets tricky. I am close to some, but others I am not. Has anyone been in similar circumstances? What did you end up doing?"

CPTSD,Gaslit both ways lmao?,"So. I realized, this girl calling me a homophobe, when I never uttered a direct remark to anyone, said I ""gaslit"" her, for saying I DIDNT do anything homophobic, essentially I said ""this is wierd, I'm unconfortable, I'm gonna look here"" apparently in conversation after she first came out to me and another friend... She is not my fucking friend, anymore now. Anyway, I remember how I was between her, and the other girl, saying ""I'm uncomfortable/feel wierd looking between you two, I'm gonna look in the middle/other there\[?\] "" (that's what I did in group convos in my young teen days). Now it fucking sucks, as I type this I see how she ""misinterpreted"" me. Well, this was when I was 13 right, from 13 untill now nearly 19 I've always been confused about her and doubted myself. Felt 'gaslit'.

Anyway in context though whatever I said I literally never meant to reject her, and never remember it, and dont remember feeling it, and don't remember her being rude back, however, she was randomly rude, as the start of her random hostile attitude, but at the end of the meet, saying I should cope with her woman fashion shopping.

Also, I was literally just inbetween them, not part of the convo really maybe a bit, but she must've chose if she genuinely believed it to hear me muttering (not directly to anyone) after her coming out revelationing chat or during that I said ""this is wierd I'm gonna look over here"". She has like anger issues I'd think, but everyone see's her as a 'passionate' nice person. But didn't want to say much to me, was more interested in her friend who is a girl, probably reassuring her that she isn't interested in fucking, and also other way that being gay is cool I accept you dear friend, when I was really silent and not adding anything just being the male of the group.. well I wasn't interested in 'making a big deal/ not sure how to say it honestly enough../praising her for the existence of her gayness? I only said anything I can remember tbf about it with these people when it was just me and the non-lesbo, I said if she was a masculine woman- as being gay, in a non judgy way.

So maybe I'm missing pieces and stuff...

Well, whatever you take from that, I'll add vague details that can't accurately describe the whole situation back then...

She ran away from me first day of school, bit less than 3 months from her pride month where she came out. She actually ran, at school. I never got her to explain it, I brought it up twice tho I believe not like a fucking bitch like her would be honest and pretend nothing even happened? Oh fuck well atleast this is definitely gasliting. She did say multiple times that she never ran, the two times I asked, \*first day of school\*... Nope never did nothing ðŸ¤£ suck ur suicidal thoughts that we used to talk on x ðŸ‘ that's actually her, she kept having to use that emoji in our last convo cause she couldn't back herself up..

Context police: in June of 2018 she came out as gay, in September she ran from me \*%)\* ha look at that emoji lol he look like me after her shit... In 2019 I stood up before the last school term (oh June almost aswell lol) and had an angry chat with her, never had done, ever.. I was making her cry via text ðŸ¤£ sorry but if u call me a homophobe and cry cause I expose u and ask if u even have time to talk .. she made a point it was a Sunday evening lol but I said if she could talk... If I came up on the street, harrassed her that wouldn't be great.. but I said I'd like to talk if she had the time... On text... That's so fucking respectful even though I have a lot I need to address and am NOT happy. Her friend is also anal and didn't tell her apparently that I didn't mind her gayness, I actually think I remember specifically saying I was fine with her gayness... On that first day, to the non-lesbo. Also texted her saying ""we need to break the ice"" and talked about the incident in the halls on Year 9 day 1, denied it, Christmas December time I texted 2018.

I told her I liked her in February 2018.

More deets (I'll cut this off now vigilant unnecessarily-long-post traverser) : I had feelings too before we stopped talking properly, it was like we could still be friends? I was just so happy to talk to her, but suddenly things between us were dead or something? Before she came out in early 2018. She probably was uncomfortable with me, and maybe thought of me as wierd, and this is what I don't like, she seemed to distance herself along with everyone else essentially, not as a group idk I haven't slept sorry. I tried fixing things by messaging her, she said stop messaging me I have Anxiety (gad). She I think said ""oh no things are fine I'm happy to talk to you"" but Idk maybe I just didn't talk enough irl but, she didn't help at all cause I said I had issues and, specifically, S.A.D so I wasn't talking as much but I didn't have classes with her so I met her at lunch but that was it, I swear I did make an effort to talk, I remember again mid post writing I was hanging out with her a bit and other friends, being,.. her friend? But , despite meeting a few times in summer with people in September she sprinted and fucked my confidence as a whole in half and now I'm jittery everywhere and I don't even know what should make me jittery, a bad, general opinion doesn't deserve my body's fucking jitters fucking mind.

Anyways. Enough of all this. I need to get the whole kicker here ðŸ¤  ! I made myself a homophobe for saying the word wierd at bad timing, but, I texted a few hours later to say I was cool with her being gay as I knew she wanted reassurance, and guess what? YOURE MAKING A BIG DEAL OF IT (reference first part of post) so... Yeah.. I'm a homophobe, though I texted you saying how good it is pretty much forcibly and after cycling up just to hear really that you like women, I can't make a thing of this thing you are definetly making a thing of I think (sorry- boredomðŸ˜†)so I can't make it an important matter, it's patronising and evil and exaggerating how much it matters in general and to her is the general idea of what she said in response ""big deal of it"" is included somewhere if I have misinterpreted her but she did like genuinely put me down, like I felt like bad just to be friendly on her gayness? And like, I don't know if my attitude was like that 'too friendly pretending she cares more than actual about a subject matter' like someone trying to have power when u don't care. But rant/story/ fucked up historys over.

I'm insecure about the gaslit thing. We are BOTH gasliting each other (but she is the liar lmao) cause I say ""you ran, and I never said being GAY is wierd at all not even to you or to non-lesbo"" she says ""I never ran. You said you were uncomfortable and it was wierd as soon as I came out, and you're an evil person, and, uh, homophobe hehe xd ruin your school reputation whilst u have social anxiety?""

Hey yeah I don't talk now to him cause ""*Matthew pushed me away- when I came out as a lesbian*""... Definetly more, but atleast I can quote it actually 95% accurate lol tho someone else told me this...not even fucking bitch ass... You never fucking texted, I texted 1 week before school finally in ages since I can't text or it's harrassing your anxiety issues, we have a nice convo. Well uh not at school 1 week later when you run from me in the language halls you... :( why? Sorry I have badly needed to make a post, just a long good post about this 2 year period I knew this girl. From 2017-2019 in total.

Shit if she is on this subreddit leave you can talk to me about this elsewhere please and I have no clue what I think of you now, the past wasn't great, at all fucking piece of shit running my life making me wanna die \*leave now lol I don't care talking like this\* ....

Anyways. So, I could keep ranting but I'm tired. I just need to say one last knowledge bomb piece.. *closes opens eyes* I thought this girl was fit. As fuck.. I looked at her quite a lot, but I always looked at girls, but now there was an obsession with her body. Which replaced my obsession with a good, emotionally open friend in my life for once. So I looked at her. But if she said stop I would stop(didn't happen)... Idk I mean I admit I went out of my way to look at girls pervily in my younger-mid teen years and I was DOWN BAD for just like, a girls lower half in tight clothing.. and I looked up skirts a shit ton. I didn't have any relationship when I was 11-12.5 with my father, I see that as a reason I was such a creep... And bullying cause I couldn't talk with girls cause they all picked on me/ felt too wierd to talk to a girl as a person I think. I started puberty like half a year ish before I couldn't talk to my pa. (Legally no contact allowed.. not a criminal, Fuck ss). This has deleted a few empathetic, warm to the heart, comments... I mean the girl was annoyed with me one or two occasions, it seemed, seemed she was tryna hide her body from me ect but never said anything, and so she now probably uses this to further her claim people should treat me bad cause I swear I did nothing wrong from 2019-2023 but people from my school know me as not quiet finally... But don't like me. But some think I'm cool. But don't even wanna be friends.. cause I was a creep I mean, I had respect I think? Hard to be when ur a two faced fucking ----- I looked alot yeah but I tried to be discreet, I mean it was only if she was there available to look, also sorry if I sound creepy, I would perv if told not, but if you got a hot steaming roll of a bod, someone will look if nature intended that body to advertise your life goal of continuing the generation... That was her basically... Sorry.. if she was reading this again don't wanna be a creep I'm just horny lmao.

Dont say her rudeness was cause I liked her ass. Please don't pick that out of everything...

But yeah it's funny we are both apparently gasliting each other omg couple goals right ðŸ˜‚ (I laved her)but I miss her. Now is the better bit for her, so to be fair on her .. We met cause she was doing a summer camp activity week that I did, we were close as soon as we met pretty much, she was beautiful, I didn't look at her at all now, cause I thought this sexualization was wrong.. I saw her jeaned behind and thought how wierd and uninterested I am at looking at my friends area in jeans... Only once we weren't really friends did I look. She was like a female version of me, someone else said we were a good match, she was smart and funny and like real? Like, I became introverted because I loved her looking like that ? Introversion=real somehow lol but when she left one the last day.. I missed her ðŸ¥² couldn't say bye. I talked with her about how ""I don't know if I can keep going"" well ok that I think was the most immediate suicidal statement, but I think I must've talked about suicide alot, atleast alot of mental health we talked about like every day and I hadn't had a good friend before like this... I got supported by her though, so much it felt like, we did homework at a cafe and didn't meet again sadly just us two but it was mainly really just text convos are friendship was and seeing each other at school but I was less talkative then, I got more talkative in the summer when I wasn't talking to her, I sorta said ah fuck it's summer I'll forget the situation.

Anyway I need to sleep this post took 30+ mins I need to eat before it's too late and let myself starve again... Appreciate all response. As long as it's not ""she was creeped by your pervieness"" otherwise... I'm sensitive about this, don't be arrogant or I might sound 'hostile' I sound like that people say on reddit I don't death threat so I don't see where ""hostile"" comes in? Anyways. Cheers.

\*TLDR;\* my ex closest friend was gasliting me, and saying I gaslit her, but I think else too so we basically are gasliting each other now by just confidently thinking we are the right one here ðŸ˜‚ she is the wrong one. ðŸ¤£ I never said she gaslit me, I just told her what she did to me. She said I gaslit her. She told me what I don't remember doing at the apparent juncture (gay reveal) so she's gasliting me to think I did this. How could she possibly believe (and is it possibly accidental/purposefully sloppily accident gasliting on her end somehow?) that I genuinely didn't accept her being gay and didn't like her as she was gay? I actually said I accepted her on text, so re readable and she called me homophobe.

Also I did look at her but she had nice outfits I wasn't wanting to be rudely hetro to her but then I didn't feel motivated if it meant anything to respect her after her random abandonment trauma she gave me in the hallways in 2018? No imma perv yeah but I mean I just liked how she looked it wasn't malicious it wouldn't benefit me to maliciously perv someone cause I'm mad at em... It was fucked. But you could easily say I'm a bit fucked to perv on a lesbian for a school year... So I might not have the high ground ðŸ˜¬ but I am sure I'm the victim, not just the one who did fucked things/complicated things she did that a ton more..

TLDR- just above the paragraph above this text."
CPTSD,"The best part of ""Oppenheimer"" is when he realizes that he's a bad parent","The movie is a biopic about  J. Robert Oppenheimer. He created the first atomic bomb, and he had a lot of personal struggles.

In one scene, he comes home to find that his newborn baby is crying and his wife is just sitting in another room, clearly doing nothing about it. He says ""Shouldn't you go to him?"" and she says ""I've been going to him all day!"" and drinks some alcohol.

So Oppenheimer *takes his baby to his friend's house* and asks *his friend and his friend's wife* to take care of the baby. Oppenheimer explains that he and his wife are shit parents and their son deserves better than this.

WOW.

Just imagine if bad parents were self-aware like this. Imagine if they reached out to healthy friends like this. Imagine if it was more normalized to take in someone else's child as your own. Even if it's just a temporary thing, a once-in-awhile thing, it could potentially have hugely positive impacts.

Note that Oppenheimer *never* blames the kid in any way. He doesn't treat his son as an annoyance to be gotten rid of. He treats his son as a human being who needs love and support and he recognizes his own (and his wife's) inability to provide that love and support, so he set things up so the kid will *get the love and support he needs*.

What a concept!

*sigh*"
CPTSD,Can someone explain to me what dysregulation is in simple terms,I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going through is actually called dysregulation and ironically it dysregulates me
CPTSD,Really triggered causing me to self harm- sex,I was SA but my step cousin as a child. He is now 32 and recently he came to my aunts house when I was there. I went into panic mode and locked myself in the toilet. Since then Iâ€™ve been sleeping with random guys repeatedly. I have really important exams coming up but I havenâ€™t prepared at all. Iâ€™ve slept with 5 guys off dating apps in the past two week. Itâ€™s getting worse as I need sex constantly otherwise I canâ€™t cope. What shall I do. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy. Iâ€™m going to bring this up with my therapist in our next session but Iâ€™m so ashamed
CPTSD,What is this feeling?,"I was talking with my therapist the other day and had trouble explaining myself. I've been depressed for a couple months. Like no appetite, low energy, weight loss depressed, not crying all the time depressed. She noted my mood has been low and I agreed, adding that I've been feeling kinda flat. But later in the session she pointed out moments in our conversation that I expressed feeling sad or anxious. I'm not sure I was actually feeling that way though. It was like my body was acting sad and anxious but I wasn't really feeling anything. Often it's like I feel without feeling, like I'm somehow wired to be sad or anxious even when I'm not anything at all. 

Anyone have insight on what could be going on here?"
CPTSD,I think I only can get in abusive relantionships,Does it happen to you? I now prefer to be alone. I only have gotten toxic and abusive friendships and boyfriends. I prefer being alone. I crave affection but I'm afraid of people.
CPTSD,Foster care,I find it crazy how they can deem foster care parents as none abusive when you tell them that youâ€™re being abused. They do an investigation which is all talking. How do they know who teeling the truth and whoâ€™s not with 0 cameras? Itâ€™s so sad how these investigators take the side of the foster parents instead of the childâ€™s. Like why would a child waste their time telling in detail whatâ€™s happening to them if it wasnâ€™t true.
CPTSD,Just found out my brother abused me / Can I still be a therapist myself?,"Iâ€˜m 24 now and I just finished my bachelor in Psychology. I loved studying psychology and even if I did struggle mentally in my early 20 (who doesnâ€™t?) I was really happy the last years with my studies, my hobbies and my health relationship. But like 6 months ago I kinda fell into a depressive hole. It started with a visit a my parents house where I found my self unable to speek anymore and endet with a vacation with my family and suicidal thoughts. 
I turned to my parents for help but they didnâ€™t wanted me to seek help and kinda just get myself together. 
I did seek help and found out threw therapy that the bullying and physical abuse from my brother wasnâ€™t normal like my mom always said. I was always framed as being overdramatic. Also I donâ€™t really remember most of my childhood, only bits or more how I felt but not why). Now I still go to therapy and struggle between feeling like an attentionseeking Dramaqueen or an actual victim of abuse and neglect by my parents. Itâ€™s so hart to really validate that I was abused. Something in me always things Nahh your parents tried your best and they said it was nothing crazy and even if your brother is still awful now (heâ€™s 26 now and my bf for example even calld him a narcissist bevor I even starrt therapy) he just wants the best for you, but canâ€™t act like it. 

Also I always wanted to become a therapist my self and now I donâ€™t know if I should go on with that because of my own struggles."
CPTSD,Whatever you do donâ€™t fall into a victim identity,"I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything as corrosive as indulging a victimhood stance. 

Before long I went from feeling sorry for myself to identifying as a victim within my own narrative plot. 

I have become intoxicated with â€˜how people have crossed meâ€™ and a desire for vengeance. 

Itâ€™s easy to come up with injusticesâ€¦ â€˜oh the government!â€™ â€˜oh my landlord!â€™, â€˜if only them over there!â€™, â€˜had I never wasted my time on that ex!â€™â€¦ The list can go on and on but it does nothing. 

If I could give my advice it would be to spot signs that you are mentally meandering down this path and instantly snap out of it and do something to make the lives of you and those around you somewhat better. You may not like your life (thereâ€™s a high chance you donâ€™t if youâ€™re experiencing constant pain) however own and accept responsibility for you. 

Visioning yourself as â€˜a victimâ€™ or â€˜the victimâ€™ is probably the most destructive psychological deceit that can be engaged in and only leads to more misery. Pain has a way of breaking down the boundaries of joy and stuffing you full of misery, I would say donâ€™t let it. Despite the pain do something beyond it which puts you back in control. 

Also rigorously protect your boundaries. You canâ€™t afford to have negative energy around you when youâ€™re in recovery or to be putting  negative out thereâ€¦ You need to preserve your strength or youâ€™ll be in the same place and worse 5 years from now.

Hope this posts helps someone and saves them some time on their recovery :)

Itâ€™s easy to slip into this frame of mind when youâ€™ve had one bad experiences after another or your focus has shifted to only recognise the negative. It creeps up on you casually and gradually infects the mind. You have my compassion if you too are struggling. 

Anyway thought Iâ€™d share, maybe it may help someone, certainly helps me in recognising it in myself and catching it. "
CPTSD,Am I wrong for being irritatated? This feels like a small trigger yet it bothers me so much,"I can't tell if I'm overreacting but I loathe being told how I feel by someone else. Can you all here tell me if I'm wrong?

TL:DR Mom tells me I'm tired because I ""don't want to clean"". It put me in a bad mood because that's not true, im genuinely tired due insomnia that she has literally commented on just yesterday. On top of that, she complimented me last week for keeping the house clean and washing the dishes multiple times a day. So why would I suddenly be tired because of dishes this week? 

For context, my bro cooked some food and I said I would wash the dishes after. But, ive been dealing with really bad insomnia so I wake up late or I stay up all day then become tired too early. Today was the latter.

I couldn't even finish my food, I fell asleep with it next to me. My mom accidentally woke me up, which was okay because I was facing a wall and she didn't know I was sleep (I was eating on my bed, bad habit I know haha). She said what she needed to say and walked off. 

She came back and asked me if I was still going to wash the dishes. I said yes and I just wanted to take a nap first. She told me to wrap up my food and make sure I eat. Fair enough. I did that and while I was at it I began bringing dishes from my room and around the house to the kitchen so everything is in place when I wake up. 

While I'm doing this my mom offers me caffeine pills (which is also annoying because she scolds me for drinking coffee saying I don't need caffeine but then she offers me it??) . I said no thanks. Then she tells me she thinks I'm tired because I don't want to wash the dishes. And this just put me in a bad mood because all last week I continuosly washed EVERYONE'S dishes everyday multiple times because I didn't want them to stack up. 

My nephews came over for the weekend and I ended up not washing them because I got overwhelmed by the kids (not just that but my brother said he would wash them and didn't wash the last batch before he left). So they stacked up again. 

So not only am I irritated that I have to clean the dishes I was told would be washed, I don't like being told how I feel and why. Especially when I was constantly told I'm lazy as a child when it turned out to be undiagnosed adhd. 

Lately I've been trying my best to stay on top of all of the chores because I feel like I'm the only one who gets called out for not cleaning despite basically being the ONLY one who cleans in my house (which is whatever because I don't work right now but this has been happening since I was a minor). 

I don't want to be the jerk that uses adhd as an excuse. My mom even applauded me last week for keeping everything clean. I told her I'm not tired because of the dishes and I'm not trying to use it as an excuse or anything I'm just tired from poor sleep. 

She back tracked and said she's ""just joking"". Well it didn't feel like a joke. I don't understand what was funny. I'm already tired and cranky because of it, she keeps talking when I just want to sleep, and then that remark has me really frustrated. 

Am I wrong here for being annoyed?"
CPTSD,Book Recommendation,"""Complex CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" by Pete Walker. So far very good and helpfully outlines the various ways CPTSD impacts our lives. 

For fellow people of color: I am also picking up ""My Grandmother's Hands"" by Resmaa Menakem.  It is about racialized trauma which is often deeply intertwined with our cptsd. I'm hoping it helps me heal and overcome the pain I experience from my family.

If you have a helpful book please lmk. "
CPTSD,Setbacks,"Iâ€™ve been doing well for a while, but since this past Friday itâ€™s been a struggle. Iâ€™m getting married soon. I thinks itâ€™s just a lot of change, decisions, and pressure all at once. Iâ€™m marrying a great guy and Iâ€™m so thankful for him. I know Iâ€™ve been blessed. I had a bad meltdown on Friday and Saturday. On Saturday I hid in my closet and couldnâ€™t stop crying. I wanted to drink myself into oblivion and hit myself just to make the emotional overload stop. I can feel myself reverting and wanting to hide. Setbacks are frustrating."
CPTSD,Emotional numbness and release,"Hi guys! I normally lurk here and the posts here motivate me a lot in my healing journey. I've been emotionally numb for 10+ years due to my CPTSD and for the longest time I thought that this was just how humans felt in general and that there was nothing to worry about. I've recently discovered that I've emotionally numbed myself as a defensive response to neglect and for the longest time I felt like I was a spectator in my life rather than a participant in it. So I keep asking myself, how does emotional release feel like, especially for someone that pent up their emotions for the longest time. I genuinely want to release my emotions to be a full on person again but I'm also terrified of how that would feel. So for the people that numbed their emotions for a long period like me and released them, how does it feel? "
CPTSD,Mom why?,"So recently my mom found out about the csa I went through with my step dad  for about 6 to 8 years.
She cried about me not trusting her enough to tell her.
She complained about how her life would have been better if I had told her when it happened. 
I have been slowly telling her of the things that happened. But I feel like she only cares about why I didn't tell her sooner. 
I told her that I believed that she knew and did nothing. She started crying.
I was hoping for something.   Understanding? Comfort maybe? 

How can I make her see?"
CPTSD,why are people lying about life? a pathetic and empty life is not worth having,"I wish people would stop pretending like it's not the case. they wouldn't want to live like that, and they don't even have enough compassion to admit that not all of us get equal abilities/opportunities.

wish I was born at a time where I wouldn't survive past first 10 days of my life. nature knows what it's doing, humans don't. "
CPTSD,How do you accomplish work while healing?,"Hi everyone! Newly diagnosed here so reeling a bit and trying to find a therapist still. I'm 37F and had done therapy since age 12 for MDD and GAD, but apparently that wasn't adequate even when I stated, for years, techniques don't always help. Now I'm looking to address the trauma (even though I don't want to) so I can heal and head towards happiness etc. The problem is work... I'm a supervisor for an insurance company, so it's always busy. My ability has absolutely tanked since learning of my diagnosis, which was somehow triggering. How do you heal and hold down a job at the same time?! Most of the time I'm stuck crying unable to do anything.

Edit - I should add that I have a special needs almost 9 year old daughter, so there is scarcely time for myself. Between work, taking her to her activities, and trying to wife/hold down a house, it's near impossible to get away. "
CPTSD,Traumatized by Tragedy,"My mother had cancer since before I was born. All she ever wanted was a family, which I find touching as an adult now (23). I struggle with the complex guilt I have now. 

She was depressed and couldnâ€™t leave her bed most of the time growing up. I always accounted it to her brain tumor impacting her motor skills. I understood that as a young kid that she was getting more and more ill. 

However, after her third round of chemotherapy she became bedridden. I would go to her bedside hoping that she would get up. But she never wanted to.

She was deeply depressed that she dying and many of her friends stopped contacting her. I canâ€™t stop thinking about that pain.

Yes, I am upset that she never got to be there for me. She died when I was 10. But even before then, she was barely around for me.

I cannot help but feel depressed about that she couldnâ€™t be there, but I am especially upset that I understand why now.

I feel my deep sadness is something that I wear on my face. People have taken advantage of me for the fact that I try so hard to make them happy like I did for my mother.

She wasnâ€™t a narcissist or abusive. Just a very depressed woman. Now I feel it hurts me in my relationships. How can I end this cycle?"
CPTSD,I need an alternate perspective or advice,"Often times I find myself stuck inside my head instead of doing what I need to. I really want to launch a business and I have the means to do so but when it comes time to do shit I just lose motivation. Best example I can give is a brief description of yesterday. I got home from work and a couple errands to sit at my computer doing nothing. All day at work I was thinking about how I'm going to design product and escape being a wage slave but when I got home I just didn't. 

I started thinking about ""everything"" which usually involves my lack of money, surplus of debt, unfinished projects/tasks, how I'm going to make my future better, relationships, and how killing myself will solve everything instantly. Sometimes I disassociate or depersonalize and idek. 

I'm not in any danger, I just need to be able to function or break out of my head. Any comments are appreciated, godspeed"
CPTSD,how to not let this bother me,"so I used to live in a city that is a really popular tourist destination, but while I was there I went through months of some really traumatic stuff and ended up moving really far away. Itâ€™s been a year and a half now and Iâ€™ve been through a lot of therapy, but my partner, who I just met a year ago, is on a short vacation right now with family and theyâ€™re in that city and itâ€™s really fucking with my head. Thinking about it makes me sick and i donâ€™t know what I can do to make it not upset me so much. I havenâ€™t been back to that city since and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be ready to go back any time soon, but this is taking up all my headspace and i canâ€™t get out. Has anyone gone through something similar? Am I overreacting?"
CPTSD,I'm so tired,"Sometimes words aren't enough to adequately explain the pure mental pain i experience. Some days, (like today) I can't do anything but break down and cry. In that moment, years of repressed anguish and fear come flooding back. Just like back then, I feel powerless and out of control, and ive got nobody to seek comfort in.
It seems like everyone else can move on so easily, my parents think im just chosing to live in the past. Almost as if they expect me to be fine after a couple walks and other random, pointless distractions. As if im not mentlly ill AT ALL. As if they weren't the ones putting pressure on me to get over everything quickly, or else ill be just like my fucked up cousin that also chooses to live in the past.

I can't do that. Its not that easy. I feel haunted, tired. Most of my energy goes into maintaining my mask and holding on for dear life to what's left of my sanity. 
Every. Single. Day. Is spent trying to silence my mind. Trying to purge those images and thoughts. Trying not to lash out and control my emotions (dont want to be like my parents). Trying to ground myself in reality. Convincing myself that I'm truly safe. Every. single. Day. 
I notice that my jaw is sore from clenching so much. Every day I feel the tension throughout my entire body. I get stomach cramps, and headaches, and sometimes it feels as if I can't breathe. I'm always switched on, always on edge, always managing some thing or another.
I've tried going for walks, and I've tried distractions. I've tried just being happy and not being negative - changing my mindset. I still try all of that, but nobody around me seems to get that it's deeper than that. I'm genuinely mentally fucked up and I don't choose to be this way. No matter how much I repress, or confront, or manage I'm still left feeling broken. At the end of it all im still left with these fucked head images and this insane emotional rollercoasters.

I'm still waiting on therapy to no avail. I called a helpline, just for them to advise that I numb myself to get through the day. I can't turn to family because they've caused this shit in the first place, and my friends and bf aren't going to want to hear about how fucked up in the head I am 24/7.

I've been suicidal for years, and today is the first time that I've truly acknowledged it. The reasonable side of me says to take things day by day, and that this pain won't last....

But fuck me, sometimes I want to sleep forever! This shit is exhausting. Atleast then I wouldn't have to feel shit for god knows how long.

I'm just so tired of it all. I don't want to feel like this forever. I don't really want to die, but I'm so tired. I really want to make better memories to make up for my shitty past. Ending it all now ends the possibility of that becoming a reality 

I just feel so trapped in my own head and I doesn't feel like there's a way out."
CPTSD,Trust and sexual intimacy,"I (30F) have struggled with sex since my first experience, with a married guy twenty years older.

Penetration is difficult for me even when I crave it and my body is physically ready, it's as if my body collapsed and didn't allow it to happen. It hurts a lot, and even playing with my fingers feels uncomfortable. I have vaginismus.

It seems I've been sexually abused by my father in different ways and had a tough time in romantic relationships, mainly because I always ended up with unavailable people and relationships that contradicted what I believed to be my values, leaving me feeling hopeless and like a lost cause as I can't trust myself to be the adult of my life nor other people to give me the love and respect I give them.

The last relationship, while barely sexual, was romantic and I felt soul raped. I think that's the term that best describes it, even though I took an active role in it and hence have a lot of work to do.

All CPTSD-like symptoms are completely out of proportion in me and as a result I live in a state of hyperarousal with constant tachycardia, headaches and rejection to other people's company. I also struggle with suicidal thoughts and I truly hope I die young.

I've reached a point where being surrounded by masculine energy feels both uninteresting and dangerous - as I find women more attractive, mature and spiritual. I am bisexual. I just can't help but be aware that there is a high sexual component to it and many men have this in mind while interacting with women, it seems to be an override.

If I continue to feel like this, paralysed in bed and avoidant outside of it, I will lose out on some of the most beautiful things life has to offer.

I like to focus on my intellectual, professional and sport lives, as our minds, bodies and money is all we have to make it through life - people come and go; but I know what I'm doing.

I just expect people to hurt me and so I would rather be alone, which saves you the headache but also brings other problems.

I'd like to know if someone here experienced this and was able to make it through. If you haven't, maybe it's best to keep away from commenting as I wouldn't like this post to become a place where we incur in self-pity.

Thank you."
CPTSD,Anyone else triggered by not being heard/being misunderstood?,I feel like a fucking moody child. Sometimes I talk quieter because I'm preempting someone saying 'what?' and having to repeat myself. Or someone not understanding what I've said and I feel like all of the social energy is draining from my body and I just want to shut down or hide or something. I just like mentally FLOP
CPTSD,Struggling and told my mom goodbye today,"Today I (32F) texted my mom: â€œIt's odd to me that you took my sister away from gmaâ€™s house for feeding her baby food yet you leave me with two people you know are abusing me. It's also odd you wanted me to chat on Thanksgiving with your molester ex step dad. I will not forgive and forget the abuse, neglect, humiliation, and bullying I endured as a result of your choices. You are not welcome in my life. My sobriety and health are more important to me than seeking whatever salvation you think I need. You created the Pit. ðŸ”¥ 

For context, I stopped speaking to her for about 3 years 2018-2022 because she was in a mutually abusive marriage and wouldnâ€™t stop venting to me about it while Iâ€™m in college in another state alone with my own problems including CPTSD from childhood abuse (from the man she told everyone was my dad and his extremely abusing wife, and from the neglect and abandonment by my mom).

When I reached back out to her, I was going through a time of wanting to make peace and forgive and exercise unconditional love. I knew she was who she was because she experienced abuse growing up. The molester ex step dad molested her at 5 years old and tried again when she was a teenager. I genuinely feel compassion for what she has been through. She responded with sending me Joyce Meyers videos about â€œgetting out of the pit of unforgiveness, self-pity, etcâ€ and said I needed to thaw my cold heart. I played into this and invited her to visit me twice and invited her to my upcoming wedding. 

Iâ€™ve recently fallen back into experiencing severe CPTSD symptoms and pushing everyone in my life away aggressively due to paranoia and general poor mental health and lack of using coping skills. Iâ€™m tired of fighting my inner demons. 

Yes, Iâ€™m blaming her, yes Iâ€™m an asshole, yes, I am stuck in a cycle of abuse. A snake eating its own tail. I am the combination of her crazy ass and the man she had me with who wonâ€™t acknowledge my existence. 

But I will not subject my loving innocent fiance to the chaotic person I have become. Today I told him he deserves someone better, and I told her to fuck off."
CPTSD,Co-dependence/I'm still afraid of my ex,"I feel like all I do is post here lately. I am going to go thru our county for child support. My ex is an alcoholic. We have 4 kids, only one is still a minor. Ex is not responding to me at all, is behind payments etc. I am TERRIFIED of taking this next step. But I'm also tired of begging for support every month and being ignored. It makes stomach sick. All my *shit* is showing up, dissociating, blah blah blah. I have therapy tomorrow and Wednesday. WHY AM I STILL AFRAID OF HIM. I'm so frustrated with myself.

Edit: I'm afraid of him killing himself, drinking, it all being my fault. I hate him."
CPTSD,Managing flashbacks durinf early dating,"I have a date coming up with a woman who seems great on paper, but I keep having panic attacks and feeling like Iâ€™m going to be SAâ€™d (I know itâ€™s a flashback because every time I dated before, as soon as the person shows sexual interest, i go into freeze/disassociate and do whatever they say. I consent but within a flashback, so afterwards I feel awful).  I have been single since I started processing my CSA (itâ€™s been three years now) and she is the first person Iâ€™ve had an interest in.

Iâ€™m not sure how to deal with this, we have been talking online for 6 months and I am close to cancelling it as I am having nightmares and constantly panicking (itâ€™s next week).  

At the core, I think anything non platonic is massively triggering for me, and Iâ€™m scared of disassociating and causing myself more trauma.  We are just going to a cafe but the idea of someone looking at me romantically/me feeling that way towards her is so triggering.

Any advice would be appreciated"
CPTSD,What is the point of people?,"I've been in therapy for about 6-7 years. I've recently decided to stop with all forms of therapy. I felt like the therapists don't actually listen. I felt like they were always just waiting for me to say some keywords that they've read about before so they could throw some standard exercises at me and ignored everything else I talked about. I don't think they have ever truly listened, only pretended to as to not break trust until they could change the subject.

No matter what specific flavour of fluff they wrap around it, I've found that every form of therapy essentially boils down to ""you have to accept your emotions unconditionally and give the validation you need to yourself"". 

Ok fine, we live in an unloving society created by an unloving species and therefore I should never expect anything from someone else. I should never hope for or demand understanding from the people who've hurt me so deeply (my parents), I should just find the solution in myself somehow. I'm ultimately responsible for myself and my feelings are my own fault. It's my personal failure that I can't figure out a way to tolerate constant pain. It's my personal failure that I can't figure out how to have a relationship with my parents that doesn't destroy me on the inside. It's my own personal failure that I can't live with them denying and deflecting everything I've talked about with them. Fine.

All throughout therapy they've also told me that I'm too closed off and I have to ""reach out"" and ""ask for help"" though. What help? What is the person I'm reaching out to going to do? It's an internal problem after all.

I have tried to follow the advice many times, but I don't experience any value in reaching out. I don't understand what I'm supposed to be getting out of it, especially given The Lesson from therapy. In the end I have to do all of it alone, internally, anyway. Other people only add stress and risk.

Sometimes I share online like this because it's the most low stress form of reaching out for me. I think I'm done with *people* though. This is probably my last post. 

Thank you all who've ever tried to help me though, I do appreciate the time and effort. I'm sorry that I don't know what to do with it.

EDIT: I'm not going to hurt myself btw, sorry I just realized that that's what the last paragraph might sound like. I have a dog and a partner I'm staying alive for. If I ever lose both I'll end it but for now I'm fine."
CPTSD,Iâ€™ve reached out to extended family,"So, I donâ€™t have a good relationship with family (Irish v Scottish), Iâ€™ve been no contact with my parents since I was 7 years old (25 now) Iâ€™ve been observing friends with their families and I realised that I wanted to have a relationship with extended family. The issue I often get flashbacks and cold sweats from fear and anxiety if I talked to them. Last night I reached out to my aunt and I apologised for not keeping in touch with her and uncle. She understands the trust issues and was saddened when I told her that Iâ€™m seeking therapy for whatâ€™s happened. She said she is willing to talk more and support me on my journey to healing. We have agreed to meet when Iâ€™m ready to over a coffee and talk about family stuff. I feel better about reaching out and wanting to mend things and have a healthy relationship with her and uncle but Iâ€™m understandably scared of whatâ€™s to come. It took a lot of courage and anxiety but I did it and Iâ€™m glad that she understands."
CPTSD,Childhood Traumas I cannot specifically remember but keep getting triggered and making my life hell,"Hello Everyone, I 23F am having some terrible trouble with Childhood Trauma.

I had a rough childhood, both my parents are extremely narcistic as well as my two older siblings and I generally would say my childhood due to emotional manipulaton from my whole family was not too great. I can remember many individual instances from my childhood including being ignored by my whole family for days on end, or having to share a bedroom with my alcoholic father for multiple years.

After I moved out with my boyfriend at 19, things got way better.  But have always lingered in the back of my mind. 

I still have contact with my family, and have healthy boundaries and distance with them, but here the problem I am facing:

I seem to have blacked some things from my childhood out, to protect myself. I am fine with this, but random things in my life can trigger the trauma to mess with me. It can be as obvious as getting a text from one of my family members, but sometimes can be so weird things that have nothing to do with my family or childhood. It just pops up randomly..

It makes my life hell however. It causes me to becoming depressive and aggressive towards my partner for days on end.. I can sleep for 12 hours a night in these times and still be so tired the next day, it causes me stomach issues, skin issues and many more  


Do I need to figure out what individual things are bothering me or should I have a specific attitude towards this trauma? Please help!  


TLDR: Have some childhood trauma that although I am in general accepting of my childhood, randomly triggering and making my life hell!"
CPTSD,Is it normal to keep pissing people of?,My emotional needs and need for reassurance keep frustrating people who often just can't handle it. Is this normal? If so it just makes this all seem more unfair.
CPTSD,feeling depressed,Depression hit me like a ton of bricks yesterday. Canâ€™t feel a thing besides heaviness. Damn near catatonic. Just want to sleep but I know I canâ€™t
CPTSD,Every time I feel healed some other trauma comes up,"Is there a fucking end? I've emotionally healed as much as possible from CSA, COCSA. Every time my darkest things feel healed, some other more normal abuse comes up, like having a chaperone watch another kid punch me and not intervening because 'he needs to defend himself' or some shit. (This was well after layers of SA). I was never a 'he' to begin with. 

Humans, do better."
CPTSD,Im starting to accept I will not have a relationship or a family,"Hey everyone. Im female, turning 32 soon. Ive been in relationships since I was 18. Some have been better than others, some have been outright traumatizing. Before I met my partner now I had come far in my healing journey. When I read my old writings I dont recognize that person, who was so optimistic, soft, empathatic and emotionel matured. 
I met my now partner who had loads of unhealed trauma and severe depression, and I made it my mission to rescue him like I did myself. 4 years later and I can say, I think in someways I did rescue him. I got him out of his addiction, he got on medication and therapy and got back to school, and are now doing very well and loving it. He doesnt want to die anymore and sees a future. 

I on the other hand didnt survive it. The last 4 years has also been filled with emotional, physical and verbal abuse and I can pin it back to a year and a half ago where I died inside. That is when he was finally better, and then abandoned me. He didnt breakup, but instead stonewalled me for almost a year. For me it was a year of nervous breakdowns, confusing, feeling used, unloved and invisible. We are still together but I am still deeply depressed, now more than ever. All those old selfnarratives I had worked so hard to overcome is back. I hate myself. Im not taking care of myself anylonger and I have no hope for the future. 

I used to have a feelings of warmth in my belly. I could imagine it as this orange ray. I knew I lost it in childhood but I found it again. Now its gone, and I fear its gone forever.

Besides the trauma from the relationship, old trauma has ressurfaced. Many things in the way he is reminds me of my father. It has ressurfaced flashbacks from being a child in an abusive home. My nervous system is constantly fight/flight/fawn and my body is very inflammed. I know, I just know, I cant get pregnant anymore because my body has been through too much constant stress. I feel to old to leave and start over. My love for him is still endless, and it would be too hard. I miss him all the time when Im with him, but knowing I would miss him forever is too much. I find I cant let it go until he fully chooses me and sees me. Maybe not for who I am now but for who I was. And that he will love me. I dont think you can call what we have now a relationship. I find myself non-existing most of the time. "
CPTSD,My fear of judgment from other people may just make me fail school,"I had a 4 hour exam today which wasn't aware of until 3 minutes before it started. I keep forgetting everything. Tried my best to show up in time. Ended up being in front of the exam room 5 minutes late. 

And once there, I couldn't bring myself to open the door. I was only 5 minutes late and yet I was scared of the look other student and the teacher may have give me once I enter the room. So I went to the bathroom and locked myself there to cry. I couldn't (probably because I would be hit by my parents when I cried back when I was a child). 

After that, I went home, and now I am typing this while the other student are still in the exam room. I feel like shit.

It's not the first time something like this happened. Back in October I missed three school days in a row because I feared being 10 minutes late.

tbh I don't know where to post this but I just need to vent. Maybe in r/AvPD or r/socialanxiety or even in r/ADHD. I am just tired of being me and having all these mental health issues. I just wish I had a  normal childhood and that I could take my responsibilities and not run away every times.

&#x200B;

I don't even like the studies I am doing. I am currently studying to become an engineer and to be frank, I am mostly doing it because my parents want me to get a job that makes a lot of money and/or has a good reputation. I was the gifted mature silent kid who could ace everything without putting much effort. Now that my talent won't take me anywhere, I have to work, but I don't know how to. As a result, I am the last of my class. I hate school now and my friends are more acquaintances than actual friends. I feel so lonely too.

I hate seeing people getting disappointed by me. I am such disappointment. I want to die."
CPTSD,I hate feeling stuck in suffering,"I hate it. I am laying there and nothing seems important enough to do. Nothing I could do for fun is actually fun. Everything I do is just dreadful and I donâ€™t have the energy for anything. Music or movies are the only somewhat acceptable thing but yet they donâ€™t take up enough space on my mind and I still just lay there feeling awful, occasionally thinking about trauma or dissociating. Even thinking about going outside or talking to someone gives me the ick. I just wanna bury myself and be alone. Itâ€™s like there is nothing to do but lay there and suffer and just take it when feeling like this. Sleep is the only escape but you canâ€™t sleep for ever. Iâ€™ve been sleeping like 15h every day for the last couple of weeks. I donâ€™t even feel like getting high but still do bc itâ€™s the only thing making me like slightly feel better"
CPTSD,Who am I without CPTSD?,"Seriously? 

Who am I without it? 

What am I capable of? 

What would I be able to do, would I be more successful? Would I be able to have loving, rewarding relationships? Would I be happy? 

I barely know who I am full stop. I have no identity. I am a broken, empty shell. 

But who am I without CPTSD? 

I do not think I'll ever know. I will die before I know..that is a scary thought."
CPTSD,I give up,"I know being on high alert 24/7, mistrusting everyone at all times under all circumstances, and reading malice into every single interaction is unhealthy as hell.  I've been battling with myself for years over this, asking myself to give one more person a chance, to not shut the world out, to acknowledge my symptoms for what they are and not let them rule my life.

But time and time again every time i let my guard down slightly, force myself to open up a tad, it happens again.  I get hurt all the damn time.

Sometimes my shit social skills ruin a relationship.  Other times i just.  Don't even know.  I attract people who only use me when they need something?  I'm a fucking magnet for opportunistic emotional vampires?

Whatever it is, after my last moment of vulnerability, i give up.  I've been saying this for years but i always come down from it in time.  I think i'm serious now.  I think i genuinely cannot handle one more betrayal.  

I've tried.  I've tried so fucking hard for years.  I've tried to heal, to be understanding, to realize my symptoms, to be objective, to be as healthy as i can personally and socially.  I've tried to understand that not ever person out there is my parents, or family, or teachers, or doctors.  That there's good people in the world, or people who need a bit of help, who are struggling as much as i am.  

I understand humans are social creatures that require connection, but from this week forwards, after this last betrayal?  Every time i need connection, to share a happy moment, to talk to someone, i'm just busying myself with work.  I'll distract myself until i stop needing people because one more betrayal, one more instance of someone i genuinely trusted using me and abandoning me like yesterday's trash, is going to fucking kill me.  I can't survive another, i don't think.  This has been the worst thing a self-proclaimed ""friend"" could have ever done to me.

It doesn't matter if i need connection.  I need to stop needing it if i want to survive.  And i've fought way too hard to keep myself alive since i was a child to give up now.

I'm not going to hurt and abandon anyone that hasn't been the person who hurt me; that's cruel.  But i'm engaging in speak only when spoken to protocol.  If someone needs something so far as they're decent people i'm not going to be a dick.  But every time that i, personally, ache to reach out?  Fuck that shit; it's time to watch a video, study more, read a book, or whatever.

I'm aware this is unhealthy but it's all i can do to keep myself stable until i get in therapy again.  I can't handle one more betrayal i feel like i'm dying.  I can't do trust anymore and i struggle to see myself ever being capable of it again.  Friendship is overrated when everyone is only using each other all the time."
CPTSD,I almost (unintentionally) dated a married man. I'm always told to be more trusting of people and they do sht like this. Should I be trusting or not trusting?,"Basically the title. I hit it off with a guy I met, we had similar interests, life goals, hobbies, etc. Was really funny, charming etc. Yet I was always ""paranoid"" that this was all an act and he would probably turn out to be a serial killer or something lol. 

So I was taking my precautions, as always, and when we were going to meet at a public place, I planned on taking my own transport. However, a friend was calling me paranoid for doing this and suggested he pick me up. So I gave him my address... and now I regret it. 

Turns out the bastard is married (found his insta), and I'm worried that if i tell the wife, he knows where to come and confront me...

Anyway, its my fault for being trusting i guess... yet family, friends, therapists, etc always call me aloof and distrusting of people. I think this is one of the many reasons why I'm like this... you clearly can't just trust new people you meet, sometimes you can't even trust close friends, and not even family. I've had so many friends abandon me over the years, even family who became abusive... etc... 

Yet apparently i have to change and become more trusting when time and time again people break whatever little trust i have?? "
CPTSD,Today has been okay,"After years of fear, shame and self doubt I have finally agreed and been open to the idea of taking medication.

CPTSD,Does anyone else stop functioning when no one is around?,"I don't know if I'm just lazy or if this is trauma related, but as soon as I'm alone at home I literally stop functioning and just want to lie down in bed or on the sofa.

CPTSD,What helped you to actually feel and tolerate your feelings?,"I think Im finally at a point in my life where I feel safe enough to actually feel those damn feelings. I have needed decades to get stabilized, live a normal (ISH) life and whatnot. Now I know this is the missing piece. What do you do to tolerate your feelings?"
CPTSD,How do you cope with a mother that doesn't love you?,"Well my mom is a cruel POS. Growing up she's neglected me, invalidated me and hated doing anything for me..when I got depressed as a child she treated me even worse as if I'm a burden she couldn't stand. Then I was suicidal and cut my arms and my mom told me ""just go ahead and do it already."" She encouraged my su!cide. No mother who loves their child would ever say this no matter how mad they are. It just hurts so much to have a mother like this. I have no friends, partner or family either. Just all alone.

CPTSD,I can't handle making mistakes. It makes me want to hurt myself,"I make mistakes at work, in games, hobbies, talking to people, all the time. I cant learn from any of them no matter how hard i try. It always happens again and again.
Now, anytime i make one mistake, i start spiraling and get panicy and start hating life and hating myself and fantasize about throwing a tantrum at work and getting fired, or whenever i screw up i think about stabbing myself over and over.
Therapists haven't helped me because they are all garbage, thinking about them makes me lose my fucking mind.
God im so pissed, i have to take an ativan or two every shift because of one screw up my manager constantly reminds me of. I hate it..."
CPTSD,How helpful are meds?,"I'm 47.  I have never been on meds.  Well- I was on prozac for a short time as a teen, and it helped while I recovered from being eating disordered, but outside of it helping for that, I didn't like how it felt. 

I am so tired of waking up every day and finding out if I feel okayish or if I'm f'd, ya know? It's not consistent.  I have bad dreams, and sometimes I don't sleep good. Neither of those help. I know according to Pete Walker, a lot can go on while we sleep and we can wake up in emotional flashbacks. I am SO TIRED of it though. It feels totally unfair to wake UP this way and need to try to climb out of the damned hole before the day even begins. 

Are you on meds?  How much do they help? Have you had to change your dose a lot? What I cannot do is drink (I am a kidney donor and alcohol is not my friend) and thc makes me puke. I tried and tried with delta 8's but it just does me in. 

The other thing that makes me wonder if they would help is that I don't have my ovaries. I'm on estrogen and that saves me, but our ovaries do more than just estrogen, so I wonder if a little boost would somehow help fill in some gaps.  

I'm in therapy twice a week, so I'm SUPER covered there. I'm well versed in IFS and mindful meditation, and dissociating and PMDD and attachment disorder stuff, I just need to have a longer break than one day (yesterday I felt semi okayish, for whatever that means for myself personally).  I desperately miss having actual GOOD days, like before.  I mean, great, I was dissociated and I nearly died during PMDD episodes (premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which I am convinced is connected to C PTSD) but I would have 2 weeks of being a ray of sunshine and feeling so good, lol. 

Tell me about meds. "
CPTSD,Odd trauma triggers,"Hello all. First post, Iâ€™m new here. Just learning about all of this and just starting my healing journey after struggling for many years not really understanding why Iâ€™ve had so much underlying anxiety and anger and sadness and confusion and everything else inside me - cPTSD. Iâ€™m finally getting professional help: itâ€™s all very confusingâ€¦ and painful. 

Anywayâ€¦ I had this frustrating thing happen yesterday that I brought up to my therapist during my session and she explained something to me. So I wanted to ask you guys a question.

I was in the car (as a passenger) and the sun was really bright, so I had the sun visor down. The road was winding, so I had to keep adjusting the visor angle. It started to make me feel increasingly anxious, and then I started to get angry because I had to keep moving it. Like, I was getting super irritated, and feeling very anxious and panicked, I got really tense and irritable. It took me quite awhile to calm down after this fit. It made zero sense. WHY. Itâ€™s a stupid sun visor, and the sun. 

She explained trauma gets trapped in the body, and for whatever reason I had a trauma response to the sun and the visor yesterday. Sometimes you donâ€™t need a reason. And sheâ€™d be surprised after everything I had been through if I didnâ€™t have responses like that.

Anyway - my question for everyone here: what is a seemingly odd trauma response yâ€™all have had that didnâ€™t make sense at the time like my sun visor fit?"
CPTSD,"Too exhausted to do anything, surely I am not the only one fading away like this","I don't know how to describe it. I feel it in my bones.  Such a strong exhaustion, I am so drained.

I think about solutions, about forcing myself to do activities.  I think about healing work,    that self care, self work,   lifestyle work...  

 I feel my soul cry out. It says ""I have no energy, will or resource to do those things any longer, I'm tired. I can't do anymore""

I'm staying alive for other people's sake.

I need someone to come  help me at home but there is no way to get that at all.  I don't know the way out of this pit I'm in. "
CPTSD,How to cope with other people's anger/annoyance/frustration?,"Hi folks,

Looking for some advice for how to speak to people who are angry or annoyed (both with something you've done or something else) and how to support them. 

Essentially, when a friend or partner is annoyed or angry with something I've done I find it incredibly hard to separate from that and give them responsibility to feel that outside of me having to fix it. Similarly, if they're just angry about something else entirely I can really shut down. I know this comes from anger in my childhood home being dangerous and volatile and it immediately results in a childlike fawn response which I'm finding annoys or angers friends more when they need support. 

I also don't know how to talk to them or support them in any way. I don't easily experience anger myself so I can't tap into any resource that way, i.e. What would I like to happen when I'm angry. 

So my question to you is, how do you support people who are angry or upset? How do you support your partners? I never know what to say and end up asking them questions about what they need even if they ask me not to and tell me it isn't helpful. 

I hope this makes sense!"
CPTSD,I'm tired of being scared all the time.,"Sometimes it just hits me. I'm so tired of being scared of everything all the time. My own body, my thoughts, leaving the house, everyday confrontation, relationships ect. My hypervigilance knows no bounds. I started experiencing dp/dr a couple of years ago and I know it's my bodies way of telling me ""hey, you need to deal with this"" but, it still scares me. I am in therapy and a lot of things are going amazing for me. I have a safe home, a wonderful husband and friends, a stable job. I wonder if I'll always feel this way. I'm at my job currently experiencing a derealization episode and I can't stand it. Making it through the day feels really hard sometimes. Even though the good now outweighs the bad."
CPTSD,"Women: Where can you find men who are NOT misogynistic, patriarchal, and harassing?",
CPTSD,Lightbulb moment about being identified as easy prey/whore,"You know how once a child has been victimized, itâ€™s much more likely theyâ€™ll be victimized again and again? 

I was molested as a very, very young child. It happened a lot. I had several abusers over the course of my childhood, and repressed everything before age 12. 

I was a sitting duck for all the dangerously broken people in my life who needed to scratch a trauma itch. And then all of a sudden, right around age 12, the adults in my life, mainly my friendâ€™s moms, started calling me a whore. I was shy as a mouse, frozen in dissociated terror 100% of the time. 
Edit: I was Mormon at the time, and I dressed like one. Not that it should matter, but matters to me that itâ€™s known. It wasnâ€™t my fault.  

My lightbulb: what if whatever CSA changes in a little girlâ€™s psyche/nervous system/chemical make up, that identifies her as an easy victim to predators, is perceived by non-predators (but still sick mother fuckers.. who calls a 12 yo a whore?) as slut energy? 

It would explain a lot in my life. I was so painfully, painfully shy. You wouldnâ€™t believe the consistency of whore rumors (or the variety thereof) that followed me throughout my adolescent/teen years. 

I sincerely hope thereâ€™s a special place in hell for people who further ostracize, ridicule, and humiliate CSA survivors, and then as a result set them up as a targets for more unwanted sexual contact theyâ€™re too dissociated to say no to. 

In my mind, people like that are like demented flying monkeys. They continue the work and legacy of the child rapists, long into the future, and make sure victims never have the safety, self-esteem, awareness, or support to get the help they need. IOW, they continue to silence on the predatorâ€™s behalf."
CPTSD,How do I.. have a fuller life outside my house?,"First time poster here so apologies if I tagged a wrong flair. Just wondering if anyone has tips to overcome my (ir)rational fear of leaving my home because I'm afraid of being assaulted/harassed etc? 

Just for context, I'm still going out for work (it's only 10 mins away) and I'm still going out to have food etc. But, I have began to realise that I've been subconsciously rejecting the idea of leaving my home to a club/party/the mall etc basically places that harm can happen to me. It's really frustrating because I'm extroverted and I love going to these places. Sometimes when I feel well mentally, I do agree to go and have waves of irrational thoughts. I know these thoughts are valid because I have been assaulted in these places before (well, not a shopping mall but basically social spaces).

However, on one hand the hobbies I've developed at home has made me more of a hermit. I'm not complaining because these were hobbies that child-me couldn't participate in because of my abusive parents. But sometimes I feel like I've been hiding behind them because I'm too afraid to be assaulted again. 

I think my fear stems from the idea that I don't think I'm strong enough to withstand another kind of trauma happening to me. I'm too weak to endure another form of pain that I have no control over. I wish for a world that I'm able to dance, laugh & go out without worrying being traumatised again. Is that too much to ask for?"
CPTSD,I finally feel calm,"For a few days, I have been able to be comfortable in ""doing nothing"", just sitting. No nagging sense of hypervigilance or urgency. Stress data from Garmin watch also seem to confirm it. 
I made it without using any dissociative tools. It seems that I...just feel good in my own skin."
CPTSD,"Experiencing 3 divorces by the time I was 18 makes me ""know"" relationships never work out","So as the title says my (31M) parents divorced and both remarried and then divorced again by time I left the house. As youd expect there was a lot of screaming, low level violence and other great examples of how to be in terrible relationships. An aside: you ever wonder how the fuck people end up together? 

Anyway surprise surprise I dont have healthy relationships either. Ive been in 3 in my life (one in high school and the others in the more recent years) and though they've all been markedly better than the last, I've never once believed that any of them would ""work out"" because I ""know"" that relationships just dont work out. It really bothers me that I'm like this because I really do want to have a loving relationship and the last relationship I was in I really love(d) her and wanted to see a future with her but I just couldnt get past this. What can I do to be better for the future...that i dont believe in, but lets just pretend that i do for the ease of this post."
CPTSD,Isit normal to gaslight yourself? A scapegoat constantly blamed off a mother and brother for years. I convince myself that I'm lying and none of the abuse happened. I also forget some abuse situations I was in and panic that I made it up and I can't remember it? Help please.,
CPTSD,The hardest part of my healing journey has been mourning the person I couldâ€™ve been if not for the hell I went through growing up.,"Iâ€™ve been stuck in this thought spiral. Iâ€™m constantly losing myself in daydreams, thinking about the life Iâ€™d be leading right now if I grew up in a functional, loving home. Iâ€™d be unstoppable.

CPTSD,Do you sometimes under stress worry your dad or abuser hired someone to spy on you?,This is for people with cptsd and/or bpd who were almost killed by their abuser or dad for doing something that made them slightly angry. Do you in times of stress start worrying that your dad pays spies fo follow you with the aim of control and killing yiu if you donâ€™t abide? Do you also worry that when you get a phone call from them that theyâ€™re going to threaten to kill you? Iâ€™ve been like this since the abuse intensified and even though the abuse mostly stopped now because Iâ€™m not at home and I emotionally detached but not cut them off. I still get that a lot.

CPTSD,I hate the â€œgo to a homeless shelterâ€ solution.,"Anytime someone speaks out about wanting to leave a unsafe living situation a lot of times peoples solution is a homeless or abuse shelter. 
But to me this is just so frustrating. 
Because shelters arenâ€™t necessarily safe/fostering either! And can be very triggering to ppl with trauma. For hundreds of reasons. 
And itâ€™s incredibly dehumanizing and a terrible reflection on our society when the response to â€œIâ€™m being abusedâ€ is homelessness. Maybe I misunderstand? Maybe Iâ€™m taking it wrong? Am I Crazy for feeling this way????????????????????????"
CPTSD,DAE have random muscle strains and aches,"hi all... f 22, active lurker on here (this sub makes me feel so validated!)

I already deal with chronic pain from an unresolved pelvic injury and a myriad of aches and pains from endometriosis/ibs related issues. I've never been flexible, and I've always been super injury-prone (I pretty much sprain my right ankle every six months to a year). 

Saturday was the six-year anniversary of my estranged Mom's sudden passing. Between last Thurs and yesterday, I managed to strain two muscles (my left hamstring and my mid/upper back, like right by my shoulder blade.) The first I chalked up to poor form, but yesterday's pulling my back happened after the most LIGHT of workouts. Then I realized, my body is literally always at war with itself in some way. 

So, between the insane levels of cortisol coursing through my veins, and the trauma manifesting itself in the tightness of my muscles... does anyone else experience random muscle strains? Sprains? Like your body is just giving up on itself because it's so wound up?"
CPTSD,â€œMy trauma is not that bigâ€â€¦ Or is it?," Iâ€™m sure most if not all of us have had thoughts like this. I spent many years of my life thinking that the trauma Iâ€™ve been through couldnâ€™t possibly count as trauma because it â€œwasnâ€™t THAT badâ€. 

 That being said, Iâ€™m much more understanding of other people talking about their trauma and when they act like itâ€™s not a big deal, Iâ€™m taken aback at how relaxed they are about the horrible things theyâ€™ve been through. 

 In hindsight, my trauma is probably the reason Iâ€™m so scared of not doing something or not doing enough when I feel like someone is in trouble. Itâ€™s also probably why Iâ€™m so protective of kids and why Iâ€™m so mad when the adults around them are negligent/ abusive.

CPTSD,The way other people are nostalgic for the â€œlack of responsibilitiesâ€ or â€œfreedomâ€ they had during their childhood,"Itâ€™s so weird and isolating to hear people without CPTSD talk about how they miss the carefree nature of their childhood. Iâ€™m in my 20â€™s and I feel like many people my age talk about the burden of adult responsibilities and missing their childhood years for this reason. For me, reaching adulthood was the ultimate escape. Life is hard, but at least now I have the control to take care of myself and the peace of not living in fear every day. Itâ€™s hard not to wonder what I would have been like with a childhood like theirs."
CPTSD,I am struggling.,"I was diagnosed about 6-7 months ago with C-PTSD after finding a new therapist and psychiatrist. Weâ€™ve come to the basic conclusion that my very unsteady, abusive (emotional/mental), and difficult upbringing is the root cause but there are so many offshoots from it like abandonment with my mom going to jail, my dad being emotionally absent, and especially with my momâ€™s claws in my brain nitpicking everything I said, did, or ate. Thereâ€™s so much more to it and so complex I canâ€™t even get into it.

Iâ€™ve come to realize that who I am today isnâ€™t really me per se, but the me that was shaped by all this shit. And I try to get better and get out of these habits and thoughts and routines but, and I start to, and then I just go right back into it, like I never left.

For anyone out there who has worked on their C-PTSD, how long did to take you to really get a hold on it? Does it get better?

I just donâ€™t like the â€œmeâ€ I am right now, and I want to be better, but Iâ€™m scared this is it for me, like Iâ€™ll always be this broken and fucked up."
CPTSD,How to not being so rush/pushy,"Hi,im on my path to healing from my cptsd,one thing i really struggling with is being too rush, because me and my gf are doing the same healing thing,i tend to really rush sending tons of video/advice to her,she think im being too much but she's understanding so we're cool about it(she can being honest to reject me),so i would want some advice on how to control my urge of being so rush :("
CPTSD,Aversion to sex?,"Anyone here currently struggle with, or have struggled with sexual aversion due to trauma?   What does it feel like to you?  And if you were able to overcome it,  how did you? 28m here"
CPTSD,Struggling to be honest,"I've noticed that I really struggle to be honest and open, both with friends and acquaintances, and even my family. The other day I was wondering why it was so difficult for me to form any relations with the new people I've been meeting at college, and then it hit me that I monitor everything I say.

A girl had asked if I wasn't close with my siblings, and rather than saying ""I'm not really close with them, no, but we're trying"" which is the truth, I just said ""Oh, hm, I don't know, I wouldn't say we're not close,"" and I was just vague. Of course, I don't have to share everything with every person I meet, but this is just one example I noticed of how I make every aspect of my personal life and myself vague and 'palatable.' It's so hard to connect with people when the only point where I share things about myself is when I'm 100% certain it is a thing they do too or don't mind.

I get so uncomfortable at the thought of being honest. It's like I have this need to separate my private life from my family life from my college life from my friend life. Like they're independent parts of me I cannot let mix, but maybe that's what makes me distant and impersonal, and therefore hard to connect to. I cannot pretend to be a whole person when I don't allow my whole person to exist. And exactly that is probably also why I'm not close with my siblings, I don't tell them about myself, just the general small talk.

I don't even know what to do to change it, because part of the reason I watch what I say is because I don't want to overshare the stuff I've been through, since that makes me insanely uncomfortable as well. I pretend to be the person who never went through any of it, but it's aspects of my whole life I'm burying when I do that."
CPTSD,I've never felt any love or connection to my son (I'm his mom),"I already know what everyone will say. The good and the bad, the causes, the psychology and the solutions. I'm not bad or good. I'm a victim but not an innocent one. I am selfish and I am very very sad. 

My timeline looks like this:

0-15 sexual abuse

15-16 ran away from abuse but then just sold my body to have a way to live 

17 son was born 

17-25 lots of physical and emotional abuse 

26 is the year I was safe. 

27 is when he stopped living with me. He can come back at any time I want. But I don't want. I don't want him here. I want to be able to kill myself if I decide so without having to arrange someone to pick him up from school and then coordinate somewhere for him to stay. He's already with someone safe now. I don't want him back because I can't afford him. I can't afford myself even. Heat and electricity are both $1000 behind. They're not off because it's illegal to turn it off in winter. Every other bill is always late or gone to collections. 

I tried to go to college but I have no passion. I have no interests. I have no drive. I just want to be not broken. My soul is like puss. It's an infection. I am like the puke you find in the stairwell in a parking garage. Theres nothing that can make a pile of slimy vomit appealing to pick up and take home and it is the same with me. Nearly every second of the day I am in pain because I know that I am only good to beat up or rape. I know that if hell existed, I would have to burn there for trillions of years just for my soul to be clean enough to deserve to be smiled at or hugged or kept safe. 

I just do gig jobs. It gets me enough money to live off of frozen fruit. I'm not going to get a better job because I am not going to put myself around men. I'm too scared of them and I will panic and hurt myself and just quit the job. Any time i see a man being nice to a woman I spiral for days. And that is often. I contacted so many resources but I can't afford even the cheapest therapist which is about $110 for 50 minutes around here. Im never going to make enough money to afford that. 'sliding scale' therapy doesn't exist here. 

Anyway i never felt any connection to my son. I don't hate him or dislike him. I feel very scared to think of him suffering. He's not suffering now. He was suffering with me. I wanted to love him so badly when he was a baby. I wanted to draw strength from being a mother. I wanted to find all this strength from no where and be a strong hard working single mom like all those other single moms. But I am just empty and feel nothing. I don't even think I'm human. I am an infection. I only deserve to get beat up. I hope I can bring myself to end my life soon.

If you want to say anything just please don't say something nice like that I'm not ruined or broken. That's true for most people but not for me and I don't expect anyone to understand. I am just trying this because I've been crying for about 4 days now non stop and I don't know what else to try and i have no one to talk to. "
CPTSD,I donâ€™t bite my fingernails anymore.,"When I was a kid, my mum berated me for biting my fingernails. But, I kept doing it out of spite, I think.

For 36 years, I never needed nail clippers. 

In the 6 months since realising and beginning to process my childhood trauma, I havenâ€™t used my teeth to clip my fingernails. I donâ€™t remember making the conscious decision, I just stopped, and itâ€™s weird.

Maybe it shows how much of an immature prick I am. Maybe it shows that as a child I craved a bit of control even if it meant sacrificing my health. Maybe it means Iâ€™m healing. Maybe itâ€™s Maybelline. Deno, but it feels strange to have long fingernails and to have to use nail clippers."
CPTSD,Split upbringings?,"I haven't really been able to find someone with my experience yet, searches just lead me to posts with related keywords but completely different content, so here I am. 

My parents split when I was two, so from my earliest available memories, this was always how it was. My parents were friendly, but not friends, they were easily able to talk coparenting but didn't communicate if it didn't directly pertain to me. I have no trauma or negative thoughts on this, specifically.

I spent most of my time with my mom, who was amazing and the best parent I could have possibly asked for. To this day, (early 20's now) she is everything I could need and want from a parent.

I spent alternate weekends with my dad, who was a good enough parent but somewhat of a pushover. He was definitely more of a Disney Dad, and was more focused on enjoying his limited time with me than being an actual parent. He basically let me do whatever I want, most rules and boundaries set by my mom did not apply at his house, and there were plenty of times he would encourage or allow me to go behind my mom's back and do things I wasn't allowed to, like putting me on the back of his motorcycle starting around age 9, but I know he loves and cares for me, and did his best. BUT, enter my (former) stepmother. He married her when I was 5, and they remained together until I was 14. 

I can confidently say her presence in my life is the cause of 95% of my childhood trauma, the remaining % being things from school or other non-home environments. And my dad, being in an abusive and unhealthy relationship of his own with her, became her enabler. Between her, and my older stepbrothers, I was constantly belittled, insulted, dismissed, treated as a dress-up doll with no bodily autonomy, 0 privacy, and a number of other things. I was fortunately never hit (by her, my brothers did though) or sexually abused but I *was* physically violated in a number of other ways that showed a complete lack of regard for or willful discarding of my autonomy, privacy, and personhood. 

And my dad would play both sides, he would emphasize with me and act like he understood and would apologize on their behalf, and would correct my brothers performatively, and occasionally push back on my stepmom, but was unable or unwilling to do anything meaningful to protect me in any real way, so this cycle repeated every single visit for almost 10 years
.
I was also adultified in that regard, from a too young age I was an ear for his marital problems; always hearing about her putting him in debt and fucking other men and constantly giving him shit etc., things that a child shouldn't have put onto them, because I was ""mature for my age"" (gee, wonder why.) 

And I would go back to my mom's house, and while she did know I hated going, I was too young to be able to express exactly what was happening over there and how deeply it was affecting me. I am also autistic, but wasnt diagnosed until much later, so I had limited ability to even fully process those feelings to begin with, let alone explain them. As I've gotten older I've been able to reiterate the stories I told her over the years in a much more accurate and complete way and my mom was horrified to hear everything she wasn't able to see at the time, especially because anything she DID feel the need to address with my dad back then was easily explained away or dismissed by him in a way that made it sound just generally annoying, but not traumatizing or harmful to me. 

So essentially, I experienced two exactly opposite upbringings. I had, for the most part, a beautiful home life, with a mother who made me feel safe, seen, supported, accepted, encouraged, and loved. She gave me everything she had and then some. I was taught healthy habits, communication, and behaviors. I had structure. And I hold no negativity in my heart towards her for sending me over there, because had she *known*, she would have done everything in her power to protect me, and even not knowing nearly the extent, still took small steps to try and improve things over there when she could.

But then I would go to my dad's and all of that would be promptly undone. I experienced the exact opposite of everything i just wrote about my mom, and again, this cycle would repeat every two weeks for 10 years. 


As a result, I feel like I have a split personality without the split personality. There are two separate, opposite people inside of me. The one who knew only love, and the one who knew only hurt. And as much as it kills me, it feels like the traumatized me won out for the most part, despite being statistically a much smaller percentage of my childhood, time-wise.

And for the life of me, I havent found this experience mirrored anywhere else and and I don't know what the hell to do with it. Even people I see who kind of relate, their 'good parent' *knew* what was happening and either ignored it or refused to see it, and it soured the relationship to some extent, which isn't the case at all for me. 

I don't really know how to end this post, I guess I'm just looking for any others who grew up like this, and have any insight or just want to relate."
CPTSD,Why is reading a better activity for burnout?,And even reading something online doesn't feel as peaceful as reading a book?
CPTSD,Can we talk about people that use their own trauma to be manipulative? And selective empathy?,"Sometimes people will use their own trauma to invalidate you, or cross your boundaries. 

For example someone is being condescending towards you, call them out on it and they say something like ""i do not apreciate the way you are engaging with me, it is how my narcissistic parent engages with me"". Basically implying you are a narcissist, but after they have been abusive. 

Or if you state an opinion and someone uses their experience to invalidate yours. This one is difficult cause the statement is usually so emotionally heavily loaded you cant say anything without coming across as an absolute asshole. 

And how do you cope with selective empathy. Usually when people form a mob, even if its a small one, their empathy becomes highly selective. And it doesnt matter if you are a victim or not, it also doesnt matter what you are saying. If they have their sights set on you, anything goes and they usually dont even realise they are being abusive either. They validate each other and cheer each other on to bully someone, they dogpile on a person. You would think this just happends in schools, which is already traumatising. But adults are no strangers to these, i've seen it happen time and time again. It's almost as if some people like having a common enemy, a black sheep. Maybe its a coping mechanism to not become a target, but if you have become the target how do you cope with this? If you have a mental breakdown they just point at you like ""look see told you, crazy person!"" If you dont respond you are either cast out of the group as a whole or silently suffering."
CPTSD,Tips on how to not get bullied ?,"Mainly in the workplace. 

Feel free to vent about whatever u experienced."
CPTSD,body dysmorphia/self esteem trauma from bullying experience/vent,"23F Being rejected my entire life due to my body shape and face and size has given me an intense fear of my body being perceived at all and I always want to hide. I have a really hard time dating because I have been bullied and rejected over my looks so many times that I canâ€™t trust anyone to actually find me attractive or not ultimately leave me for someone attractive because I am that ugly. I fear no one will ever really want to sleep with me and Iâ€™ll continue to be a placeholder for guys who canâ€™t get the girls they want. A lot of the guys I date their friends make fun of them for dating me. The newest guys friend said my pic looked like a man. It hurts so bad because I really donâ€™t even see whatâ€™s so bad, I think sometimes itâ€™s specifically shallow people who think Iâ€™m ugly but other times it feels like itâ€™s everyone. Even my friends. Iâ€™m scared of going in public a lot of the time because Iâ€™m scared someone will insult me. And I cannot trust any men because they have been so mean to me about my body and itâ€™s been most of them. But I want to trust men because Iâ€™m straight and want to find love one day. It just sucks. I want to be beautiful because it feels like that would save my life, I know it wouldnâ€™t realistically but after all this pain related to my looks itâ€™s hard to imagine how it wouldnâ€™t."
CPTSD,A childcare professional told me a bunch of nonsense and reminded me of the banality of evil,"A while back I met a guy I'll call ""Bob"".

Bob is not a therapist per se, but he does work with children professionally. Families pay him for his advice on how to deal with very troubled children, including those that self-harm and those that become violent towards others.

Recently Bob told me about his approach to helping children, and I thought to myself ""This is the face of evil"".

Let's be clear: Bob is a nice guy in many ways. If you met him he'd seem perfectly normal, affable and even generous. He makes special efforts to connect people in his community by hosting large parties, and he gets along well with everyone. I've even seen him interact with children (non-professionally) and he seemed pretty reasonable.

But when I say that he reminded me of ""The Face of Evil"", what I mean is evil is typically not obvious. Evil ideas can be found in otherwise good people, and those ideas can go unchallenged for decades on end, even if they do incredible damage in the meantime.

For instance, think of the traditional treatment of gay people and consider that many millions of homophobic bigots were *otherwise good people*, good friends and neighbors to anyone who wasn't gay. Consider that many of these same people had genuinely good intentions for their gay friends (assuming they discovered any), but their bigoted beliefs twisted good intentions into horrible actions.

I say this as a queer person myself, btw. And of course there are plenty of openly sadistic homophobes in the world. But it's the quiet bigots that catch my attention just now.

I have personal experience being a person who *thinks* he's doing the right thing when *actually* he's doing the wrong thing. =(

---

Anyway, recently I spoke to Bob about how he deals with troubled children. He recited what was obviously a well-practiced spiel that he presumably gives to clients when they first hire him. His delivery was calm and confident, and *full of bullshit*.

He had one point that sounded good before it turned bad. He said that everyone expects him to teach the kid Anger Management, but that's not the solution. He said that kids get angry because they're in *pain*, and you have to address that first.

At this point I thought ""Good! Some compassion for children."" But then he took a wild turn. He said the way to deal with a kid's pain was to make sure that *the pain of disobedience is always greater than the pain of obedience*. In other words, punishment is the only solution.

He gave an example of a kid who doesn't want to do a chore and curses out the parent. The answer is to take away the kid's phone, only giving it back to her once the chore is done. Bob explained that the pain of losing the phone is greater than the pain of doing the chore, and thus the kid will do the chore.

Bob gave no thought whatsoever as to whether the chore was reasonable in the first place. Bob did not care to ask whether the child might be in pain for other reasons unrelated to the chore. In fact, Bob was *explicitly* disinterested in the reasons behind the child's anger and distress.

Bob told me to interlace my fingers, then asked why I do it that way and not the other way (with the other thumb on top). He said that people don't know why they interlace their fingers a certain way, and then generalized this to *nobody knows why they do anything*. He said that if you ask kids why they act out they'll never have an answer for you. He also said that adult alcoholics have no idea why they're driven to drink so much. He said the answer in all cases was to *deliberately avoid getting insight into someone's pain or motivation* and focus entirely on the behavior itself. And the only way to alter behavior is to induce punishment for disobedience.

I work with kids too, in a different context. In my experience, kids are *quite* willing to tell you what's bothering them *if you only listen*!!! If you establish yourself as a trustworthy person who actually cares about them and has no interest in needlessly bossing them around, *then* they will open up about their problems.

But Bob isn't interested in hearing about a kid's problems. Bob is interested in *obedience*.

Bob gave his whole speech in a calm, confident and well-practiced manner. There wasn't a trace of cruelty anywhere on his face. But all the same, he was remarkably cruel.

PEOPLE PAY FOR THIS!

People pay *good money* for a guy to tell them how to be a jerk to their own children. People pay *good money* for bullshit advice delivered with confidence. It's no wonder why my childhood was so fucked up, when the community tolerates and even encourages absolute bullshit like this. My parents never met Bob, but he's emblematic of a bigger cultural problem. Bob-style *ideas* are floating around everywhere, and children like me are effectively erased.

Most people don't even register ""anti-child bias"" as a possibility. We know that racism exists and sexism exists and homophobia exists, but the idea that there's a bias against *children* hardly ever seems to enter the public mind, despite all the obvious evidence. (See here for instance: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201805/children-s-teens-suicides-related-the-school-calendar )

As for me? I kept a straight face during the entire spiel. I probed a little, asked a couple leading questions, but ultimately I didn't challenge Bob at all. Why? Because I can't afford to lose him. I need to keep going to the events he hosts, not only for my sake, but also for the sake of the neighborhood children who come along too.

I talked to several of those kids when Bob was out of earshot, and told them of how the world (particularly the schools) doesn't respect children's rights. I focused on [Sudbury Schools](https://www.facebook.com/HudsonValleySudburySchool/videos/10155951019968804/) as an example of how to do things better.

The kids were overjoyed to hear my ideas, to hear that there are others like me in the world, and to hear that there's a better way to live.

I wish I'd had that experience when I was young. I wish that child-me had met somebody like adult-me. It might have saved me from an incredible amount of pain. =(

CPTSD,"I was thinking about all the mistakes I've made in my life and I think the worst one of all was when I decided to give humanity yet one last chance, even at the cost of my final plan b escape plan.","I had an escape plan. Go live in my car, camping for free on BLM and USFS land.

But after I had already begun to get everything ready, I had this last minute thought that I should give humanity one last chance. It has gone worse than ever before. 

I feel like I betrayed my child self, and the promise I made that I would never force him (me) to endure the hell this long. That I would find an escape. That I would get us (me) out of all this and we (I) could just go live out in the wilderness with the only place that ever seems to fit. Nature. 

But then I did this stupid stupid stupid thing, and tried to give humanity another chance. It's like I moved into a hive of wendigos, a pestilence of bullies. 

So now my last escape route is gone. 

My suicide treaty ends in 8 days and the only thing between myself and the end is a confirmation above every other confirmation that this is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but the only solution to a permanent problem. 

I would plead with all of you to not make the same mistakes. 

If you ever have the chance to escape and live out your final years in the wilderness, please don't trade that option to give humanity another chance. They are never going to change. Our child selves were right all along - humans are not reliable, humans are not trustworthy, the bullies will always betray you, hide, hide from them all, never trust anyone, go, go be with the natural world. There is more respect in even a blackbear than ever could be found in this garbage culture, garbage nation, garbage people. The only interact with you because they want something from you.

CPTSD,i feel embarrassed to still be mad over things that happened so long ago,"first post here so this is kinda tame

whenever i even just think about my old middle school i get stressed out because i was struggling so much back then. Even though its been years since i left that school, it still just makes me mad, even tho i had a somewhat better experience than other people there. 

I had such severe social anxiety (even before covid) and online school completely ruined my mental health for most of grade 8. i was pretty much scared to be in my grade 8 class in-person because it was mostly only boys in the class which for some reason im rly uncomfortable with, and because grade 8 was when i found out i was bi, and everyone in the class had the same religion as me and was homophobic. i really hated myself so much that year. there is also one more thing which im not comfortable sharing, but it involved me having an addiction to something i was very ashamed of.

even though its been many years (im gr11 now) i still get genuinely mad whenever i think abt that year or just the school in general. not only was i struggling that whole year, but it also took me a long time and so much effort to get better socially and to somewhat like myself more, which im still not satisfied with.

but i just feel embarrassed that im still hung up over things that happened so long ago, and that i dont really have a specific someone to blame. does anyone else feel this way?"
CPTSD,Is anyone elseâ€™s worst symptom(?) realizing how much most people suck?,"I know that sounds weird and pretentious. But I feel like as trauma survivors we start out without the social norms, the preconceived notions that everyone is good on some shallow level, etc. and itâ€™s just so fucking obvious to me how much most people suckâ€”not entirely and probably not inherently, but in so many situations. If thereâ€™s someone getting bullied, most people will join in or gaslight the victim rather than stand up for them. Etc. I just hate being around people the majority of the time. Even being on social media really sucks because most people are assholes if anyone says something they disagree with, etc. It bothers me to see it directed at anyone and it bothers me that people can walk around acting this way towards others and still be celebrated"
CPTSD,Coming to my senses after a very weird therapy relation,"Funny and unfortunately true story: I spent close to 3 years (!!!) in therapy with a therapist who wasnt a good fit, just because he is incredibly handsome and smiled a lot to me. Whats really fucked up is, all this time I was on a waiting list to a yoga-psychologist. But I got hooked on watching his pretty face and megawatt bulb smile and getting my shitty life story validated. As a therapist he was awful. No sense of how important safety and trust is for trauma patients. I both dreaded the sessions and looked forward to being in his presence. Im also old AF, so I should have known so much better.

&#x200B;

( He is considered one of the best in this country, and I was offered free therapy in exchange for our sessions being taped and used for educational purposes. I am an extremely shy person. Theres almost no photo of me - ever. Of course I couldnt relax in that setting, And yet I continued for close to 3 years???)"
CPTSD,Another one bites the dust.,"Trigger warning for relationship breakdown and general mention of traumatic events. 

I would really like to get this out.

Partner has had enough of me and today I told them we'll be going our separate ways when the lease for our current place is up. (March) I have been going between crying and dissociative. I feel a little lucid right now. 

They don't know how to ""handle"" me anymore and they feel like they're becoming a bad partner because of the way they're being affected by my own trauma. 

We have been together almost six years and the last two years have been incredibly hard. I thought it was just about covid and things might get better but their depression has gotten worse despite making efforts to change their lifestyle to better accommodate their identity. For a long time they have been a great partner, we are both neurodivergent and understand the problems that can come with that. 

I've been getting treatment for my CPTSD a d have made huge progress in my own sense of the world.

But today they broke down over a silly meme I shared. It was just a drawing of a frog that said ""I know I have responsibilities but honestly I'm a little brain damaged for the rest of my life, I hope you understand"" I just enjoyed the sort of gallows humour of being a recovering drug addict, having cptsd, and, in quite a literal sense, head trauma from being assaulted. I said it on my Facebook because I'm friends with a lot of other traumatized, recovered addicts, and frankly, brain damaged people or those who think of themselves as brain damaged. So we all had a little giggle over it. 

One of the issues that they've had to go through is dealing with the second-hand trauma after being told my story. They can't fathom the evil in the world. They can't fathom, somebody going through those things still being here today. I've tried getting them to counselling but they had a bad experience with the first counsellor and doesn't want to try again.

I think they finally realised that I'm never going to get better. Despite my resilience. That things will never truly be okay and that no matter how far away from what I've been through, my brain is rewired because of trauma and it doesn't matter WHAT I or they do, it's always going to be there. 

I also have some physical disabilities that are getting worse. Back problems, neck problems, internal problems. It's just been an ongoing thing and it's not going to change, it's not going to improve. The things I used to be able to do, that I thought I could reclaim someday, I won't ever be able to do them again. It's just gonna get worse and today they finally realized that. I told them to run many times over the years. I guess they finally realised they have to in order to save themselves. 

Today will have the lyrics of ""Margot Robbie"" by Xavier Dunn and Eluera on repeat in my head. 

""I'm so sick of being a little too much. For everyone I love. Over-filling the cups and then drowning. How did I allow this? I'm so sick of everything I touch. Turning to dust, Try to keep us together but I'm fatal. Oh, is this too painful?""

If you read this far, thank you for letting me get it out."
CPTSD,I don't have a cool interesting title. I just need to spill my guts for a bit,"First thing I don't know what to say but fuck it. I'm so tired, and I mean extremely unfucking believably emotionally drained. I feel so depressed, angry, exhausted and just dead.

Part of me wants to go completely berserk, like tear someone's head off and beat them to death with it while screaming till my face turns blue and killing anything that I can get my hands on. 
Another part of me wants to just cry and cry and cry and cry and just disappear, not like dying but full on stop existing entirely.
And another part of me just wants to know what the fuck I did to never experience love or even safety, be treated like a slave by my parents a freak by other people and a sex toy by pedophiles.

I feel so fucking lonely, like hire a prostitute just to be held or make a life like replica of my crush and makeout with since she was the only person in my life that has ever showed me kindness or compassion or like she wasn't going to torment me just for fun and drive me to suicide just to watch me suffer and I'm losing hope in the dating scene since my last ""relationship"" was me dating a girl I never met before because some creepy student that liked making me uncomfortable making sexual moans and thrusting as if he was fucking my ass and refused to stop even after I told him several times to stop and that I don't find it funny and that I find it unsettling and disturbing.

And even if I do somehow get a real girlfriend I'm pretty sure my csa trauma from a homeless man molesting me and trying to rape me will end up driving the girl away leaving me alone with no one.

And it infuriates me when my friends tell me that ""don't worry about getting a girlfriend"" well no, I will worry because my family never loved me, the closest thing to a father I've ever had is dead, my house cat got put down by my parents because the cat showed me unconditional love.

Secondly I'm unemployed and finding a job is like pulling teeth. I've put billions and billions and billions of applications out and haven't got anything out of it. Employment agencies have not been helping no matter what I do. I feel like I'm going batshit insane just staying in my house all the time.

And with everything costing an arm and a leg it feels like even if I get a job ill have to work for so long before I could afford even the cheapest stuff.

Thirdly is for over a year my right eye has been completely messed up. It's red swelling it hurts and mucus keeps coming out. I've seen my family doctor 3 times and now I'm seeing an eye doctor or whatever they're called because I've been proscribed topical antibiotics 3 times and nothing helped. A part of me wants to just claw it out and say problem solved because I'm tired of dealing with it.
Usually my body would have no problem with healing, hell I've jumped of a moving golfcart because a group of people said that if I did they'd be my friend and my stupid ass was so desperate to have friends so without any hesitation I jumped off, and I healed quickly, but now thanks to stress premature aging and other stuff I don't heal as quickly or even heal at all. I'm 21 and I feel like I'm FAR past my prime. 
I'm a young man I should be at physical peak but instead I'm in constant pain and my body's falling apart even as my youth is the only thing holding me together. When I wipe, blood, when I blow my nose, blood, when I brush my teeth, blood.
I feel like I'm slowly dying while something refuses to let me die. Just endless torment.

Fourthly is nothing brings me happiness anymore. No matter what I do I don't get any pleasure from it. I get a tiny barely noticeable amount of dopamine or serotonin and then it's gone as fast as it came like I felt something different for a nanosecond and then back to nothing but the darkness filling my mind like a black cloud of despair hovering over me. Like a phantom in my head that I'll never fully understand.

Fifthly I've been ""seeing"" a therapist but my last visit was in September and I haven't had any contact from them since and when I contacted them they said they'd contact me and nothing so I feel like I've just been abandoned and betrayed like I was so meaningless like I was not worth the dirt on their shoe. And what pisses me off more is that it's the second place I've contacted.
The first therapist I filled out a registration form 3 times and each time I waited the 5 day waiting period the form said and after that I switched to the therapist I'm going to now.

Sixthly is I don't know if I'll get any hate but I'm just going to put it out there. I'm not happy about what people like louder with crowder and other conservative outlets are saying about anything gay related like the pope not condemning homosexuality.
I'm a conservative or right wing but now I question if I should still consider myself politically right or just leave.
I agree with some right wing view points like I'm pro gun and pro life but I'm caedromantic [Ace because of trauma] so does that make me bad even though I believe in the right to bare arms for protecting yourself and believe in that every unborn child deserves life.
I agree with some of their opinions but does me not being completely straight after being molested make me bad or evil.
Now I don't know if I want to associate with right wingers in any way, most of them just seem to start becoming more and more crazy or deranged.
And the only reason I've ever called myself a conservative is because I find or at least found the political right as slightly more tolerable but now I feel like I don't want to be anywhere political since it feels like both sides are just two sides of the same coin just with different faces.

Sorry for the long post. I just needed to get a lot out. If you've made it this far and haven't crucified me because of the last bit, thanks.
Also if this post causes any drama or problems I'll delete it."
CPTSD,Feeling Guilty/Disgusted by Positive Emotions?,"does anyone else feel overall disgusted with themselves and feel like they are the scum of the earth? why do i feel so disgusted with myself whenever i am happy or feel any kind of positive emotion? i especially feel very embarrassed and humiliated when i am happy around other people or when i feel anything other than dread, anxiety, shame, anger, or resentment. i am disgusted with every inch of my body. i am so disgusting! 

also, my mom makes me uncomfortable. something is off. she goes from infantilizing me to calling me names and screaming at me. she makes me feel disgusting and embarrassed to exist. i am in a constant state of discomfort and do not know how i am expected to continue living like this! i'm 18, she talks to me like a baby. it's gross. she tells me tmi things. it's gross. 

i feel so comfortable being miserable that being happy disgusts me."

CPTSD,Do you believe that you are a soul?,"Do you think that you are a spiritual being here with a body on planet earth?  Iâ€™ve been sensing this more and more as I heal but yet have no real experience of this soul.  Is this just earth school for awakening?  Where is this all going?  

Any thoughts?"
CPTSD,Vent? More like a documentation.,"I don't remember my life. Barely any of it except for moments cut loose from any connecting thread. Individual memories and a vague foggy idea of how my life went. I've been remembering more moments and started to find connecting threads and it makes me feel like a detective like I'm trying to research someone else's life to figure out why and who they are. Most of what I find kinda sucks and today's discovery was no different.  

I asked my mom today ""why did you decide to have me"" I've always thought they didn't want me. That i was a waste of space and that she had me to get the approval of her own abusive parents and the cult we were apart of. I was right. There was more than i thought though about my early early life and it's kind of messing with me I don't know how to sort and process the information i got.

She told me ""i had you cause i wanted to take the next step in my relationship, i knew it was something i should do kind of an inevitability. I've always hated kids even when i was a kid myself I've always hated them. They were loud annoying and gross. when your father talked about the possibility of not being able to have kids i was overjoyed at the possibility. But we had you and i was excited, you were so sweet and quiet i had a great time when you were really young. I went back to my job and worked until you were eight months old letting your aunt take care of you. She was great until she told me how cute you cousin was beating you up, pulling your hair, hitting you, slapping you. After that i quit my job and we had a lot of fun playing and cleaning and sorting things but you slept a lot strangely usually like 17 hours a day. Things changed when your brother was born. You were such a quiet angel of a kid i was not ready at all for your Brother. It's totally your fault for not preparing me for the insanity that is your brother. At that point i didn't do great taking it my frustrations and exploding out of stress.""

I hate that i was right about why she had me and how little it actually came down to wanting a kid and more to improving her relationship and satisfying her family. But the fact my cousin "" beat the shit out of me"" for months as an infant kinda came out of left field. I've always hoped that maybe my infancy at least wasn't filled with hurt. It sucks to be proven incorrect about that.

Thanks for reading and joining me in this discovery some. Any input is really appreciated ðŸ™‚."
CPTSD,"When people tell me ""but she's your mother. She tried to love you. You should forgive her and be the bigger person"" just INFURIATES me","I'm so done with people, my own friends, my own neighbours tell me ""but she's your mother"". (Don't worry, I don't talk to them).

Idc. She hurt me. Just because she birthed me, doesn't excuse her behaviour. Just because she's my mother, doesn't make the abuse *okay* in anyway. 

My mother thrives on forgiveness because she told me herself; after she slept with her best friend husbands (multiple husbands of different friends), blackmailing her own friends, committed fraud at work... ""I'm so glad they forgave me because I can do it again. That's why jesus died for our sins. I can be forgiven and I can do it again and again and again. That's why jesus died for me"". 

It just pisses me off. I hate the whole ""fOrGiVe hEr"" bull. It means nothing to her. 

Has anyone else had the same thing? Or something similar?"
CPTSD,Is it a good idea to just sit here feeling sad about something?,"This is kinda new to me - I've had to repress many of my emotions super deep since I was a child. Over the past 9 months I've gotten a bit better at noticing certain emotions, but I usually don't know what to do with them.

Currently, I'm feeling some old emotions I had a child. A sort of empty sadness/badness at my mother's mental struggle, and sorrow for how much she suffers from it. In the past I'd probably try to cheer myself up or distract myself, because I really don't want to give my mother's mental health struggles any more of a grasp on my own mental health than they already do. But maybe that's part of my repression, and not actually healthy. I dunno.

Is it acceptable (or good) to just sit with a sadness when you're feeling it? Without going for distractions like food/treats/TV/gaming/exercise/hobbies etc?

Or is just sitting on an emotion for no sake other than to feel it unhealthy dwelling/ruminating?"
CPTSD,Why is incest so painful?,"I've been through a lot of trauma in my life but the most painful is the incest. Ultimate betrayal and it's fucked me up sexually too. You don't ever get over it. Animals know not to commit incest and they're animals. Yet humans know it's wrong and still do it. The trauma, pain, and aftermath of incest is just really painful."
CPTSD,How to acknowledge triggers & when triggered to get your self out,"I have been struggling with certain things that trigger me when my significant other talks to me a certain way & I donâ€™t always catch it . When I donâ€™t I just end up getting triggered & my mind goes to that fighting defense part of my brain. This has been a struggling in several relationships I have had & I just want to get better. 

Side note: complaining is usually what triggers me or blunt comments is usually how I am triggered."
CPTSD,Thank you,"Three years ago I joined this sub after being diagnosed. I went to therapy for two years, really lucked out with a medication combination that worked for me right away and have had a supportive husband through it all. 

During this time I had some family issues I won't get into, but 10 years ago I wouldn't of been able to cope as healthy as I do now. I cant remember the last time I had a PTSD attack. They used to happen weekly. 

This group has been a huge supportive and has helped me know I am not alone. Despite the shitty things that happen to use, they do not define us. Healing isn't linear and I don't consider it a destination but a continuous journey. You are all amazing and I hope you find ways to feel joy each and every day"
CPTSD,chronic fatigue from being stuck in fight or flight mode for 20 years,"havenâ€™t had adderall in a week (luckily Iâ€™m getting more soon) but without adderall or caffeine I sleep all day and still have no energy and can barely function in general

CPTSD,What's the Difference Between Fine and Numb?,"I don't think I can tell anymore. If I know I ""should"" be feeling something I know that's numb but otherwise no clue.

Am I fine when I sit on a park bench or numb? When I feel no emotion through out my day is that being fine? When I look back at my life and all the ""achievements"" I supposedly have and feel nothing is that being fine with it or numb to existence. 

When people describe their motivations for consuming cannabis they mention a detached from the universe I'm surprised they need a chemical for. Is me being in that state constantly a boon or curse?"
CPTSD,They got kicked out,The people that made my life a living hell for two years got kicked out of the house. I feel free
CPTSD,I dislike being alone in solitude with my own thoughts because all it does is lead to trauma filled memories and negative thinking.,"I am not sure if anyone goes through this, but for myself I never understood just sitting there alone in your thoughts. It gets promoted by people as a positive self-care thing outside, I can never do it. I do not understand how people can sit there alone with their thoughts and feel okay. It isnâ€™t like I hate being alone either, I just hate sitting there doing â€œnothingâ€ because as a trauma survivor if I am not distracting myself my mind starts to dig through negative thoughts very easily and quickly. Then next thing I know Iâ€™m being retraumatized all over again."
CPTSD,Need Advice,"Iâ€™m willing to put in the work, and Iâ€™ve made significant progress, but it feels like Iâ€™m drowning. 

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m grieving, burned out, or some of both, but Iâ€™ve constantly felt like I was treading water for the past couple of years. My heart just feels broken. I make myself, but I donâ€™t want to get out of bed. I try really hard to count my blessings (because I still have a lot to be grateful for) but every aspect of life feels like a chore. Everything just feels soâ€¦.dull? I just feel disconnected from everything and everyone, aside from very few people. Itâ€™s also destroyed previously very close friendships. 

I want to take action and accountability where I can make changes, while also accepting what I cannot. Iâ€™m tired of living like this. But, I find that forcing myself to just â€œpush throughâ€ and â€œfake itâ€ is only burning me out further. The stress is causing both severe anxiety and exhaustion. 

I feel cringe just writing this. But it feels safer to talk about things with strangers, especially strangers who â€œget it.â€

Has anyone been here and fought their way out? I just need some hope. I want my life back, so badly."
CPTSD,Where to Start?,"I am certain that I have CPTSD, but I donâ€™t even know where to start for getting diagnosed and trying some medications other than talking to my therapist and starting from there. 

For some reason, Iâ€™ve been very reluctant to even have this conversation with my (trauma based, highly trained in EMDR and somatic modalities) therapist. It feels like an uphill battle to get an official diagnosis and medication, and that deters me from the start.

I grew up in a household where I experienced and witnessed all manners of abuse by my narcissist and BPD and alcoholic dad. I left my home state over a decade ago, but he moved 9 doors down from me and my partner three months ago, and the trauma memory floods and triggers have been â€¦ very overwhelming since. 

Just hoping to hear some words of encouragement and/or advice from those who are further down the road. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for 17 years with success in EMDR, journaling, and somatic experiencing. However that was for working through relationship issues and treating generalized anxiety disorder. It wasnâ€™t until 2020 that I started to learn about and suspect I have CPTSD. 

Thanks in advance for any encouragement!"
CPTSD,What do people do in their free time?,"I used to dissociate out of the wazoo and play video games.

Nowadays I'm doing much better, and during my free time I learn something new or study something to advance in my career.

What do regular people do with their free time? Do they also take on random projects or do they like have more fulfilling social lives or something? I am alone during most of my free time."
CPTSD,Why is it always so hard to accept advice? *seeking advice,"Does anyone else feel this way? I only feel this way towards certain people in my life and I always end up getting triggered then reacting defensively/negatively instead of processing it.

My body goes into fight or flight mode so quickly that Iâ€™m unable to catch it in time for me to say something so stupid.

I think this is one aspect that I really need to work on so any advice would help. I promise Iâ€™ll try to not get defensive lmao ðŸ¥²

Iâ€™m at wits end everytime an outburst happen. It makes me feel like going to therapy is such a waste of time if Iâ€™m going to keep being this way. I know that therapy is only a tool and I need to put it to practice to see changes, but my brain is so slow at processing and perhaps I need to change something in the way I do things.

I dunno man, Iâ€™m rambling now. But Iâ€™d really love to hear your thoughts as Iâ€™m feeling helpless."
CPTSD,"dumb question, but once you start figuring shit out can you block it back up again??","figured out I'm a bit more fucked up than I thought over christmas and now I'm back away from the childhood home and I need to concentrate on studying with some urgency (plus just living by myself is hard >.>). I used to never even think of this shit and redirect around it automatically but now my dumbass brain can't stop turning over things and chucking up memories in the middle of the day without a trigger.

was doing better before this, but now I'm distracted from the stuff I really need to do and idk how to stop it. help? any good techniques?"
CPTSD,I'm so nervous about seeing a new therapist,"I have my first appointment in person with a new therapist this week. She had me fill out an intake form with my psychiatric history online and seeing my history written out like that made me feel so much shame. 

I'm afraid she's going to tell me I'm a helpless case, that I don't want to get better and her time would be better spent helping others. Or maybe she won't be equipped to help me or won't understand what my problem is. 

It was really hard for me to get up the courage to seek out more help and I'm feeling like if it doesn't work out I'll be devastated and I can't take one more hit right now, I'm already at a very low point. I know I need support and I'm so scared that I'm about to learn it isn't available or possible or I don't deserve it.

I know this is a cognitive distortion, I'm only considering what can go wrong, not what could go right. But if I imagine what could go right, I'll be even more crushed if it doesn't. 

This feels so vulnerable. I've always believed I could get better but I guard that little spark of hope very carefully and I feel like I just threw the door open and all the wind is blowing in and I don't know what will happen. It's like I'm throwing myself on the mercy of this person I don't know and I have no reason to trust. It feels like such a gamble."
CPTSD,Does anyone just feel like they donâ€™t belong anywhere?,"I donâ€™t know how to explain it fullyâ€¦ but I feel like I donâ€™t belong in most groups or spaces. Even if the situations or experiences may be relatable, I just donâ€™t feel like I belong fully like Iâ€™m an imposter infiltrating the spaces somehow. I tried many social and support groups, subreddits, online and in person groups. None of them I truly feel like I belong and this isnâ€™t on other people. I just feel really alien in life that I feel isolated in social circles. I hate this feeling. I have too many marginalized identities and too many comorbidities that itâ€™s difficult to find a place to belong I think."
CPTSD,Does anyone have a story about how they got to success from survival mode?,"Hello everyone:) I'm kind of ""waking up"" for the first time of my life since I have been in survival mode for so long.

Thank you :)"
CPTSD,Iâ€™m going to be really honest and I want honest but not mean feedback please,So i am in a long term committed relationship that neither of us are happy in and itâ€™s my fault. I am a 19 year old and over the last few years Iâ€™ve recognized bitter anger is a theme in my life. My partner was not nice to me in the past and would often call me names belittle me and admitted to saying hurtful things solely for the purpose of hurting me. That stopped about 8 months ago and sheâ€™s in therapy now for her own issues. Since then Iâ€™ve developed my own issues specifically with anger and if Iâ€™m being 1000% honest Iâ€™m regularly angry and yell at my partner over little things and often to the point my heart pounds. On top of this the shame of guilt often leads to blame shifting and trying to flip the script. When we met I was calm collected and could deal with just about anything without raising my voice. Iâ€™d like to blame my anger  partially on how I was treated in the past and how often the only time sheâ€™d stop calling me names was if I yelled at her and demanded she stopped but that isnâ€™t the sole contributor.  This is no longer the case but now every time a situation arises I start yelling at her and it isnâ€™t okay. I also have recognized I am treating my partner in similar ways that I saw my father treat his partner and my partner and I regularly trigger each others past truama. My question is what do I do? How do I stop getting triggered by my partner and how do I stop perpetuating the behavior of my father.
CPTSD,I don't trust hetero men,"Hello,

let me preface this by the following: I've never experienced any serious sexual harrassment or assault, at least not that I can remember. I'm an asexual woman, so I've never had any sexual experience or interest, either. 

The thing is, I'm extremely wary of men. I have a lot of guy friends and I'm 99% sure none of them have any romantic or sexual interest in me. I've gone on a few dates with (mostly) asexual men, but even with the asexual ones, there was always that voice in my head that told me not to trust them, that they might want to take advantage of me or even sexually assault me. It's so weird because I really don't think I'm especially attractive, but I know that sexual assault has little to do with sex or attraction, so it wouldn't matter anyway.

I usually just live my life keeping my hetero male friends at a bit of a distance. I **know** rationally that none of them pose any threats, but I **feel** differently. My problem now is that I have a good friend (we've known each other over 10 years now) who moved away a few years ago and he's been asking me to come visit him forever. He wants me to stay at his place, but because of this issue I've avoided visiting him - but I actually would want to! But there's this voice in the back of my head telling me that it could be dangerous and he could do anything he wanted if I stayed at his place. Doesn't help that he's a big, strong guy with a high sex drive lol but he knows I'm asexual and has never shown any interest and I'm definitely not his type. And let's pretend for a moment that he is interested, I **know** that he'd still not hurt me like that. There was never anything indicating that he'd overstep any boundaries with me, he has a girlfriend (who doesn't live with him), so I know it's irrational to fear him. The worst part is, I'm so ashamed about it that I can't bring it up in therapy.

I do feel this with lesbian friends just a little bit as well - but because they're women and physically not as intimidating I'm better at ignoring those fears, I think.

Can anyone relate? I feel like it's sooo irrational that I can't bring it up in therapy, I'm ashamed about it, but I'm not sure why... Is this just my regular trust issues taking up a very bold fom? Or is this something different? I probably should bring this up in therapy, right?

My mother experienced a lot of creepy men in her life (she sometimes talks a bit about it but I don't think she's ever told me everything) and she is always extremely wary, telling me to be cautious, etc., so maybe it's really her fears I integrated as mine?

Any advice is welcome, especially encouragement to talk about this in therapy."
CPTSD,Im contemplating suicide,"Everytime it always leads to this. I feel like life has its positive parts but it always feels like the negative outweighs it. Everything that comes up in life always leads back to my trauma in some way. Its all connected, it makes me who i am and i hate that for me. I wish things were different but i just knkw one day, i will die from suicide. I just dont know when."
CPTSD,Said no to my mom for the first time [update] she is mad,"I got to talk with my younger sibling today, I asked if Mom was upset that I didn't 100% comply to her request. She laughed and said she had been complaining to everyone she could about it. I told her I didn't actually outright say no, I said I could do 1 of the 3 days a week she wants me to dog-sit, I would make home visits to the dog on the second day and Id cover half of whatever dog sitting service she needs for the third day (which btw I didn't NEED to offer her at all!) My sibling laughed and said she made it seem like I said no *and* to go fxck herself. 

See I have learned that a lack of planning on her part, does *not* make it emergency on mine. My boundaries may be  loosey goosey but for the first time at least they are *there*. She hasn't started any sort of dialogue with me since. She hasn't communicated she is upset with me. I don't feel guilty. I don't play these emotional games anymore."
CPTSD,Is attention seeking a bad thing?,"This is more of a kind of thought prompt as its not based on a real situation or anything, but I was wondering what you all think about the concept of attention seeking, and whether or not you believe it to be a negative or positive trait.

Obviously, being ""attention seeking"" is often used as an insult. Something as innocent as wearing alternative fashion makes you a desperate attention seeker, as does something as big as attempting to take your own life. It's always used in a negative context, as if seeking attention is one of the most shameful things you could do as a person.

As people with cptsd, attention is something several of us were particularly lacking in our lives, or we received a lot of the wrong kind of attention. A lot of traumatized people isolate to avoid *any* kind of attention, while some may use manipulative behaviors to obtain as much attention as possible, sometimes unintentionally. 

Do you believe that there is a middle ground of attention seeking behavior that is healthy and normal? Is attention seeking at its core an unhealthy trait? What healthy ways do you think people can seek attention, if it's possible to do so?"
CPTSD,How do I make the chaos stop?,"I feel so chaotic.

CPTSD,A poem about my narc father,"You always play the victim. 

You never take accountability for your actions and you hurt those around you. 

Itâ€™s all about you. 

The victim in every story. 

Perfectly scripted to fit your narrative. 

Honestly,

For a while it was believable. 

I wanted to think you were a good person. 

A good man. 

A good father. 

Good.

But,

In what way are you any of those things? 

You have never really been there for me. 

Not actually. 

Youâ€™d pretend to be. 

Pretend that you loved and cared for me.

It was all an act.

It was all a game. 

You play it so well,

Donâ€™t you? 

But,

I believed it. 

I fell for it all. 

I was an impressionable child who wanted to love his father no matter what.

A child who viewed his dad as the hero in his own little story. 

The story you made up to make people pity you.

The courts were against you,

CPS was against you,

My mom was against you,

Everyone was against you.

But,

You did nothing wrong right?

You never did a single thing wrong right?

All those times police were called you were the victim.

All those times you tried to hurt yourself to make us feel bad? 

Youâ€™re the victim right? 

Always playing the victim when youâ€™re in fact the abuser. 

A wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing-

The perfect disguise to hide your true intentions. 

Youâ€™re a horrible person. 

A horrible man.

A horrible father. 

Horrible.

You were never the victim. 

You just spun the story to make it seem like you were."
CPTSD,CPTSD and hormones,"Any people here that also dealt with PTSD or C-PTSD

Been diagnosed with C-PTSD but never been able to find a capable psychologist.

Been finding out about the hormonal issues they can create.

So I started doing blood test.
Progesterone
Non existent. 
Shows why I'm always In a estrogen domimant state.
Pregnenolone was low even though I'm supplementing.
DHEA-S was high.

Always in poor state of metabolic health.
TSH 2.7 which is okay but always had High RT3 and low middle FT3
Can really easily get into a state of insulin resistance.

Really funny how such mental problems can get down to your hormones

I'm on TRT and it has been hell.
Struggling so hard balancing hormones it's almost impossible.
Only can lose weight on low estrogen otherwise my body just holds on to everything."
CPTSD,Did I experience a dissociative episode?,"A few years ago, I was very stressed and a conversation triggered me and I dissociated. 

Itâ€™s as though I lost control and became self destructive and started making impulsive decisions like calling and messaging people to seek validation and attention which I wouldnâ€™t normally do. Or self sabotaged. 

I experienced dissociative amnesia and mentally blacked out and all of a sudden I was on the phone talking to someone I knew, but I couldnâ€™t recall sending a spam of messages etc because I experienced depersonalisation and paranoia. 

Then, itâ€™s as though I â€œblinkedâ€ and came back to normal /reality after a few days and I remembered what happened when my friend told me after a few months."
CPTSD,Anyone else wish there was a way to debate exiting logically somewhere online?,"Everyone is so weird about death and treats it like some kind of sadness thing that just needs a dose of saccharine bullshit to cheer you back up. But these days it's just more and more a logical proposition. And the ""arguments"" most people post are little more than aphorisms and folk heuristics, neither of which can stand up against logic. 

So since there's nowhere to discuss it, there's no counter to the arguments I'm constantly weighed with, which means they operate unchallenged. 

The strange refusal people have with discussing death and suicide is not helping me avoid death and suicide. 

And no, the people at those numbers are not equipped for an academic-style logical debate."
CPTSD,Therapist is moving on and I'm not really ok with it,"This is my fourth time writing this post. Maybe this time I won't just close the window.

My therapist emailed me yesterday to tell me she has accepted a new job and won't be seeing patients any longer. My thoughts are all over the place at this point and I don't know what I'm going to do.

I know she is an adult and our relationship is strictly business and she can make any career choice she likes. She doesn't owe me any care or long term anything. 

At the same time, I'm feeling hurt, angry, abandoned. I'm not sure if I want to do a 'termination session' or just reply and cancel our next session.

I don't feel like I have it in me to go through the 'lets go over your trauma history' with another therapist at this point.

The last few sessions I've felt like things have become argumentative - I was thinking this was me, that I'm resisting progress - wondering what the point of therapy even was... but now I'm wondering if she has been only partially present because she's been on the search for a job. 

Now that I think about it, in our last session, she was dressed much more 'business-like' than usual, which makes me think she had an interview that day and got the job offer yesterday. 

Of course the intrusive thoughts are coming on strong - maybe she got sick of dealing with me and the only way to get out was to go find another job. Maybe she doesn't have another job and she just wants to get rid of me with an excuse that she won't have to say that I'm too shitty a patient to deal with."
CPTSD,Alcohol consumption,"Ive decided to give up drinking alcohol. I wasnt a huge drinker but its something ive been thinking about for a few months. It serves no purpose to me, i feel like i saught it out when i was st my lowest point or need it for confidence. Im now in a place where im craving it for when i feel low and thats just not good. I guess its time for me to move on from it. It helped me in times of need but i cant rely on it anymore."
CPTSD,No therapist? Check in.,I just wanna say there's no better feeling than doing it yourself.
CPTSD,What to do when you run out of options?,"\[Oh my, this got long. Apologies, feel free to skim, even as I'll leave it for anyone who wants to wade through.\]

There isn't going to be a magic solution here but I wonder if people might have ideas.

I'm 62. In my late forties it started to be clear that the problem wasn't, as I'd always thought, just that I wasn't smart enough or hard working enough or that I was just fundamentally broken. I had an absolutely awful time getting off of antidepressants, over time they made me terribly ill and numbed out and then even more ill during four years of withdrawal. In that time I was referred to a therapist--a psychoanalyst but not for actual analysis. It was far and away the most vulnerable time of my adult life and I became way, way too dependent on this guy and could not see at the time that he was actually encouraging (manipulating) me into being that way. Including convincing me I should come twice and then three times a week for a few years. I was absolutely convinced that this brilliant man had the royal road to healing and stuck with it for nine years. Yes, nine. And then I was, after being stuck and unemployed for most of that time, finally out of money. When I told him I needed to take a break until I could make some money he hit the roof. As in, literally red in the face, ""No one does this to me!"" It turns out he has hurt others and I don't think malignant narcissist is too strong a term. The worst of it (as if that's not bad enough) is that it was a recapitulation in many ways of what had happened to me as a kid. My mother was (as much as I'm wary of the term, which can be pretty stigmatizing) borderline and profoundly manipulative. Well, also brilliant. Hence the blinders that kept me from seeing the therapy abuse.

Along the way, I had also tried psychedelic therapy. In part because I thought I had this amazing, rock solid therapist behind me. It did help me got off the antidepressants but I got caught up in two psychedelic communities that, again, I couldn't see, were really not good at all. (The leaders of one community actually had an entire podcast on Spotify built around their abusive behavior.) Same blinders, same, or at least similar, recapitiulation.

What else to say? I somehow started to pull myself together and gradually over several years go from being a complete wreck to being in a lot of ways pretty good but way way too isolated and still unemployed. Friends kind of peeled away and I had trouble making new ones. I had the awful luck of selling my house just before the pandemic--in order to spend time in a Zen monastery, that also turned out to be pretty awful--and finally, with some recent inheritance, managed last summer to just be able to buy a small house (prices really skyrocketed here) that needs work last summer after having temporary rentals and house-sitting for three years. But it appears that having my own home again, especially one that needs a lot of work, is not giving me the platform for a final rebuilding phase that I had hoped. And it's winter here in New England which is really tough and I cannot seem to even get a job. The cptsd, narrow window of tolerance and all that, plus having a stellar resume (three Ivy League degrees) that just fell off a cliff twelve years ago, all becomes terribly limiting. And I keep getting dinged from even really basic jobs--like coffee shops or part-time driving people to medical appointments at a retirement community. I think people see my resume and think, WTF? and just toss it.

Oh right. I should say that after all that, I probably had 8 or 10 false starts with new therapist in the last several years. The good ones are few and far between, and my history and resistance and lack of money makes it incredibly hard to find a good match. I finally worked for the past year with a youngish guy who does internal family systems. I like him and trust him, but I cannot seem to get anywhere with IFS. The deeper stuff is just totally buried over now. And even if I could, I'm back to being seriously out of money. All three of my siblings, all older, care and would like to help (well...sort of...to a point), but I can feel all the old family dynamics still there and feel like I can't take it anymore. (Like, for example, they have between them probably between 10 and 20 million dollars. When I was frantically trying to find a small, cheap place to buy they would say things like ""I wish I could help!"")

Oh right, last thing. (Sorry for the length!) I decided to apply for a masters of divinity program. No, I'm not at all capital-R religious, but I do think that with the shit storm going down in the world there's widespread spiritual crisis (not least as the religion of capitalism falls apart...) and really important work to do in that regard, and also I tend to think the main thing I really need is just some decent, interesting people to be around who are not afraid to talk about the big questions in life. So maybe that will work? But the process was incredibly grueling getting the application together, with a lot riding on it, especially the scholarship aid--the application needed to be really good. And I got kind of frantic....just a little at the end, but enough that I made a choice for my academic writing sample that wasn't great...not terrible, but not what I should've chosen, and you would not believe the way my internal critic came out late that night and just beat the crap out of me. And since then, well, it's winter, and I have no friends, and I'm broke, and it's getting hard to see a way out and I've been really depressed and that window of tolerance has narrowed. And sort of cabin-fever late at night in a kind of scary way, and there's something more than depression...kind of a turmoil....in my head at times. Not dramatic, but it feels kinda bad. All of which I know can change, but the fact is that there's this objective component of...getting old, no money, can't get it together, and...WTFingF is next?

I've done some humanitarian aid work in a remote part of southern AZ with immigrants and know there are people there who'd welcome me back and I could buy a cheaper house and have some money for a while to keep working on things but sheesh, I don't really want to go live among cacti in the middle of nowhere. Oof! Any thoughts?"
CPTSD,I want to run away,I want to run away and never come back. Everyone lies to me. I want my life to end before it ever begins. I never know if I truly want to change or die. I'm a joke to everyone and people I try to get close to are just in for the ride of my life getting out of control.
CPTSD,Does anyone else get a tight/sore throat and constricted speech when youâ€™re nervous and talking to people?,"If so, did anything help you remedy it? Iâ€™ve noticed sometimes that my voice sounds really different when talking to people. It gets higher and tighter sounding, and rougher. My throat gets sore too. Iâ€™m wondering if this is linked to anxiety. Iâ€™m hoping to find a cure or remedy for this!"
CPTSD,What was your family structure/dynamic growing up and what challenges have you had to overcome/are overcoming?,"E.g.: I grew up for the most part with a sole parent (my mother) with 2 younger siblings. There was a phase in our lives where we had to live with our grandparents while my mom worked abroad to provide for us. This led to a lot of complicated family dynamics, and I've also had to witness, experience, unearth and heal a lot of generational trauma from our family bloodline. 

I want to learn about what everyone's family structures were like so that I can understand about the different ways trauma manifests in society's foundational unit, and ways how children cope and survive in a world that doesn't always come easy for unconventional family structures - some examples:

- Two parents, one parent, extended family, foster family
- Only child, child among multiple/a lot of siblings
- Grew up in an adoption center
- Ran away from home and built a life of own
- Etc. Someone's story I haven't learned about yet"
CPTSD,I keep thinking about taking the rest of all of my medications,"I feel like I should tell my boyfriend, but I'm embarrassed. Or think that it would just sound like I'm looking for attention. Sometimes it gets really hard to fight the urge. I have several antipsychotics and antidepressants. I feel ashamed just making this post but...I guess I thought it might help."
CPTSD,Finally got diagnosed!,"So after struggling with my mental health and not knowing wtf is wrong with me for 21 years, Iâ€™ve finally been diagnosed with CPTSD today. Healing starts now feeling hopeful about the future for the first time in a while ðŸ¤žðŸ¼"
CPTSD,Iâ€™m so fucking mad that my parents shitty parenting has resulted in me not being able to form relationships.,"What a fucking prison.

Go fuck your self, Amanda. Stupid bitch."
CPTSD,Today is a good day,"Today I have spent the day doing some work to help myself feel more secure and independent. 

I realized I was independent and I felt amazing. I was secure and felt on top of the world and no one could hold me back. 

Then my ex had me spiral, because I had done all this work to be independent and secure but then because of this he felt codependent and became distant. 

I said enough. Nothing I do will be enough for this person to treat me right when I was feeling good. 

I got out and was healing. Met someone again who was everything I was hoping for. Then again I found myself feeling insecure even though I do love myself. 

I donâ€™t want his mood, words or actions to have such an impact on me. So I am taking a step back and really focusing on what I love about myself, what I want to work on, and what I want to do to feel independent and secure. 

Iâ€™m emphasizing â€œI wantâ€ because I am not doing this for anyone except for me. I am not doing this to be worthy of love from anyone. I am worthy of love and doing these things for myself is me showing myself love and care that I donâ€™t need from anyone else."
CPTSD,How do I handle a difference of opinion?,"Hey, So I'm on extended work project with a mentor or sorts and she's nutty, and about 4 days into our 10 day trip, she has pissed me off twice.  I'm trying to remember that I'm not perfect but I feel like something is wrong with me if this is the only friend that I can be with - she told me a story of how she didn't tell her best friend that she initially slept with her boyfriend when they first met.  Said she felt upset but everyone she spoke to said not to tell her, that they stopped cheating and the 2 women became such good friends.  Today, when talking about politics, she said that Trump is better than Biden. She said Biden looks scary and is a pedophile. I got so triggered and I walked out of the room abruptly - I said that I wondered if she was even smart after some of the comments she makes about this and about vaccines.  I reminded her that Trump took away abortion and he has assaulted so many women, and she said Biden is worse.

I have to stay with her to keep working on the project - it's not negotiable and it's for work.  How do people smooth things over and move on? I don't have to be best friends with her after this (and I'm not) but do you have any ideas for how to love forward without my feeling so angry? Thanks!"
CPTSD,i feel so lonely,"iâ€™ve isolated myself pretty badly in an attempt to save myself from being hurt but now i have no one. i know this is my doing and that i should work on asking for help and being vulnerable but i wish someone would reach out and show me their love and care, i feel like itâ€™d help me feel a bit better so i can take the proper steps towards healing. i know no oneâ€™s gonna do the healing for me, but i just want community or at least someone who supports me and shows me love and care. iâ€™m trying to be that person for myself but it feels so fake and i just canâ€™t anymore. iâ€™m so tired of always having to pick up all my broken pieces by myself. iâ€™m in a horrible depression, i quit my job and am just having a hard time continuing. depression on top of trauma and probably some other mental illnesses is so hard to escape, i just want people to encourage me instead of having to encourage myself all the time."
CPTSD,Repressed memory of first instance of abuse has somewhat surfaced,"Hi all, 
I have a history of CSA in my childhood that was ongoing and repeated for about 7-8 years. My abuser is now in prison and won't see the light of day again.  I got my ""justice."" I'm thankful he is no longer in my life actively, don't get me wrong. But im still effected by this immensely, and I haven't been abused in 14 years. I am in trauma therapy currently, and have been experiencing some anger/ resentment at my mother, because part of me thinks she new about the abuse.  

I've always been under the impression that I knew when the abuse started.  I had it vividly in my brain.  I was in kindergarten. But today, out of nowhere, I am having flashes of the abuse starting even younger than i remembered.  I think I was 4ish based on where this happened. It's very distressing. It's not a complete memory and is very fuzzy.. could my brain have made this up? 

Why can't I just get over this? I can't go back and change what happened to me.  I just want to move on and no longer be consumed by what happened. I don't want to be a victim."
CPTSD,Do you always feel like youâ€™re going to die for being alive,"Not like dying as in to be killed by someone or something, but like because you exist youâ€™ll be punished for it in some cosmic sort of way?

Iâ€™ve been trying to settle with hypervigilance and itâ€™s so hard because I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m afraid of. I know how to fight back and protect myself when needed, I can differentiate safety and danger for the most part, but Iâ€™m just scared of something thatâ€™s somehow bigger than being verbally or physically abused. It sucks"
CPTSD,I feel like I just woke up,"Like what just happened in the past 30 years? For example why did I study something I never wanted to study and why am I still working in this field even though I knew from the start that Iâ€™m not good at this and I donâ€™t like what Iâ€™m doing and the working times donâ€™t suit me. Like wtf I knew when I was 7 yrs old that Iâ€™m not a morning person and in my current occupation I must wake up early and there are dozens of occupations in the world in which I could use my skills that are not the ones I need in my current occupation. 

I feel like living another personâ€™s life and it feels devastating. What a waste of my precious little life!

Do you ever feel like everythingâ€™s gone so wrong and you seem to have had no power over what just happened in the past?"
CPTSD,Help a friend with CPTSD,"My friend has CPTSD, yesterday I told him that on Monday we were going to watch a show together that I like and he doesn't. But this made him feel bad because he has anhedonia and doesn't feel like doing anything, and it was also a reminder that we don't have as many hobbies in common as he would like, which has worried him a lot since the beginning of our relationship, as for him, this is something very important, because some of his hobbies have been his safe space throughout his life and it is very important for him to share this with me.

At the same time, this situation made him feel bad, because it made him kind of reconsider our relationship and its difficulties. He wants me to be able to ask him to do things that I want and he wants to do them with me, but it is difficult to manage. Do you have any type of tool or advice to better manage similar situations?


I also would like to understand and help him with his CPTSD so, any guide, tool, book, video, advice or whatever you can share with me, I'll be glad."
CPTSD,The constant struggle for money makes me want to end it nearly every day.,"Iâ€™m just so fed up with this struggle. If it werenâ€™t for my partner, Iâ€™d be homeless because money just doesnâ€™t stay with me that long. Everything is so ungodly expensive and thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll ever be able to afford a home of my own. The fact that I work full time at a job that robs me of ANY energy at the end of the day and STILL have nothing to keep once everything is paid/food is purchasedâ€¦ I just feel fucking hopeless. Not only do I have to work that much harder just to feel some sort of stable normalcy in my life due to my upbringing, I have to work even *harder* just to survive and feel somewhat above homelessness/having nothing. I hate money with a burning passion. I hate what it has done to all of us. I just want to have some stability and a chance to just live my lifeâ€” is this really too much to ask for??"
CPTSD,"I keep ""faking it"" in therapy - IFS? Self help? Something else?","I have had tried various therapists over my life although I have never really had success. There seems to be a bit of a script I follow.

\*

1.) I talk about the present situation e.g. stress at work, relationship problems etc.

2.) I reveal a big past trauma and I ""work through"" it with them. In reality, speaking about it is not difficult as I intellectualise. The validation feels good, but the progress is always temporary and I am avoiding what I really need to speak about. I think I do this to show they've earned my trust and to feel like I am doing well at therapy.

3.) I get into the childhood stuff, but its just telling the story and getting validation again. I struggle with the ""what next?"" part of it all. ""Reparenting myself"" or ""accepting that my parents couldn't be what I needed and grieving that loss"" is so depressing that it sends me spiralling. I find a lot of it, like inner child work to be... embarrassing? Cheesy? Shameful?. The feeling is so intense that I feel like I'm not actually present and I pretend to engage instead of engaging. I pretend to have feelings I don't, to find value in techniques I don't like, and pretend that they've missed the mark when they've hit it.

4.) I run out of stories to tell. I go back to talking about the day to day things. It gets really repetitive. I start thinking they're bored/angry. I pretend that I'm making progress so I'll be a ""good"" client.

5.) Either:

a.) They realise what I'm doing and call me out. ""You never seem to disagree with me"" etc. Usually I will defend myself vehemently, insisting that they've got it wrong. I start disagreeing with them more in sessions so they'll like me but often I'm pretending to disagree. Within a few sessions, I will suddenly develop a strong dislike for them for seemingly no reason and I will pretend I am better so I can end therapy without dealing with it.

b.) They don't realise what I'm doing and we continue for a while, me spending a huge amount of my income to turn up every week and lie for no reason and then eventually I make an excuse to end it.

\*

I know all of this is really manipulative of me, but I don't want to do it and I can't seem to stop. Every single time I start therapy with the intention of it being different. As I get towards the end of the script, I vow to be more truthful and let them see the ""uglier"" parts of me but in the moment I feel like I can't physically get the words out. I actually think it's a fawn response and I'm struggling to break it.

I have recently read about IFS and it both sounds like the kind of thing that would trigger my embarrassment/shame intensely but also the kind of thing I really like the idea of. I am worried that I will just do the same pattern I always do and it will be a complete waste of money. Therefore, I am also considering whether self-help would be worthwhile. Has anyone tried and was it effective? Is there a kind of therapy I can do on myself that works well for trauma?"
CPTSD,Resilience River,"When you feel powerless, think Niagara Falls: I wrote this [article](https://sipwsarah.medium.com/resilience-river-a380b0ac047a) about a dream I had that really helped me process some of my CPTSD symptoms. Iâ€™m sharing this in hopes it might help someone in here too."
CPTSD,Parents with CPTSD-how do you make sure you're the healthiest you for your kid?,"Desperately want children, but acutely aware of the trauma symptoms I have that make me worried if I would be good enough. Brining another soul into this world is a big deal already, add on cptsd and a plethora of health symptoms.

CPTSD,Any other Audiobooks like â€œIâ€™m glad my mom died by Jennette McCurdyâ€?,"Ive listened to some of body keeps the score and heard of similar clinical types but never have I felt so seen while listening to any book, like I did with Jennettes books. Especially since she narrated it so she gave it all the correct inflections to really make the audience feel they were there. She was really good at mimicking how people spoke when quoting them. 

Is there another book like this out there with an emotionally abusive mother? Hopefully one with good narration? â¤ï¸"
CPTSD,I hate myself,"I hate being mem everyone is depressed dismissive or cold.
My mother is deoressed my friends, im depressed, I had yo leave my ex because relationship was toxic.
I have noone and I am tired. I don't want to feel myself.
Im feeling too much. Im tired  im not suicidal but I feel shame and guilt for existing.
I effect people around me negatively. I feel empty. I have diagnoses. I feel everything is slipping. There's nothing warm in this world."
CPTSD,I donâ€™t know what to do now (tw: possible assault),"hi all, 

When I was 6 and 12 years old, my cousin assaulted me at various times. I am now 22F and I  think I completely blocked this out of my head, but I remember everything else since I saw him recently. (And i do not want to again)

The first time this happened I was six and he was 5 and I remember him feeling very confused because he did not stop kissing me and I did not know was going on and then he started touching me that made me even more confused (keep in mind this time I was not aware of sex or sexual actions) but I do remember it feeling wrong. Iâ€™m not sure of this account as assault because I feel like if I tell someone people are gonna be like all thatâ€™s just kids exploring each other.

Then there was us at 12 and 11, and we both had more knowledge and I think a lot of stuff similar to what happened to me when I was younger happened to various months and it was just slightly more escalated, penetration didnâ€™t happen but there was one time that I feel like if he didnâ€™t hear someone coming upstairs it would have happened. I think I remember myself saying stop, and he never listen to me and i felt so helpless.

I am not sure what to do now as this is still coming back to me, I donâ€™t even know if he remembers or maybe he just blocked it out like I did."
CPTSD,Why was i so unimportant to my friends?,Like I can't understand it. I thought they were genuine people. I thought they would care about me if i opened up to them. But nobody wondered and got concerned about me. They continued like nothing ever happened. I thought they would come and save me. But nobody did. It still hurts..
CPTSD,anyone else feel like something happened to them as a child but never really sure,"Ever since I was 6 or 7 I have remembered having a weird relationship with sex & my body, I donâ€™t have any memories of things happening to me but I do remember knowing far more about sex, masturbation etc. than my peers and wanting to do intimate sexual things from about 8 years old, so much that I was compulsively thinking about sex for a long time and ended up in some pretty dangerous situations as a teenager because of it itâ€™s been really haunting me looking back and I feel so much shame around it, I just feel so uneasy I have no clue how i knew all of that stuff and Iâ€™m convinced i mustâ€™ve been exposed to something early? Thereâ€™s just this gut feeling that something was happening that wasnâ€™t okay. 
Anyone else had this feeling?"
CPTSD,will you ever tell your parents what they did to you?,"will you ever attempt to explain to your parents that they caused your cptsd? or have you already?

especially if they caused it when you were younger and have become less abusive or no longer abusive now that youâ€™re older."
CPTSD,When youâ€™re seen as a jerk for detachment.,Anyone else ever been shamed at family gatherings for being â€œdisrespectfulâ€ for being uninterested or not happy on command line a dog?
CPTSD,I am selfish,"Iâ€™ll start by saying that I know I am wrong. But I feel like I canâ€™t continue without feeling nobody loves me. 

I know I have to love myself. I know is selfish to pretend to only continue through the â€œloveâ€ of others. But I have a â€œnormalâ€ life. I donâ€™t live constantly hidden in my house. But I have kiss no one in my life, the only erotic memories I have are rooted in the sexual abuses I suffered as a child and I just canâ€™t continue. 

I know is selfish. But I am just tired of seeing romantic â€œthingsâ€ everywhere and knowing I am just all alone and that no one cant do anything as the â€œloveâ€ I need has ti be genuine and not out of pitty (or money).

Sorry, I just really bad right now."
CPTSD,One of my triggers is rude responses to questions I ask,"I think I just found another trigger of mine. Whenever I ask someone a genuine question, but they give me a short response that doesnâ€™t even answer the question. Their response acts both like Iâ€™m stupid, but also they wonâ€™t answer the question. 
I get this in emails, with friends, etc. Most recently (currently) Iâ€™m getting this with a mod of another subreddit who removed one of my posts, but wonâ€™t answer why. Iâ€™ve read every rule, but I canâ€™t find a single issue with my post. I literally just want to know why so I can avoid it again (and Iâ€™ve told them this!! 3 times!!), but they wonâ€™t. 
Im just trying to remind myself that people like this are exactly the people Iâ€™m trying to avoid in life. I want to reduce time spent with friends like this, hope to end up in a positive working environment, and should probably just stop engaging in the subreddit I mentioned."
CPTSD,"I've completely lost my will to live and I'm hopeless, I can't get through this anymore.","I don't deserve to live

Nor do I want to.

I'm in a crisis mode and I don't know how to keep going anymore, or If I even could even If I tried my best.

My girlfriend dumped me (rightfully so) because I did something horrible and betrayed her trust and hurt her.

I don't want to feel sorry for myself, I don't deserve any pity.

I am a completely broken person beyond redemption. I'm too defective to keep living, I don't want to hurt anyone ever again, I don't want to be the cause of someone elses suffering.
But the fact is that I am, I hurt the woman I loved the most.
And I can never forgive myself for it.
She is the sweetest and most loving person I know.

My history is full of trauma, abandonment and mental illnessess.
Atleast before I believed that I was a good person, that has just been wronged and that I was a victim.
Still I wanted to be better, I wanted to be the safety and security for the person who needs it.

And now, I've Hurt and betrayed the one person who loved me.
I can never forgive myself for it, I will always regret what I did to her.

But none of it matters really, I can't undo my actions, I can't repair the damage that I did.

I've always felt that I don't belong in this world, and now I know it's true.

I should've died a long time ago, many times before. But for some reason I survived.
And I regret it.
I should've killed myself successfully long time ago.
At least then I could've died as a good person.
Now it's too late.

I've become everything I tried to be against.
Trauma made my life hell, I've tried my best to be a good person despite all of the things that happened to me.
And I've failed.
I hurt the person I've loved the most, person who trusted me and always cheered me up and supported me.

I'm completely lost and hopeless now, I want to die. I need to die. This world would be better off without me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have nothing left to give.
I don't care anymore at all.
I can't get up, not anymore.

I've tried all of the treatment methods and therapies, there is nothing left for me.
There is no help.

I am broken beyond repair.

It would be better If I just killed myself, at least then I wouldn't Hurt anyone ever again.

My past and trauma and all of the bad things that happened to me, I still clung on to hope that I could survive and things could get better.
Even when I didn't really believe in hope anymore, still I tried my best because I refused to believe that this is all life has to offer to me, that this is all I can do and get.

But now I know, it was true back then and now it's even more true. I can't justify hurting the person I loved the most, and the person who loved me despite all of my flaws.

I don't belong in this world, I should've died a long time ago.
I need to kill myself and remove myself from this world before I hurt anyone else.

I don't want anyone to suffer because of me ever again.

I am broken beyond repair, defective shell of a human. I have nothing left, nothing left to give."
CPTSD,Why villianizing weed irks me,"Weed is addictive. Weed is terrible for developing brains. Weed is not good for your heart/lungs/affected body part related to your form of intake. Weed is a drug that changes your mental state.

Sugar is addictive. Sugar is terrible for developing brains. Sugar is not good for your heart/lungs/affected body part related to your form of intake. Sugar is a drug that changes your mental state.

Caffeine is addictive. Caffeine is terrible for developing brains. Caffeine is not good for your heart/lungs/affected body part related to your form of intake. Caffeine is a drug that changes your mental state.

Weed is a medicine. And due to medicines and care being criminalized in our culture, we are left with few that we can self administer without the intervention of a medical provider. Some choose the provider route. I did not.

I chose weed, sugar, and caffeine as my medicinal addictions. Used to be nicotine too, but I've kicked it for now. I tend to cycle them. They do what they do for me, and I don't need to justify my relief to those not inside my skin.

Many people have many comments about the health of my body and frustration with my choices. 

They have a... moral idea. Of me. Because of my choices. 

And I really dont give a shit. The things I do bring no pain to others and I am doing these things as an adult with my full consent and understanding. 

I appreciate the few crumbs of genuine concern under the shit sandwich that is people's ""concern for addiction"" and ""but think of the children"" rhetoric. But I'll speak for most of the potheads here and say - We all pick our poisons. 

*You do too. Your dopamine rush from bullying cripples on the internet is a poison just as bitter as my cookie addiction, my friend.*

Be kind, and stay out of my body. Thanks.


Edit: Thank you, mods. That post.... it hurt a lot of us. We appreciate you stepping in. "
CPTSD,Divorce after 7years due to my CPTSD,"My condition (before diagnosis) had been used against me for the entire relationship to prove I should allow more abuse for years, until I broke.  After a full mental breakdown 2 years ago I knew my marriage was over. What occured was the worst beyrayal in my eyes. 
However,  I couldn't leave. I was bound by finances and was recovering from a major surgery, that my mother passed from previously. 
I woke up with no friends or family after years of disassociation. I felt like I was living someone else's life. The entire relationship they painted me as the abuser. Easy to do when they trigger you on purpose and you don't even know what's happening.  



I got into therapy and went hard for 2 years still ongoing. I got diagnosed with CPTSD and MDD. 
I have been a shadow and building myself for the first time. I feel like an infant learning to crawl. Now I have no idea where to go from here. I am so afraid of the future.  I have been told my whole relationship I'm too broken to do anything for myself. To the point of not even being able to leave my house alone, and then not at all. 

While I have been hitting my goals and gaining ground, I still live with this person. I still get emotionally abused, and triggered intentionally.  They still tell me how small I am and how I've never done anything. 

Even when I have proof I did these things, I still feel like it didn't happen. I lied like they said. My core keeps telling me of course that's not true. I go to my parts, and they don't trust me. I cry and try to do anything different but I am stuck. I am so frustrated that I can't get out. 

I am so angry at myself for thinking this person loved me. I'm so angry that I gave up so much of my life to them (I've known them for a very long time just not married). 

I feel like I had all this hope in love and life and put it all into one person and now that it didn't work I feel it won't ever work. 

I won't ever tell anyone else I how feel.or about my past. I won't ever be able to confide in someone and be comforted by my partner. I can't risk this again. 

I want it to stop so badly that it's triggered my intrusive ideation.  What if they're right? What if I have absolutely nothing to offer? What if what matters to me never matters to anyone else? 

Can I live alone without society? These thoughts prevent me from being able to actually plan my escape from the situation.  

I wish I had the strength to not be hurt by they're words. I wish so many things, but I can't get anywhere."
CPTSD,Hopelessly in love with a pathalogical liar,"2.5 years together and I only found out about his true nature, after he was unfaithful last month with 3 girls following a difficult series of fights about chores. Up until then, I was happy. Once I confronted him after having enough evidence, he opened up like a book about all his feelings, thoughts, childhood, everything I wish I had known before. He also confessed he is a pathological liar, although most things he has told me have been true. He feels like he has seperate lives. I feel so so betrayed. My heart aches for everything he has been through to get to this point. I only want him. He was it for me. My best friend. He says he feels so guilty he canâ€™t even handle seeing me again, that he has ruined his life and can never forgive himself for hurting the only person who was so good to him and he didnâ€™t know he could ever do this. He said he realized now he needs help but that he only wants to do it for me and not for himself. Iâ€™m so afraid of losing him. Iâ€™m also so afraid of losing myself. But I fear that both is already happening. I just want us to get help so bad."

CPTSD,Prazosin,So my doctor just up'd my prazosin to 5mg.  Ive been taking that dose for 2 nights.  I've been having dizzy spells when moving.  I'm wondering if anyone else experienced that when taking 5 mg. And is there something else that has helped you with nightmares.
CPTSD,The Trauma Memory Gate Has Opened,"Obligatory apologies for the long post. I was watching tik tok before bed and as I was winding down, I came across this motherfucker (hopefully linked below and Iâ€™m also sorry to anyone else it may trigger so watch at your own risk: itâ€™s ABOUT the â€œStill Face Motherhoodâ€ experiment but it doesnâ€™t show any of the experiment in the tik tok). It started the trauma memory gate openingâ€¦. Not a floodgate thankfully, but a trickle has begun. It was a really long night and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I slept a few hours but now Iâ€™m just here. Iâ€™m already a delayed processor as it is and the crying stopped last night for now. As the woman in the video started talking, and specifically mentioning the Still Face Motherhood experiment, my body already knew before I did. I started getting hot, the tears began at some point, and full sobbing by the end of the video. Iâ€™ve tried watching the â€œStill Faceâ€ experiment before and donâ€™t remember if I couldnâ€™t finish the video or if I just couldnâ€™t watch when the mom does the â€œStill Faceâ€. Either way, I watched it and a video about it right after and couldnâ€™t watch the mom do the â€œStill Faceâ€ either time. Even just thinking about it now makes me so viscerally uncomfortable. I wanna make it clear itâ€™s not just a neutral face sometimes, but a â€œStill Faceâ€ repeatedly when the child is trying to connect or get their needs met. The memories that started coming brought me to the realization that me and my brother were probably bullied by my family for being neurodivergent and my brother was just unable to mask his well enough. Me on the other hand masked so hard I burned out spectacularly at 20 and things only got worse from there with my family. When I say probably itâ€™s because Iâ€™ve had suspicions of my neurodivergence since starting therapy while my brother is more â€œobviouslyâ€ autistic. Like, itâ€™s a fucked up 50/50 of am I actually neurodivergent in some way or are my similar traits â€œjustâ€ from the trauma of being an unwanted child, especially only a little over a year younger than a child who needed more care. My brother, on the other hand, was diagnosed with just ADHD before autism was more understood as a kid and diagnosed both later in life. I asked my mom once if my brother knew heâ€™d been diagnosed with autism later and she justâ€¦ never responded. I now get to wonder if that silence was for me, too. I was so well trained to be passive that I just let her not respond and left the room. I owe my brother an apology for the rest of my lifetime at least. I fell in line and withdrew while he got the brunt of it. My oldest sister was always the worst bitch/bully about tearing us both down for literally any and all differences or mistakes. I was already worried she was traumatizing her kids thru the generational trauma my family already has but she does the â€œstill face,â€ to them, too. Itâ€™s such a weird place to be in because I know it wasnâ€™t done intentionally to traumatize meâ€¦ but at the same time I know Iâ€™ve been treated my whole life like Iâ€™m a nuisance and like theyâ€™re apathetic about my existence at BEST period. And by they I wanna make it clear I mean them all, especially my sister and mom, while my brother is excluded in that. Heâ€™s always been the better person, forever the best of us. Showing us all far more love than any of us deserves from him. I remember specifically learning that whatever behavior the family deemed as odd or bad should be treated with criticism at best and bullying at worst. Being the youngest, I couldnâ€™t figure out why my older brother didnâ€™t understand this dynamic and just mask harder or better like I did as if that was the correct response to abuse. If I owe my brother a lifetime apology, they owe him one for eternity. Only time they seemed to want me around is when Iâ€™d fulfill a role for them or in the family. Wanna know a â€œfunâ€ realization?? Iâ€™m doing a lot of therapy rn and have been curious why I sometimes/often exaggerate my facial expressionsâ€¦ in my head the emotional reason was always â€œI never want anyone to feel how Iâ€™ve felt.â€ I DIDNT KNOW HOW LITERAL THAT WAS UNTIL LAST NIGHT. I may call an extra therapy session weâ€™ll see. Take care of yourselves everyone. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT84XKJ6X/"
CPTSD,How to help my mother?,"My mother us depressed for tears and anxious.
She doesn't express feelings. He tone is very flat and she doesn't enjoy much things . She likes smoking.

I used to live with her and I was smoking then. 
There was trauma that happened to me when I was small and I think she blames herself.

Im in therapy, I moved to another country 5 years ago and I have PTSD, anxiety and depression but I fight it.

My mother doesn't do anything.
I tried my best and I am unable to help. Often it feels like only I make her happy.
I urged her to get therapy, or family therapy online but she procrastinates all the time.

I talked to her on phone now and she us just so emotionless, I feel guilt for telling her what to do, I'm burdened that sge can't take care if herself, I'm sad because her depression affects me. I was just hitting my head because I can't stand to talk to her because I am very empathic and its destroying me.

Help me:ðŸ˜­"
CPTSD,I literally canâ€™t remember anything and itâ€™s ruining my life,"Iâ€™m 27 and I can barely recall any events in my life. I barely remember anything from my childhood except the bad things or sprinkles of random images that pop up in my head. I canâ€™t remember things about myself either. If someone asks me randomly whats my favorite snack or movie, my mind will literally go blank. This has also discouraged me to go on dates or meet new people because if they ask me questions about myself I literally canâ€™t remember which makes me look idiotic. 

To make matters worse I also have ADHD which also contributes to my poor working memory. But everyone else I know with adhd are still able to have flowing conversations and tell stories. My brothers grew up in the same household as me and they always recall all our childhood which confuses me because why did I get the memory issues related to trauma and not them? 

I have issues remembering what happens in Anime, books, YouTube videos, etc. Itâ€™s been hell for me especially socially. I canâ€™t remember anything I did or anything good I can bring up in conversations so my conversations with people can be very surface level. 

I may be wrong but I feel like it impacts my self development journey as well. If i do research on topics like goal setting or self confidence and I canâ€™t remember what i learned then how am i going to apply it to my life? 

I was thinking about writing notes and making flashcards of thing i want to remember. Correct me if im wrong but if im having issues remembering things, then i have to do the extra work to store things into my long term memory through active recall or regularly reviewing notes about my life. Obviously the goal is to go to therapy to adress my trauma in depth but itâ€™s not something i can afford right now.

Please share your advice and coping strategies for this issues, thank you!"
CPTSD,Hypervigilance? Intuition? Idkkkk,"Really struggling to trust my thoughts and emotions. I notice because I can be sensitive to things, itâ€™s really hard to tell if people are intentionally being harmful and manipulative towards me. When I ask for clarity I am told â€˜no I donâ€™t think thatâ€™ even when the personâ€™s behaviour is telling me otherwise. Then when I try to rationalise what about their behaviour made me feel off, I come up with nothing or I find myself mentally defending the person. I am left confused or exhausted if I then dig deeper to reflect. Itâ€™s an endless loop but how do you internally know the difference between real harm and hypervigilance/sensitivity to harm?

What is this and do you experience anything similar?"
CPTSD,Please help me,"Have anyone watched glee? Recently, I googled glee nail and nothing came up except articles about marks chargers and conviction. May someone please google glee bail? In order, to prove to me that I did nothing wrong so I can assure my brain that everything is ok"
CPTSD,Mom committed suicide,"I didn't realize until recently how much this triggered my abandonment issues. My mom was a truck driver, and when I was 27 she committed suicide. She was horribly abusive growing up, and we were working on repairing our relationship when she passed as she had found religion and truly wanted to rectify things. 

I'm sooooo angry with her. It had me stay in a marriage that wasn't right for me until my wife left and my abandonment issues have made me codependent and sabotaging of all my friendships and friends. 

I hate it so much. I hate her so much."
CPTSD,My success is not a compensation.,"I hate when people say 'but whatever that happened to you made you what who you are today. '

I have herd this statement more than once and yes said by therapist too. I don't hate myself anymore, not to the level i used to. But this statement sucks to n number of level. 

What I'm today, or when i was in better place socially, is not a compensation of whatever wrong that happened towards me. I hate these people and one of them is my good friend i talk less to him i don't share as much i used to. I have distance myself and showed them through my actions. But it still sucks that whatever i become specially if i become good and successful it suddenly becomes a compensation of whatever wrong that happened to me.

The beating i get as a child becomes lesson amd SA becomes something that helps me with my personality? Why because I'm people pleaser, 'the good people of society'? Or just because i have empathy? I have been through pain tons of pain, my childhood, my teenage, my adulthood. I haven't breath enough yet my achievements becomes compensation."
CPTSD,Persistant feelings of Unsafety,"How do I function at all with such severe anxiety?  It just keeps getting worse. I'm taking my anti-anxiety meds way more frequently but it's not really helping anymore and I'm basically not functioning at all. I hate how incapable I feel of helping myself. Every doctors visit seems to make things worse, hell every time I leave the house things seem to get worse, more reasons to fear people, more interpersonal trauma, more flashbacks and panic attacks, and I just wanted help. 

That's the thing I've done wrong this whole time. I had the audacity to ask for help in a society obsessed with stepping on each other."
CPTSD,The issue with finding people to connect with whilst healing,"Does anyone else find that it's difficult finding the people to support you through healing because the people who understand and have their own trauma don't have a lot of capacity and then the people who are more available tend to be detached from their feelings so it's hard to feel connected to them. I feel it's like you want to find someone who is further on in their recovery, who can sit with pain, who understand but also has some capacity to give. And I guess that's kind of what a good therapist is meant to do, but I find I'm looking for someone to relate to, someone who can share their own story and relate, empathise at the hard parts, laugh at funny bits, hold you when you need comfort, validate you. I think there is a big bit missing in typical therapy that the therapist does not share themselves and all these professional boundaries are in place, which limit love and connection which are elixirs.

 At the moment I don't really have anyone in my life who is in touch with their feelings and is doing the work of healing. I have those I can talk and relate to about the struggles but they haven't yet started doing the work of soothing and releasing their pain and they tend to want to stay home a lot and they tend to be very tired and it's hard to find many opportunities to socialise with them. I also have low energy a lot of days whilst doing healing work but there are days when I do want to socialise. Then I have people in my life who are always up for doing stuff but I feel disconnected being around them whilst healing as they are unable to be in touch with their own sadness or pain and so I can only be around them when those aren't my predominate feelings. Otherwise when I do bring up my sadness and pain it tends to feel kinda awkward or they mean well but tend to say invalidating things, like trying to show why I don't need to be sad.

And this is the big thing I've realised is that whilst you uncover all this stuff about yourself, all these things get uncovered about the people in your life. So as I get more comfortable exploring and expressing my sadness, I've learnt what the people in my life's relationship is to sadness. Or to vulnerability, intimacy, fear, anger.

And so when I express when I feel invalidated to them I realise it's actually a huge topic, because it's not just how the person is being with you in the moment, it's how they are operating in life. In general if they can't sit with your pain, they cannot sit with their pain and the avoidance of their pain is what is allowing them to continue in life. It's helped me feel more compassionate to these people who won't get in touch with their feelings (and meaning I end up feeling invalidated and disconnected to them - feeling like an abandonment/rejection) as when I finally lifted the lid of that pandora's box of my pain, I wasn't able to work anymore.

So it's like I desperately wanted them to join me in being in touch with our feelings but it's also rough as hell right now, so when I look at what it is that I'm actually asking them to be able to do, it's a huge thing. I'm so glad to be doing healing work, I wouldn't go back to where I was before, but I do wish for company being out here. Most of the time I am content with my own company, genuinely not feeling lonely being alone for the first time in my life. But sometimes I ache to connect with someone whilst going through this."
CPTSD,"Kintsugi - The Japanese Art (and philosophy) of repairing pottery with precious metals ""Breakage is part of the history of an object rather than something to disguise.""","If you are unfamiliar with the art of Kintsugi it's worth a gander.  The premise is that lovely teacups are deliberately broken and then repaired with a lacquer with precious metals mixed in - each cup is unique and the repair shows the history of the object.  It teaches to embrace these flaws as part of the history of an object.  Once repaired, it is useable and functional again.  

I find this to be a wonderful metaphor for those of us working our best to heal from our CPTSD.

CPTSD,were you given the silent treatment ?,"I grew up thinking it was normal and common for a very long time. But then as an adult I started remembering, and it just feels like such a cruel thing to do to young kids. 

My parent would be triggered by something we did (definitely they shouldâ€™ve never had kids lol), something thatâ€™s normal for kids to do like slight misbehaving or playing too loud or whatever. 
My parent would go for days without talking to us. When they were in the same room as us or passed by us in a hallway, they wouldnâ€™t look us in the eye. If we looked at them and apologized or tried to start a lighthearted conversation to get the parent to acknowledge us, they would look straight past us like we werenâ€™t there. If we kept speaking, they would say â€œDo you hear something? Thatâ€™s weird I thought I heard somethingâ€ and would just continue doing what they were doing, without looking or acknowledging us. 

What do you think about it?? How traumatic is it? Have you experienced it?"
CPTSD,"Trigger warning for everything, some of it will probably be tmi and im so sorry im terrified and disturbed","I've already known that I have CPTSD, so that part is no secret. I've made a few posts here about repressed memories and recovering those and my reasoning as to why I believe I have repressed memories to begin with, which has only gotten deeper.

I happen to have seizures and am on anticonvulsants and I know there are several papers on epileptic seizures basically rewiring parts of your brain and bringing back repressed memories. I have a paper on seizures bringing back vivid recollections of traumatic memories, which has happened before. The month of December was pretty rough personally and with my partner and I ended up having a ton of seizures that generalized and I'm pretty sure that's what sent me into the worst PTSD relapse I've ever had that's still going. The beginning of the month started off with a bunch of nightmares fir a few weeks, then we had all the personal problems for a few weeks, then the rest of the month was just hell.

I realized upon further thought that I do hallucinate to a lesser degree (such as thinking someone is walking up behind me), but the only other time I've hallucinated to this extent was temporarily after a suicide attempt when I overdosed. It wasn't constant, but just enough to unsettle me.

It started off with me seeing a shadowy figure on my porch that I knew wasn't real. Now I feel like I'm always seeing or hearing things that aren't there, like those figures, I looked back in a vent post I had made elsewhere and apparently I had an olfactory hallucination before, I've had auditory ones where I think people are calling my name, specifically I'll think I'm hearing my abuser's voice. I've been having flashbacks to hell that I can, in fact, verify happened, but I'll dissociate during the flashback and shut down and go nonverbal because I'm either too disturbed by the content or afraid I'll be judged, so unless I write down what the flashback is, I will forget what the recollection was, which is also what happened before when I mentioned I've had recollections from seizures. However, I've also been having my first tactile hallucinations (sexual in nature and massive trigger warning if you don't want to know what it was) >!where I felt an erect penis being violently rubbed and twisted all over my arm while I was just minding my business scrolling on my phone!< that I cannot verify the existence of so I can't really say whether or not it was a flashback or not, even though I dissociated in the same exact way as I would a flashback. I also had another, particularly disturbing experience yesterday that I'm not sure was a delusion, a hallucination, or an intrusive thought that I just grabbed and thought was real >!where my husband was trying to initiate sex and began to use a vibrator, and the nerve pain I experience, coupled with the vibration and the feeling of my skin sticking to it made me think he was using a saw blade to cut off my clitoris. On one hand, I knew the thought was irrational and he didn't have a saw blade in his hand, but on the other hand, I couldn't shake the thought and began to panic and dissociate, again, in the same way.!< I again cannot verify that anything of this sort has ever happened to me, so I can't say it was a flashback, however, if it turns out to be real, it would definitely explain a whole lot of things, including even some of the self harm urges I would get.

Honestly, I'm just terrified, especially with the sexual stuff invading my wakefulness now, because it was just restricted to specific types of nightmares >!(I would exclusively get nightmares about being raped, sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked, however I don't really have any suspicions about being trafficked, which is why I'm wondering why I even have those nightmares and now these delusions or whatever they are)!<. I feel like I'm crazy, especially because I'm starting to straight up hallucinate now and everything is just bad. My abuser also has delusions that are uncontrolled and will use them to stalk me and cause harm and I am scared that I am turning into my abuser, but with the mental illness part, not necessarily by collecting toxic behaviors, but because of a mental illness. Everything about a CPTSD relapse is terrifying for me, but now since we're adding more jazz to it, I don't know if it's just plain CPTSD anymore and it's scary and it adds stigma and it makes me want to hide or eliminate myself and I'm scared I'm just going to get worse or become toxic or abusive or my abuser. I can't trust my brain anymore because I know it's playing tricks on me every day, whether it's the epilepsy or the alice in wonderland syndrome or maybe a migraine aura or a good ol mental health episode that you pull out of a hat because I never know what I'm going to get at this point. 

I noticed that it seems like I'll hallucinate or have a flashback or something within a few hours of having a generalized seizure, which is why I'm pretty positive it's connected to them, and I don't think my meds are doing a good job controlling them since I'm on the lowest dosage and my neuro is more intent to cross me off his patient list instead of putting in the time to adjust my meds and such. This could also be a side effect to the meds, or maybe it could be repressed memories trying to surface, and if that's actually what this is, I'm fucking terrified to know the rest, because I know a child wasn't designed to handle the stress of whatever that was happening, but if that's real, neither is an adult. No normal adult could just deal with that shit, and to be honest, any of the abuse in general that we've had to put up with as kids or whatever."
CPTSD,"[Trigger Warning] Suspected CSA, fear of sexual intimacy, and how to keep on living.","I severely suspect I experienced some sort of child sexual abuse at a very young age, I estimate it to be around 3-4 years old. However I have no memories of anything happening, in fact I have a huge memory gap during that age specifically. 

My main symptoms began showing at around 4-5 years old. Any mention, or image of anything related to the human body from the inside (be it a video of a cell flowing through blood, for example, or a close up of the inside of the human stomach, etc.) suscitated a reaction in me which I can only explain as panic, chills, and fear (more specifically, any representation of something entering the human body made me feel this way). When I had my first sex ed. class at 11 I began reacting the same way when hearing about the topic, which I then discovered that to be my trigger. 

I also remember isolating a lot at the age of 4, I wouldn't enter the classroom and sit in silence in the floor for hours, multiple times.

Any explicit talk about sex, or porn itself, caused the same reaction in me, so I kind of suppressed anything sex related for most of my teenage years. However, being a handsome young male I couldn't pretend forever, and eventually ended up in multiple situations where sex was involved.

I didn't enjoy them, felt kind of numb and could never get to penetrating properly. 

Eventually, I got really close with someone and we both liked each other, until one day we ended in the same bed together and she got on top of me very suddenly and wanted to have sex. Something flicked in my brain, kind of triggered a fight or flight response and immediatelly began crying rivers, out of nowhere. She held me in her arms while I curled up and cried. She really cared about me, and that was a very beautiful moment, despite it all.

That relationship never got anywhere. I don't feel safe with people touching me if I don't trust them 100%. Any relationship I've tried to have ends up in nothing because of my refusal to have sex right away. It feels like no one wants to take that burden.

To anyone in a similar situation, what have you done to be able to carry on, and live life? Have you found any partner willing to take up that responsibility and be patient?"
CPTSD,Every time I feel bad I say this to my inner bully.,"Recently saw a post that said â€œYou should train your inner negative self talkâ€ like you train a dog. After seeing that, I started to call it out loud in my brain. Whenever I catch a negative toxic self-talk, I tell â€œShut up and sit down you bully! You are a remorseless cruel dog!â€ I am doing it for just 4-5 days and I feel like I can breather again. 

Sincerely, I donâ€™t want to have negative self talk, I am not and never been a bully, Iâ€™ve been bullied a lot by my parents and terrible people at middle school, so I promised that to myself. Even itâ€˜s against me, I am not the person who talks anyone in this tone. 

I hope it helps to someone."
CPTSD,Triggered. Looking for support and kind words,"*TW: mention of self-harm, suicidal thoughts*

I just got back from a high school friendâ€™s engagement party. I am triggered, in pain, experiencing emotional flashbacks and canâ€™t figure out how to make it all stop ðŸ˜­

I grew up queer in a conservative society and never got to experience dating or relationships as a teenager. I was always the single one, always without a partner, always being the odd one out. And I made me feel like shit. There was this overhwelming feeling of rejection, like no one wants me, like I donâ€™t deserve love or partnership.

I did manage to start dating in my mid 20s but havenâ€™t been able to find a stable long-term relationship in the past 10 years or so. Itâ€™s been a mix of casual hookups, or being cheated on by a partner, or being in a toxic relationship, or else being someoneâ€™s â€œbackup optionâ€ and getting dumped as soon as they found someone better.

It all makes me feel lilke a piece of shit. I start thinking â€œWhy else would I be the only single one when everyone else manages to find a partner? There must be something wrong with me.â€ And these thoughts come with this pain which is a mix of rejection, my own inadequacy and a sense that â€œno one wants meâ€. Rationally, I know that this is not true but itâ€™s impossible to believe anything else!

The worst part is that I used to feel all this very intensely when I was around 17-19, to the extent that I was seriously contemplating suicide. Although I ended up not attempting, being triggered to that time brings back those suicidal thoughts and even thoughts of self-harm. Thankfully, I canâ€™t find any sharp objects around me, so it looks like I wonâ€™t be self-harming too seriously (beyond maybe scratching myself or something).

Iâ€™m tired of fighting these thoughts and all the negative emotions. I just want this pain and mental chaos to stop ðŸ˜ž

CPTSD,DO NOT GO WATCH POOR THINGS IF YOU SUFFER FROM CPTSD INVOLVING CSA,"Spoilers: 

In the movie, the main female character has the brain of a child. A literal child. The film shows her exploring her body while not understanding the world and being able to speak in full sentences and it only gets worse from there. They make her ""develop"" at a faster rate but by the time she becomes a prostitute (yes that happens) she still acts/speaks like a child. SHe also ends up having sex in front of children. I was so disgusted I left the theater to try and calm down so I don't know how worse it got, but it was incredibly triggering and disgusting. "
CPTSD,"Overuse/abuse of the term ""Triggered""?","Do you - like me - get triggered by the excessive use of the term ""triggered"". I'm kinda joking on the word here but, really, does it bother everyone else as much as it does me? Same as people saying things like ""OMG, I so ADHD/OCD!"" Or saying they were ""traumatized"" by something minor?

I have two kids, age 12 & 8 (who are both on the internet, and probably here it all the time), and I explained to them that it is a scientific term in relation to a specific condition - and really shouldn't be used outside of it, as it diminishes the actual meaning. And this is detrimental to other people's understanding of just how serious and troubling it is to have real triggers.

I do believe most people have trauma, probably multiple, and thus in could be an actual trigger for some people, so I don't wanna jump to conclusions. It's just that it gets used for a minor irritation way too often, it seems."

I got engaged to my love in October, iâ€™m employed, I have friends who care about me, iâ€™m relatively healthy, i have a dog that i love, and a nice place to live. i can take care of myself and meet my basic needs, and then some. i have come a long way from the emotionally abusive home that i knew and am working hard on LC/NC. 

I started EMDR therapy at the end of September and am so happy with my therapist. She is the best iâ€™ve ever had and i feel very safe with her. we are still working on the reprocessing memory portion of EMDR and havenâ€™t necessarily gotten to the stage of EMDR where you bring out the big guns and it starts to â€œworkâ€, which is when everyone begins to rave about its effects. 

since we are at the reprocessing stage, i feel like iâ€™ve been spiraling down a deep depression hole, which i guess is to be expected when you are rehashing old painful memories that you have repressed for years. i just didnâ€™t really expect for these memories to be bleeding into my current experiences and my current reality, and iâ€™m having somewhat of a difficult time distinguishing between the two. has anyone else experienced this with EMDR or in general? i feel so overwhelmed every day and canâ€™t stop crying, i just feel very lost and confused. 

a major disruptive family event happened a couple months ago that has been new-ish and there are new wounds, that also have brought up the old ones. then, last month i got COVID for the first time and fell into an even deeper depression and isolation. and now im worried that i canâ€™t pull myself out of it and am losing my sense of self. i have been more irritable and â€œsplittingâ€ (i havenâ€™t been diagnosed with bpd but i recognize this symptom in myself) and yeah itâ€™s a lot. 

i just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this at the beginning of EMDR because i want to hear your experiences. my SO is extremely concerned but understanding, and i just feel so much shame (what im trying NOT to feel) for putting them through my bullshit. thanks everyone <3"
CPTSD,Dae have texts you want to post here or somewhere else but you never do in the end?,"First brain fog is always in the way, then it doesn't feel worth it, then when I finally post I want to delete them.

CPTSD,"Alone, lost and scared","Hi, 

I just wanted to share what Iâ€™m going through tonight and in general as I donâ€™t know what else to do and I am currently very anxious. Iâ€™m 30, I am the only sibling out of 4 to still live with parents. Still at 30 when my parents fight I freeze, I was standing completely still for 2 hours listening in case I need to jump in as some times it gets physical and my dad is a lot stronger then my mum. Nothing physical happened in the end, but at some point it felt like it was so angry he wanted to lash out on her. 

I know this is somehow linked to why my life has been challenging so far and Iâ€™ve really struggled with relationships, anxiety,  depression, careers, health, wealth, you name it. Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to be more accountable in accepting it is half my fault for not being resilient enough and things have been somewhat trending upward the last few weeks and Iâ€™m really scared this is going to derail me again.

They have lots of silly fights, small bickering or ignore each other frequently. but today was a level 3 out of 5 event (events  is just at a way for me to define how it differs from everyday stuff or outside the realm of normal in this house). 
The first event I ever remember witnessing was when I was 5-7 maybe, I remember hearing the commotion from the kitchen and my older siblings trying to distract us until at some point we all ended up in the kitchen because it must have gotten really bad. I have a very vivid memory in my head of me and my 3 siblings standing in the kitchen all mortified and crying, with my dad siting on my mum with her hands pinned and blood on her face. The only other thing I  remember that night was that shortly after, my motherâ€™s parents came, and then police as well. I also remember my dad apologising and being very sorry when the police were around. (That would be level 5 event)

There were multiple level 3-4 that I canâ€™t quite remember or define individually over the years. 
Iâ€™d say there have been 5 level 5 events over the years. Police called multiple times. On multiple occasions as early as 15 I have had to jump in between them sometimes when punches or slaps were thrown. On 1 occasion after seeing my dad hit mum as hard as he could 2-3 times with a yellow pages I remember him pursuing us in car pursuit, my sisters was driving and I remember him screaming at us through the window whenever he got close. 
A few years ago I remember him getting drunk and had a massive fight, I guess he wanted to escape or leave his life/situation, he stripped all his clothes off and walked down our street in a fit of rage, luckily I was able to get him back inside quickly. 
Sometimes I have to comfort him when heâ€™s emotional and drunk after a fight, itâ€™s really difficult to comfort someone youâ€™re also afraid of.

My father is mentally unwell, and I know a few reasons why. Although he is the scary one to see angry, my mother is not all innocent. Sheâ€™s isnâ€™t perfect, or the most mentally balanced person either. But in terms of the actually arguments, she is probably equally as childish as him sometimes. 

I was quite depressed over the last few years, itâ€™s a vicious cycle going in and out of depression, sometimes it lasts days, sometimes a few weeks. 

Im terrified that this will always affect me, I feel I canâ€™t leave my mother alone with my father knowing how he can react over something so small and silly (obviously in his mind itâ€™s rather large with a complex mean, but itâ€™s very irrational and when he canâ€™t control things he gets angry). Apart of me feels like I should completely disconnect from my parents and maybe even my siblings, for a real fresh start. because it really breaks me to know they will never truly be happy. It makes me sad to see how much of a broken and twisted man my father is, and my mother is not perfect but sheâ€™s very kind. Although they are fighting about something different it always has the same themes, as if they have had the same fight for 38 years a some small thing flares it up.

I feel as though my anxious thoughts are always here, right now they are loud and very apparent. But I feel like they are always with me lingering in the back of my head. Not know when the next event will occur or how bad itâ€™s going to be. Sometimes I hear things, on one occasion maybe a year ago I recall standing dead still in my room for an hour not knowing if or what my parents were fighting about. They werenâ€™t even fighting and I think the neighbours were having a party or something. 

This felt good to write down, but even now that Iâ€™ve finished  my head is slowly drifting back into hyper awareness, any subtle sound of the dead night is mistaken for whispering or fighting. Every creek in my house could be my dad getting out of bed to fight some more. I canâ€™t move. 

I apologies for my post being so jumbled and non linear. I really just wanted to write down what Iâ€™m feeling or thinking in the moment."
CPTSD,I hate how broken my perception of men is,"I get immediately attached to anyone who shows me a little bit of attention. I get butterflies in my stomach if a man smiles at me. I subconsciously keep track of how many guys check me out in the streets when I'm walking by 

I can only ever see a man be sexually interested in me. I don't believe genuine love is a possibility for me. There's plenty of reasons for this too but you can already imagine what they are 


I'm constantly and I mean *constantly* fantasizing about some sexual scenarios or even just being hugged, kissed, or told ""I love you"" 

I hate myself for this. I've turned men, literal human beings with a different chromosome than me, to some objects that carry meaning only to my soul wounds 


If I wasn't a girl I'd be declared an incel. I realize just how much wrong this is but my mind keeps craving living in this fantasy world 


I need help but I don't even know what to do about it. And getting therapy isn't an option due to my current circumstances"
CPTSD,almost 20 and still afraid of adults,"i turn 20 this year and my inferiority complex and fear of people older than me hasn't left. in unsound mind i fear adults who are older and smarter, i feel anxious in their presence, i feel stupid and ignorant and small.

i grew up fearing strangers, teenagers, adults, anyone in position of power of me, anyone who could control me. i both want to fawn and please them and run away in terror. to shun them as i feel shunned. it won't go away i don't know how to cope with it. i only feel somewhat safe around maternal woman at my work which is a double edged sword considering i was abused by both men and women. 

i got triggered because i brought up a creative concept over a dnd campaign in the presence of an adult (who runs the campaign) who shut it down immediately. this adult is often dismissive or takes things very literally and seriously. this triggers me but i try to control it because they are a mutual friend. logical side of me thinks it's no big deal, it was just an idea i probably wouldn't have gone through with anyway, and they are the DM so it makes sense. irrational side of me got angry, wanted to be self-destructive, felt dissociative and distractible at work. if they were the same age as me i think i wouldn't have been so intimidated, but they are 5 almost 6 years older than me. i felt hurt and dejected.

how do i deal with this? how do i overcome my inferiority complex? i just want to be normal"
CPTSD,Hypervigilance related to my partner,"Hi guys,

I've been in  therapy for around 2 years now.

I don't want to enter in a lot of detail but my trauma is mainly related to my ex partner and porn. He treated me like shit and disregarded lots of my boundaries. Apart from this I have always felt not enough due to my childhood.

These all leads to the present where my hypervigilance activates when my partner is in another room for a ""long"" period of time. My fear is that be is going to masturbate/watch porn.

I don't like the idea of porn but I completely understand that masturbation is healthy and good for him and the relationship. I have nothing against it. I know all the theory but I cannot help but feeling like shit every time he goes to the bathroom for a long time or when he is playing in another room.

I've done EMDR, parts therapy etc I've tried deep breathing to calm myself. The only thing that helps more is wearing my noise cancelling headphones in the situations. I've realised that I'm mostly scared of hearing him doing something. If I'm in silence I'm way better.

When he goes to the bathroom I cannot help but getting hypervigilant, trying to hear everything, nit being able to focus on anything else. My heart goes fast.

My therapist says that that's a way of ""running away"" from the situation and I get it... She told me about maybe telling him to do it on purpose while I'm in another room so my body understands nothing happens. Understand that I'm safe and I have the tools to overcome it.

I know I won't die but at the same time I feel like even like that I would still feel like shit. I know it's a long process but I'm so tired...

Im so tired of not feeling safe in my own house, of thinking about this fucking trauma every day, several times.

He went for holidays this Christmas and I was dreading him to return home because of this. Poor thing, I feel so bad for feeling that but I understand that my body just needed a break.

I love him and I know this has nothing to do with him but I'm so tired... I would give all my money for a normal life.

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit. Any advice is welcome."
CPTSD,Is it really true you can resolve dissociative amnesia? Feeling so dragged down by the filter and fog it puts over my life. Itâ€™s like the lights and volume in my life are too low.,"I have read articles about how dissociative amnesia isnâ€™t permanent, that itâ€™s treatable, but I havenâ€™t seen any sort of testimonials or studies following these patients. It seems unbelievable at times. Maybe I need to dig in more. I was curious about any experiences navigating this condition and the disconnected nature because of CPTSD

I have had a sort of fog following me around starting from a blacked out period between the ages of 7 and 8. Iâ€™ve been out of it and inattentive ever since. I struggle forming memories, recalling memories, and feeling sort of â€œspace-yâ€ most of my life.  Recognizing myself in the mirror is challenging and I canâ€™t be present with my loved ones. It has created a distance between myself and others I donâ€™t know how to close. 

I honestly see no true hope of achieving relief from this condition. My therapist has said that I can have a fulfilling life once I install safety and consistency in my life that will be enough to support the processing of trauma. Itâ€™s so hard to imagine a life that isnâ€™t plagued by this disconnection from myself and others. I wish I had a life that had the richness that comes from being fully immersed and present. 

Yes, I am working on the skills and trying my best to make sure that I can feel safe. But there is a part of me that is fighting back hard. I canâ€™t shake that itâ€™ll never really go away and thatâ€™s tough. 


Any resources you all have on these feelings and experiences would be helpful.  I feel so alone."
CPTSD,What to do if really emotionally destabilised?,"Hi there,
I struggle with dissociation, but not sure if it is DID. I recently did 12 sessions of EMDR over the span of 3 months, and I am incredibly destabilised. I constantly get flashbacks to this one particular traumatic event, and cannot do any type of work or relax and enjoy myself. All I can do is sit on Tiktok and hope to distract myself. I am unable to ground myself, I tried a technique such as focusing on my breath and focusing on my feet on the ground, but because I have ADHD I really struggle to focus. My go to mechanism of dealing with it is daydreaming, which is how I got through it at a child, but I want to stop that now. Any advice?"
CPTSD,Christmas ended. Letâ€™s begin again.,"I finally ended my Christmas vacation in the home where most of the abuse happened, having to eat alongside my abuser (it's complicated, as many of you know).

I just want to send a message of support to anyone reading this. I know it's a clichÃ© to say that a new year is a full array of opportunities to grow and heal. I am the kind of depressed person who can only see the darkness. But we must fight it.

It's not much, probably nothing. But I trust, at least let me try to dream today, that we can do it. We deserve it.

CPTSD,"I hate life so much, I can't do it anymore","I guess my abusive childhood has led me down a path of becoming a people pleaser.  Most of my interactions I try to talk about what the other person wants to and try to be a positive part of their life.  But no one wants me.  No one appreciates me, no one cares about me.  I want to die I hate how I had a terrible childhood and now all the healthy adults would rather hang with each other than be friends with me just because I'm awkward and uninteresting.  I want to die soon.  I hate living I hate life I can't do this anymore.  It's not worth anything to me"
CPTSD,I feel like there is nothing left of me,"I donâ€˜t even know who I am, who I was. There is nothing left in me. Iâ€˜ve been feeling so bad for so long, I am almost in tears thinking about what I could do to feel better atm, but I just donâ€˜t know. I just want it to stop. 
I have been abused for almost all my life, first my parents, then my ex. I got into foster care when I was 13, the abuse did not stop. I have been alone ever since, no one is here anymore. 
If only one person had seen me, cared for me, maybe I wouldnâ€˜t be so lost. There had been so many opportunities to help me when I was younger, no one even tried.
I am in my twenties now, it has been years since I have talked about anything that is really going on with me. I was in therapy, but he, too, just made it about him, I stopped going when he made awful comments about me trying to tell him how suicidal I was. 
I hardly have friends left, but neither do I talk to them about my life nor do I have the energy for socializing, I donâ€˜t feel like I can ever enjoy anything anymore, all I feel is hate and fear. 
I hate myself so much I can not even leave my flat. I am so afraid that I canâ€˜t even think about my past. I need help so badly, but no one will ever come. I tried to find a therapist specialized in trauma, contacted a centre in my city, went to an appointment but was declined because I have private insurance and it would be easier for me to find something else than it would be for others. This has just not been true for me. 
In addition I have gotten ill in June, I hardly manage by myself, had to stop studying, I am in pain and once again, no doctor helps. 
Almost everything that could have gone wrong in my life, did go wrong and I donâ€˜t just feel this way because I am depressed. I have done everything I could, tried to ditch those who hurt me, finished school against all odds, have my own appartment, but I feel like my life is over. It hasnâ€˜t even begun and I can not bear it anymore. 

I donâ€˜t know why I wrote this, I have several drafts from trying to post here, I just feel like I will explode soon if I donâ€˜t let some things out. This sub is the only validation I get from time to time, I am so sorry for all of us and I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for reading"
CPTSD,Is my fetish trauma related?,"
Hello,

 I'm seeking insights regarding a potential trauma-linked issue. In kindergarten, I witnessed an incident where an overweight teacher sat on a child, an event that seems to have shaped my sexual development. This led to a fetish about being physically overpowered by larger individuals, further intensified by a pornography addiction and a shift towards content involving male individuals. I've actively engaged in behaviors and fantasies tied to this fetish, causing significant distress. I'm concerned this might be trauma-induced. Can this be linked to that early experience, and is it possible for me to have a normal, healthy relationship despite this? I would appreciate guidance on how to understand and address these issues."

CPTSD,How to reconcile inherent human mind fallibility with self-trust?,"Perhaps more of a philosophical questions, but it becomes ever more nagging.

How to retain self trust, even though our minds are loaded with cognitive biases, possible false memories and beliefs which might not be aligned with reality? And ""going with the flow"" by following our emotions might end up with detrimental results? 

At the same time - critically investigating these biases leads to a fear of perhaps minimizing your experience or self-gaslighting.

A bit of a limbo/no-win situation, don't you think?"
CPTSD,I canâ€™t travel due to my cptsd,"Iâ€™m 27f and been overseas once and Iâ€™m tired of people telling me I need to travel more.

I grew up abused in a very violent, poor, unstable home and moved out very young to escape. I feel like itâ€™s moulded my brain to look for safety and jetting off as a solo woman traveller is the furthest thing from that. I canâ€™t cope with change and donâ€™t like long commutes or not sleeping in my own bed. My aunt has visited almost every country and she canâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t pick up and leave other than I canâ€™t afford it.

Itâ€™s really scary and discouraging knowing that this is something Iâ€™m gonna have to deal with for the rest of my life.  Everything triggers me and makes me relapse.  Iâ€™m sick and tired of all them useless meds Iâ€™m taking.  Iâ€™m tired of seeing psychiatrists, Therapists and psychologists and having to waste all this money on nothing.  I feel trapped in my life although Iâ€™ve made some drastic changes lately.  Iâ€™m full of shame and guilt.  I resent a lot of people.  My confidence has been shattered mostly because of these meds Iâ€™ve been taking all them years.

I have nobody who understands how I feel, not even my own Mother. I hate myself so unbearably, my face, my body, my attitude and anger issues. I canâ€™t be good no matter what I do.

CPTSD,I learned it was worse than I thought (Vent),"I have memories of being SAâ€™d by a father figure as a child for sure once, another time is a hazy memory that might be wrong, and the last was a clear memory of him deciding against it at the last moment. He stopped as I got older and I guess somehow this lead to me still having a parent/child relationship with him. 

Lately, I was discussing TMI things with a friend of mine, and she was telling me that her relative who was SAâ€™d as a child as well (Iâ€™m not sure how explicit Iâ€™m allowed to be so Iâ€™ll be vague) had a certain odd thing she would do that was a sign of CSA. I was horrified because I also did this thing from a much younger age than my first SA memory. 

So yeah, I donâ€™t know why, I knew I was SAâ€™d a few times, but the fact that there are times that I donâ€™t remember donâ€™t sit well with me. Like I canâ€™t cope with being touched and not remembering it, I donâ€™t know how to. Itâ€™s been nagging at my brain since my friend and I discussed it. I feel gross. At least before, I thought I remembered all the bad from my childhood, but now Iâ€™m realizing the holes in my memory. 

I donâ€™t know. I just needed to vent, itâ€™s messing me up pretty badly. Iâ€™d prefer not to discuss my current relationship with my abuser, as he is still considered one of my parents.

CPTSD,Am i who i am because of what i experienced?,"Has the pain Iâ€™ve experienced my entire life shaped me into who i am?

Do i know who i am without it? 
Im afraid if i let it go, if i forget the trauma ive been through, if the scars fade that iâ€™ll forget who i am.

I feel like 3 different people over my life, the naive carefree happy kid, the despicable creature who existed through 8-14, then limbo, then what i am.
These three people feel so far apart from each other, it splits how i feel sometimes.
Idk was just in a dissociative spiral and i had a moment of clarity where i wanted to cut off who i am from this body, from those two other wretches, and float away into a kinder, more caring universe.

Memories of my childhood are more faded and murky and i cant remember anything, but distorted versions of traumatic memories.

I feel like whatever i am, rn, emerged from that muddy swamp and is still dragged and held down by those remnants that dont wanna let go. This fleeing creature doesnt know what it is and its afraid that itâ€™ll forget about its own existence if it manages to escape from the muddy things clawing at its body.

This probably doesnt make any sense lmao but sigh needed to vent somewhere about it"

Like I apologize a lot to my mom when I mess up and she says that when I act like that or act small itâ€™s like kicking a small puppy and comes across as manipulative and trying to make her feel bad. Iâ€™m not trying to manipulate, I just genuinely feel sad and guilty sometimes

CPTSD,Petty responses to therapy?,"I really dislike being told to do breathing exercises! Itâ€™s not even that Iâ€™m sure they wonâ€™t work - itâ€™s something about how small of a thing it is.

Iâ€™ve recently read that polyvagal theories are discredited, which didnâ€™t surprise me at all. Not that thatâ€™s all breathing exercises are, of course. Thereâ€™s a lot of evidence for their efficacy. 

itâ€™s a lot of things, I guess. A lot of small things. I have a hard time being openly petty, even if the desire to resist is there. Itâ€™s like the pettiness has to find weak spots to force its way out, and those weak spots are variants of â€œdoes my therapist know what theyâ€™re on about, or is this just more bullshit and weâ€™ve decided to legitimize it as a society, for a lack of better options?â€

CPTSD,I used to be an abuser,"Tw for sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. 

[disclaimer: I actually had zero memories of this up until 3 hours ago. I found all of this info on social media and still donâ€™t know if actually did one these things. I have little to no memories at all of these incidents.]


Okay. I know the title sounds fucken awful, because it is. Iâ€™m a recovered abuser. I am a case of the abused becomes the abuser. When I was 13-14 I was a violent and scared child. I was being severely abused in several ways and had been since infancy. I grew up thinking love was pain and misery, and that I was creature meant to be used sexually. 

I then hurt a person, who weâ€™ll call W. I was 13 when we first started dating. I was mean and violent at times. I once stabbed them with my house key because they had said a triggering phrase and had provoked me do so. This had left simply a scrape, but that doesnâ€™t really matter.

I used this poor boy as a therapist, dumping all of my tales of abuse on him and sobbing in his arms on multiple occasions. I confined in him about my abuse and at times put pressure on him to help save me. Which never happened of course. He had no means of saving me without possibly being killed by my abuser. 

This is the part I have no memory about. He accused me of sexually assaulting him. I have no memory of this at all, I have no memories of ever being intimate with him at all. Though I honestly donâ€™t doubt this claim. I was being heavily sexually abused by several men at this time and thought of my only life purpose as being an object to be used. I can bet one day I tried to get him to reenact the abuse so that I could feel like my purpose was being fulfilled.

Now iâ€™m almost 19 and I feel like a monster. I only ever had memories of him hurting me, but I didnâ€™t know I had hurt him first. I feel fucken awful. I know iâ€™m not that hurt kid anymore, but I canâ€™t help but be extremely disgusted by my past actions. I have gone through intense therapy to recover from everything, but I swear remembering all of this has set me back. I feel just horrible. How could I do that to a person? After everything iâ€™ve been through I turned around and repeated the same abuse I was facing at home. It may have not been anywhere as extreme, but still. I still did those things. I hurt a person. 

I know that psychology would likely explain younger me actions, but I know that it doesnâ€™t matter. I know that my abuse isnâ€™t an excuse. I donâ€™t quite know what to do with these memories. Iâ€™m not the same person anymore. Iâ€™ve been in a healthy relationship for over a year now, iâ€™ve kindled lovely friendships and iâ€™ve been forgiven by who younger me did wrong. But for W his case was the worst. No one else had I abused. I will never be able to apologize to him. It would be selfish for me to msg him and try to apologize. I donâ€™t know what to do now. I know I need to talk to my therapist about this and possibly go into intensive care again to try and be better."
CPTSD,Horror,"I am lying in bed, shaking. My heart is pounding and I just had a flashback. I know Iâ€™m going to have another one soon because I can feel the fear building in my throat. I want to scream but I also canâ€™t make a sound.

I tried listening to music but it overwhelmed me. I thought about texting the crisis text line but Iâ€™m not in crisis, just terrified. I tried getting up to take a shower but my muscles are weak and I canâ€™t stand. 

I feel so small and alone. All of my support people are asleep.

Please someone tell me Iâ€™m going to be okay."
CPTSD,Sneak Attacks,"I realize that as bad as the sort of ritualistic physical abuse was, when I think of the very moment I had my peace of mind permanently broken it was a sneak attack. I was probably 8 or 9 and sitting on the living room floor in the â€œWâ€ position. He came up from behind me and clappedðŸ’¥ðŸ‘‚ðŸ» me open hand on the right ear. I was in shock for I donâ€™t know how long. I was fully catatonic, like blind with your eyes open and frozen. I guess it scared them enough to try and not hit me in head anymore. As I wrote this I realize now that I had hurt my neck at my cousinâ€™s house. I was temporarily paralyzed and two vertebrae shifted a little. At the hospital theyâ€™re asking a lot of questions of course, nurses and doctors and a while later a man came in and asked me how it happened and if it was an adult that had done something. I told them that I was hit in the head pretty bad, but they didnâ€™t take me to the hospital. I know there was some sort of confrontation with my stepdad, but nothing ever happened because of it. 
They say if youâ€™re accused of something you have not done, you should react with some anger. And an aggressive denial. Thatâ€™s exactly what people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder always do."
CPTSD,My mom has Zoomed in photos of my genitals from when I was a baby.,"
My mind canâ€™t wrap my head around this being sexual abuse. The photos are super, super zoomed in in different positions. When I was 12, my family and I looked through a photo album and BAM multiple pictures of my genitals. The person who was there with us flipping through photos made a joke that my mom clearly wanted to go to jail.

I repeat, I was a BABY

She just laughed along like they were regular baby photos. 

Is this abuse? Is this child porn? I donâ€™t know where the photos are. 

My therapist said itâ€™s sexual abuse and I justâ€¦. I canâ€™t process it"
CPTSD,Things that help me sleep. If you do something else that works please let me know.,"Like most people on here, night can be a horrible time for me. If you need help with bed time, some of these might help. If you do something else that works, please leave a comment of what it is. Best wishes to all of you. 

I have a smart light that I use for a night light. It is 100% customizable to my needs. It's very soothing to not be in a room totally dark. It's in a lamp beside my bed. This has provided a lot of relief.  
  
I sleep with my dog, I know no one is in the house because he is sleeping. If a pet is a no go, try a stuffed animal, it may help. If a stuffed animal is not an option, place a pillow against your back to simulate safe contact if that is not triggering for you.   
  
Fragrance, I wear a soothing cologne to bed, it sounds ridiculous but it helps me stay grounded. If you don't want to do that, find a room fragrance that makes you think of happy thoughts and to relax, baking spices, vanilla, anything you like.  
  
If you have something in your room potentially triggering, get rid of it. A jacket hanging on a hook would freak me out because it looked like someone was in my room. There is nothing hanging, nothing by the door, etc. in my room. I sleep with a loud fan and my bedroom door open.   
  
Try a cooler room. Cooler temperatures help us sleep better.

Some people swear by a weighted blanket.   
  
Sleep hygiene, super important. Leave your cell phone somewhere else, turn off electronics 30 minutes before bed, anything stimulating try to limit including reading. I have tried meditation with mixed results. I usually just lay in bed and do relaxation techniques until I fall asleep.   
  
On bad nights I say to hell with it and I just get out of bed and do something totally mindless that is not stimulating. like sit on the couch and count things, do grounding technique etc. Way better than laying there thinking what if, or I don't deserve whatever.  


I had really good results with nightmare protocols. [https://embracechangetherapy.com/2021/09/29/the-nightmare-protocol/](https://embracechangetherapy.com/2021/09/29/the-nightmare-protocol/)

CPTSD,i want to get worse,"tw: self harm, suicide attempt, invalidation by medical professionals

i want to get worse. like i feel like at this point im not suffering enough

my ex therapist invalidated me a long time ago and ever since then ive been feeling like im not ill enough. that im not actually mentally ill, that my abuse wasnâ€™t worse enough, that i hadnâ€™t suffered enough. she refused to call my trauma as it is, told me i played a role in it. that i donâ€™t need therapy and coped just fine

ive attempted suicide before, but ive never been hospitalised. itâ€™s because i didnâ€™t do it right. 
ive self harmed before, and at some point my therapist saw the scars and dismissed them. i now feel like i have to self harm more and worse enough to get sent to er 

like i feel like at this point im not looking to heal, i just want to fucking become worse enough to get acknowledged by a medical professional for once. being repeatedly invalidated by medical professionals only makes me feel like getting help is a waste of time and money and that i should just keep on getting worse until they finally acknowledge my symptoms"
CPTSD,i feel like im the worst person on the planet,"tw; sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse 

im 25, and my mom raised me with sexual, physical, and emotional abuse (extreme shaming and guilt) -  over the past few years, this has all come to light, and despite being a doctor in my field; now that I'm aware of what happened to me in my childhood, I can't really function.   


I'm in therapy, and sure. Im making progress. but i still cant be truthful with my psych. i dont trust him. i dont trust anyone - and i dont know how not to. I want to trust people. I want to have friends and do fun stuff with people, but I just - don't trust anyone. every single person in my life has abused me in some way - and it's so hard to believe that there are real life people out there who aren't out to be mean to me.   


its just - there are so many limitations that my brain is putting on me - and it's infuriating. the things that I used to be able to do I now can't: i cant go grocery shopping, i cant go for walks, a lot of the time I can't even leave my bedroom. i cant even really have sex today - and get this, I want a human to degrade me and make me feel like the worst person on the planet and or do borderline unethical things to me - and i dont understand why.   


im just frozen, all the time. i dont know. its so hard to believe that I have to be alive for the next 50 years. i dont know. does it get better? i want to have hope. "
CPTSD,I am my worst abuser,"After a lifetime of emotional/mental abuse through so many different people, I have become that person for myself. Anytime I feel a negative emotion, I gaslight myself by saying Iâ€™m crazy or overreacting. I genuinely do not know if my feelings are justified. 

I am currently in a relationship (almost year and a half) and the only arguments with my partner are about the same issue - his female coworker and my uncomfortably with their relationship. It is to the point that Iâ€™m ready to leave the relationship. I feel I am too sick and he does not deserve to deal with me, that I am just too much but I donâ€™t know. Am I really the one who is blowing it out of proportion or is he just not respecting me? 

I hate being this person. I hate not knowing real from my imagination. I hate not trusting anyone around me. I hate my brain. I just want an off switch. No medication is helping. I am beyond numb. Therapy is so expensive. I want to be cured, saved, fixed or something. I donâ€™t want to keep operating like this. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m exhausted."
CPTSD,DAE have random nightmares every night,"Iâ€™ve been having (multiple) nightmares almost every night for more than a year now. I was prescribed Prazosin for it but Iâ€™m bad at taking it & it sometimes just doesnâ€™t work for some reason. The thing is that my nightmares are never related to anything thatâ€™s actually happened to me. Theyâ€™re always random stressful scenarios like stepping in glass or missing a final, occasionally something more intense like a person dying but the situation is always completely absurd & full of dream logic. I wake up briefly after they end, fall back asleep, maybe have another nightmare like this, and every morning Iâ€™m sweaty & have damp clothes. I canâ€™t find things online about this since usually the information about recurring nightmares in a PTSD context is about reliving traumatic events. Has anyone had something similar happen/found a way to manage it?"
CPTSD,Do they ever stop,Iâ€™ve had almost nightly. Existential panic attacks: canâ€™t think of another way to explain it simply: my brains just kicks over to the scary thoughts of death and what happens after this life.also becomes hyper aware of my body. Had these since childhood. Itâ€™s gotten to the point I can push it back for a little while.. I just want to know. Iâ€™m not alone dealing with this issue
CPTSD,I drink way to much caffeine,I'm not 100% sure if this is related to cptsd but i consume ungodly amounts of caffeine like 300-500mg a day from energy drinks. It calms me and makes me super drowsy so it's kind of become an anxiety reducer for me since the meds ive tried have been ineffective. I tend to drink more caffeine the worse I'm doing mentally and it can get to the point where I'm having 800mg in a couple hours. I'm wondering if anyone else has a similar reaction or reliance on caffeine?
CPTSD,Figured out a big shame trigger,"Iâ€™ve noticed that when I listen to music or come across certain videos on social media, I feel this jarring urge to shut down and look away from the content. I realized that this is triggered because the artist creating the media is taking up space in some regard (e.g. a musical artist sings loudly/unconventionally, someone is dancing confidently online, etc.). I think it stems from 1. Shame about taking up space and feeling like I canâ€™t and 2. Shame about my personal taste/interests. To combat this, Iâ€™ve been listening to a lot of the music that made me feel uneasy and finding joy in it through dancing to it. Iâ€™ve been watching people be loud and joyful in YouTube videos/videos on social media. This may seem silly or a strange place to derive shame from, but this was an interesting realization for me and Iâ€™m proud of taking up more space than Iâ€™m used to."
CPTSD,feeling like its all my fault,"i was the one who isolated myself. i was the one who didnt want to talk about anything. i was the shy one, i was the scared one. always always scared. sometimes out of spite, but always out of fear, i shut down. i derived pleasure knowing i knew what was going on, but they didnt. i maintained some sort of control or power by keeping it all to myself while they experienced all the typical drama and chaos. 

but i feel like it was all my fault, all this damage... i would go literal years not hanging out with anyone from my schools. i isolated myself so extremely. i had internet friends, but they caused more trauma, and i feel like thats my fault too. the other day my mom told me all that internet wasnt. good for me. it wasnt...but at the same time, that was my socialization.

now because of my isolation and damage, i have no idea how to be a real person. and i feel like its all my fault. maybe not entirely my fault, but mostly"
CPTSD,Is it normal to see person-like silhouettes in the corner of your eye?,"Google tells me I am having a stroke. Pretty sure I don't have one though.

But from time to time, I will think ""wait, someone's in my room because I see something that I identify as a person's silhouettes. When I turn, they are gone, sometimes I see why I saw a silhouette (i.e. because a bush lookes really ""person-like""), sometimes I do not. Yet, I have the feeling that this is not normal. To be honest, it scares me quite a bit.

I might have the same thing for noises. Like gaming at 4 in the morning and thinking ""there's someone in the hallway"". I feel myself tensing up, I take off my headset, and I listen - and then there's nothing.

Why? This is kind of scaring me. Is that a traume response, some sort of hypervigilance? Or is this something else?

Also excuse if this is the wrong subreddit"
CPTSD,"Friends are getting married, I am triggered like hell because Iâ€™ll never experience that"," I donâ€™t know how to get out of this trigger now? Iâ€™ve cried for literal hours after getting the news of engagement, then of the wedding. Please someone tell me itâ€™s ok to NOT go. 

As a matter of fact, I am not single, but he has no desire to get married ever. This isnâ€™t â€œnot ready yetâ€, this is the â€œI donâ€™t believe in marriageâ€ type. 

My trauma stems from people telling me horrible things for years about my relationship because weâ€™re not married to the point that I am very traumatised.

 I tried therapy, but it didnâ€™t work. I hate and find it weird to open up like that to a stranger I pay. They probably deal with much sadder, serious cases than mine, a lot of people donâ€™t understand or take me seriously if I said I have wedding/marriage ptsd."
CPTSD,Iâ€™m scared and donâ€™t know what to do,"Iâ€™m tipsy/a little drunk rn so I apologize in advance for any errors.

80% of the time I (21 yr) feel completely unequipped to deal with the real world. Besides having CPTSD, I have so much fear for the future because of climate change, whether or not Iâ€™ll have love/happiness in my life, and more recently a sense of obligation to care for my family once my motherâ€™s generation passes away. 

I started using weed for mh and chronic pain, but sometimes I wish I could just be high all the time, the world feels brighter and less terrifying. Same with alcohol. I just want to feel safe and at peace, I donâ€™t need substances to feel this way, but itâ€™s the consistency I crave. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m making sense, but I just want to be happy. Addiction doesnâ€™t run in my family, but I worry that Iâ€™ll develop it.

And just to be clear, I am in therapy and will talk to my therapist about this  the next time I see them"
CPTSD,Sharing the brutal truths of healing,"As my therapist likes to say, healing isn't all rainbows and butterflies. 

No matter how hard I ""tried"" to be different, I picked up many ways of relating to the world from my abusers (ie, my family of origin). 

Left untreated, my emotional dysregulation, inability to self-sooth, hyper sensitivity to criticism,  mental fragmentation, numbing, narcissism, and addictions would inevitably perpetuate the cycle of abuse as a significant other or parent. 

My wife is not my surrogate mother who I subconsciously expect to be perfectly attuned to me. 

The world is not responsible for tiptoeing around my triggers.

I interpret many perfectly neutral interactions to be critical or negative. 

As a full grown adult, I have an ability to set healthy boundaries, to take care of myself, and to accept myself lovingly that I am abdicating to others. 

The way through these issues is not control, isolation, or self harm. It is through self awareness and taking responsibility to slowly learn what I should have as a child through reparenting myself. 

It isn't easy, pleasant, or fast, but these lessons have already saved my marriage and in many ways, myself.

What brutal truths have most helped you heal?"
CPTSD,Does CPTSD always stem from childhood trauma?,"Iâ€™m pretty sure I have CPTSD, but I donâ€™t think my childhood was super traumatic apart from being put in a bunch of therapies for my autism and my mum constantly shouting at my siblings and I due to her own unresolved trauma. 

Does CPTSD always stem from childhood trauma? Iâ€™ve been told that you have to experience long term chronic trauma in order to develop it but I donâ€™t think I had that traumatic a childhood, so Iâ€™m really wondering why I seem to have it.

Maybe Iâ€™ve repressed some of the memories of traumatic experiences in my childhood but I always thought I had a really good memory so that seems unlikely that Iâ€™d have repressed memories."
CPTSD,Vent/rant and maybe advice possible trigger warning,"Just disappointed in myself for having a small glips of hope that my mom will change and get better and care about me. But she hast changed. It still gets regardless. And I hate I stress cry/throw up.

All my mom does is make false promises. 
And that she still says I will be anhry over something when last time I gotten angry like that bad was like I was 14.  And I want help with getting my license like information and on the road testing type. And all that and thats how I depend on her is for her to take me places since bus/taxi/Uber sucks a lot in my area. 

I want to go no contact since it's only hurting me not helping me like she is still upset at me for cps being involved and the fact she still drinks bad still and smokes non stop. Like I kept reminding my mom my shifts end at 6:30 she still gets mad at me she doesn't get enough time at home and ends up attempting to get me at 5:30 when  I reminded her it's 6:30.

Just wish I gotten some air hugs. And to be heard. 

I  have having childhood trauma is  bad enough it's literally effecting my work some way/shape/form. And I work 2 days a week and still stressed out


(Edit) there plenty of things she said or done or her exs done but you know the point is that I'm just not happy) "
CPTSD,Glass Frog?,"I watched a Patrick Teahan on the 11 things people struggle with because of childhood trauma and one them was glass frog, or the feeling that youâ€™re raw and exposed in social settings and everyone knows what happened to you, what youâ€™re thinking and what youâ€™ve done. This is so hard for me. He says to imagine an imaginary force field around you. Iâ€™m trying this tomorrow at a new church weâ€™re attending. Can anyone relate?"
CPTSD,Reconnecting with friends,"I went to hang out with some friends from college I had not seen in years. I was very anxious especially when my closest friend, whose place we were gathering at, gave me a huge hug and a loud yell in my ears. I'm sure they could tell my nervousness with a lot of questions and talking as I walked in. I calmed down after awhile and got situated. Night goes on and things seem to settle down, I make my rounds having decent conversations with everyone. 

I did kind of vent about my family and a friend but I didn't see it as such since it was more of a funny if dark story. After it gets mentioned I move to the table where it was all females until I took a seat. The woman who I am/was the closest to was joking about naming her kids after me and mentioning about some guy hitting on her and making out. I didn't think much of it at the time but later on I started noticing more direct flirting, getting close, light touches, bring me into conversations.

Well eventually she gets a little too tipsy and we all start to leave so she can go to bed. I message her the next day just seeing how she was and letting her know I appreciated seeing all of them. She mentions how her life is in a bit of phase but nothing detailed or serious. I let her know about my condition and what not and she really seems to be understanding. I invite her out that weekend again with another mutual friend of course but she is busy. I understand as it was the day of when I asked and told her I look foward to our ""late friendsgiving"". Eventually I try to lighten the mood in our chats for the next couple days. But I began to have flashbacks to how it used to be, that caring demeanor she had for me and still seems to have for me. I try to flirt back over text and she seems to enjoy it until I make a joke about how ""our daughter(s)"" would act. 

There is no response,so no big deal. Figure it didn't land, I then text if she would like to go to a comedy show for next month. No response and I assume she is ignoring the message which is fine but has raised my anxiety to a whole other level as I try to restain myself from messaging her again. I haven't but now I feel like I have reconnected and made things awkward. I am waiting to see if she gives me a more formal invite to friendsgiving since she never verified the date and time yet. I know I'll be all right no matter what happens and this seems pretty light comapred to what I have read in here. Just needed to vent it out as I feel I have wasted all other eyes and ears. I am fortunate to have an already solid group of people from different areas of my life. I just worry I'll wear them out as well. Even as I finish writing this I am worried of any responses but I appreciate this space."
CPTSD,What are your daily routines/resources?,"This really Iâ€™m really committing to getting myself out of the funk Iâ€™ve slowly gone into over the last few years. Didnâ€™t realize it was CPTSD until three months ago. Iâ€™m holding myself accountable to working out consistently, trying yoga, and daily meditation. I see a therapist once a week and had to quickly learn that the work has to be done outside of the session. What are some meditation videos/apps that you use? Do you just listen to the same one over and over? I want to give myself a daily routine without having to pay more money or find myself scrolling for a while looking for a video. The goal is 15-20 minutes a day. Any advice would be great!"
CPTSD,Present but absent,"What's worse? A father who leaves his children behind and never comes back? Or a father who's present but absent; physically present, but absent as an equal to his wife and protector of the children.  
When it comes to recovery from Complex PTSD, or grief, or really any condition, it's never a good idea to compare whose plight is better or worse.  
Recovery is personal.  
Your pain is not the same as mine.  
You process grief at the loss of a loved one differently than I do.  
We each have our own recovery.  
When it comes to my Father, he was a good, kind man.  
He was the youngest child in his family, raised by a cold woman alone after her husband died.  
No affection, no humor, no sunshine.  
Knowing my father the way I knew him...a good, kind, warm man...it had to have been hard on him as a child to not know the love or affection of a mother.  
Always cold and lacking of warmth. And there was no nurturing.  
As the youngest, he modeled himself after other boys.  
If they drank, he drank.  
If they went to the Army, he went to the Army.  
My Mom married a man who was clearly unfinished business.  
She helped him become a man and father. She helped him become spiritual.  
She helped him express himself appropriately in front of the kids.  
But he was still human and unfinished.  
At a time when men worked long hours, did the physical labor, came home, had a drink and a meal and went to bed.  
He was present, for sure, in the big picture.  
But absent when it came to protecting his boy from predators.  
My sexual abuse, on the surface, could have been avoided if my Mom didn't have a case of ""hero worship"" when it came to Catholic priests.  
She's the one that made it happen - she invited the predator into the house.  
She encouraged me to go with him.  
She made it happen.  
She lit the match.  
She put the fox in the henhouse.  
And that's why it's easy to blame her for everything.  
Her personality and mental illness and tendency to belittle her children didn't help garner sympathy.  
It's understandable if no one came to her defense.  
In my family, she was the bad cop. My Dad the good cop.  
And that's where the irony kicks in.  
My Dad WAS a policeman. Sworn to serve and protect.  
Yet where was he when the fox was led into the henhouse by my Mom?  
Where was he when he could have stepped in to question allowing a family friend to take me on a trip unsupervised?  
He could have stopped it all.  
He could have put my Mom in her place, or at least taken an equal interest in deciding whether I should go on a trip alone with an adult long-ago family friend 500 miles from home.  
He could have said ""the boy is not going on that trip"".  
But he didn't.  
And that's the hole the predator crawls through to capture its prey.  
Sexual predators find the weak link in the chain and exploit it.  
The boy on the outside of the cool kids group on the playground.  
The boy with the absentee father.  
The boy who desperately seeks a male role model or father figure  
Or, in my case, knowing the hard-working, kind father of mine deferred to my overbearing Mom who made all the calls and decisions when it came to who I could be left unsupervised with.  
The predator is always looking for the opening.  
And that's where my Dad failed.  
He was present in my life for sure.  
But when it came to protecting me from the predator, he was absent.  
Rest in Peace Dad. I forgive you and I love you."
CPTSD,How do I deal with being alone?,"This has probably been answered before, but.. Am I the only one who feels like I canâ€™t be alone? I feel like I canâ€™t survive when I am alone and I constantly need someone I am close with to be around me most of the time. To have someone who will pull me out of bed and who helps me become productive. When I have to do things solo I become really anxious and in turn, that makes me mess up everything, even simple things. 

I donâ€™t know what to do or how to cope with this, any advice would be appreciated."
CPTSD,"Iâ€™ll be 25 this summer, no one intervened in the end. No one really cared and now Iâ€™m in my mid 20s","Idk I have a lot of grief right now in terms of feeling betrayed and disappointed. I had to put so much energy into climbing out of my trainwreck childhood and escaping abuse.

I see people I went to school with who were much luckier and sometimes not necessarily that (I really donâ€™t mean this in a bad way) smart or passionate or interested. Theyâ€™re sort of just blissfully unaware and went after stability from a place of stability and got it. 

Iâ€™m struggling always in poverty etc. Yes Iâ€™m making progress, but because my childhood was so full of pain, Iâ€™ve made it my mission to actually follow my dream. Itâ€™s not an easy dream but itâ€™s doable if you work hard and youâ€™re the one of the best. 

The entire reason Iâ€™m still pursuing this dream is because I know I will be  alone, no one is coming to save me ever, and I feel that I shouldnâ€™t have to give up on the thing I love the most (and always loved) because my parents were deranged and envious and tried to destroy me. But also, Iâ€™m sadly not as sharp as I was 10 years ago. All of the traumas and isolation finally got to me, and about four or five years ago I realised I was never getting past the psychometric pre-interview tests for certain jobs and internships that I had been on track to do. This was extra motivation for me to leave behind the stable path (law) and go after what I really wanted. 

But itâ€™s hard, nearly impossible with all of the extra bs I have to go through. And Iâ€™m broke, it started when my parents basically forced me into debt when I was 18. I feel like I never stood a chance in some ways. 

Iâ€™m making progress but all of this requires a transformation for myself, if I want to be successful at what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m completely alone, I have no history (no record or proof of what happened to me), no savings, no support.

I guess the main issue right now is that is triggering me is the way Iâ€™ve just been stuck in this cycle of poverty that ruined so many opportunities. I have been stuck in a living situation that is making me poorer, and I canâ€™t leave to rent elsewhere because I donâ€™t have a guarantor and canâ€™t pay three months upfront. Itâ€™s I am studying now 4 days a week and working three days, I can only really cover my living expenses. And I know it feels like a cop out to blame my childhood butâ€¦ I knew this would happen. Not even in a sense of a self fulfilling prophecy, but because I was a smart kid and I made the calculations and assessed the likelihood of everything."
CPTSD,I FINALLY figured out the problem!,"Weâ€™ve been brainwashed! Thereâ€™s nothing inherently wrong with us, despite what our subconscious brains have been led to believe, weâ€™ve just had the misfortune of being put in abusive environments that cleverly gaslighted us into thinking that *weâ€™re* the problem.

Children, in order to survive abuse, modify their behavior and thinking as if itâ€™s *their* fault. Maybe this is reinforced if you were bullied in school. And if you grew up in America or other individualist nations, youâ€™re constantly told about how any misfortunes that happen to people are the fault of the individuals suffering, not systems, and that â€œthere is no such thing as societyâ€.

However, itâ€™s just indoctrination, not inherent truth. Had we been born in better environments, weâ€™d be the same person, but with much healthier self-image beliefs. Itâ€™s the same as how a person born into a tribal cult wouldnâ€™t have their beliefs if they were born into a different tribe; itâ€™s just cultural indoctrination, not inherent truth. Once this is truly understood, the only remaining question is of how to *undo* the brainwashing."
CPTSD,Could someone please explain to me where intuition ends and paranoia begins? Thanks.,"I always had a difficulty trusting my gut and I'm one those people whom are regarded as ""omg, you're so psychic!"", which I'm sure many (if not all) here relate. Trauma enhances pattern recognition and all that, I'm sure there's a study about it somewhere... 
 
Anyway, I'm also having a hard time trusting other people. I think my relationship is making me this way or I'm making me thus way? I don't know, it's all hazy. Thanks."
CPTSD,I don't know what to do anymore,"I struggle to socialise, find people who understand or make friends with any common interests and I just feel alone and like I don't fit in anywhere. I have no life, no qualifications, no hope for my future, I can't sleep and I'm having bladder issues and the test came back negative so that means I'll probably have to get a blood test or something and I already struggle with anxiety about that stuff. I had to wait two weeks for a doctor's appointment, missed it because I can't sleep and now have to wait another two weeks. I just wish I wasn't alive anymore. I haven't slept very well at all in days and I desperately need help but I don't know what to do. My mental health is the worst it's ever been, I live in the UK and it just feels like there's no help at all. I wish I knew what to do I just want everything to end."
CPTSD,"Reminder: The mod team here is an all-volunteer group of people who themselves have CPTSD. They are not a ""them"" to your ""us."" It's just ""us.""","I retired from moderating here more than a year ago now, after a four year stint. I have since had regular conversations with the mods I left behind, and I learned another one has just stepped down due to stress, leaving a skeleton of a team in place (most of those names you see are inactive).

On their behalf, I want to let you all know a few things about how moderating works, so you can tune your criticism and feedback appropriately:

**Moderating is an unpaid volunteer position:** Angry people used to accuse me of gaining all kinds of things from moderating, most especially some kind of high from feeling powerful. I can assure you that regularly being called a dictator by racists and homophobes did not make me feel powerful. It made me feel triggered and stressed. After four years of moderating, I made a few friends, gained some vague sense that I did something good, probably grew into a more mature person than I otherwise would've been, and I made exactly zero dollars. That's all that's in it for a moderator of a space like this.

**Moderators are not responsible for what gets posted here:** Content moderation on the internet is a three-step process:

1. Assholes post
2. Witnesses report
3. Moderators clean

Don't make the mistake of blaming moderators for what happens in Step 1. This is a public community, and there is a never-ending string of randos waltzing in and saying whatever they want. Any specific comment you see is not any indication of what the mod team approves of, condones, or allows. It's just a turd someone left for all to see that has yet to be removed. The mod team is far too small to read every comment that comes through (and no, you could not have a big enough team to read everything. Not for free, anyway), so until you report it, that comment is going to stay up.

**The goal of moderating is a safe-ish space, not a safe space:** Because of the above reason, moderators can not and will never achieve creating a ""safe"" space. Safe spaces are small and private. Big, public online spaces are about as safe as a crowded city street. That's not the fault of the mod team; that's just the nature of a quarter million people using the same subreddit. Post and read here with that in mind.

**When you attack the mod team, you attack this community:** As a moderator here, you spend a lot of your time reading a lot of terrible stuff. You put yourself in the middle of fights, deal with people who are wildly triggered and out of control, and you confront a lot of really awful people who are just here to cause trouble. It's a very stressful job and if they didn't do it, this community would be shut down. I mean that literally; Reddit shuts down unmoderated communities. So be mindful when talking to them, giving feedback, or if you really have to, giving criticism. Don't put your issues on them, don't treat them like ""others"", and don't use them as an opportunity to vent your frustration with authority. Remember: They are volunteers with CPTSD just trying to do a good job. For free.

That's all, I guess. Incidentally they are now short-staffed, so if you feel like taking on this difficult, thankless job, shoot them a message in mod mail. I'm sure they'd appreciate it, and the community will be better for it.

Thanks."
CPTSD,Does anyone else live with C-PTSD from narcissistic sibling abuse?,Trigger warnings please
CPTSD,I have to put down my cat and I donâ€™t know how to cope,"Last night I found out my 10 year old cat has a terminal condition. My family and I cannot afford the monthly treatment so we decided to put him to sleep so he isnâ€™t in pain at least.

I still live at home and itâ€™s been hard having to continue to live in the same environment that has caused me so much pain. I have no healthy relationships within my family, I have no friends or acquaintances, and Iâ€™m on winter break for school so I canâ€™t even drown myself in schoolwork. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do. It sounds stupid, but this cat is literally the only being who has shown me anything close to unconditional love. Itâ€™s like every website, forum, therapist, friend, etc. recommends a pet during a hard time. I know itâ€™s for the best and I would never make him deal with the pain just to be here for me, but I have no idea what to do because I am having to say goodbye to the only thing I have close to a support system as pathetic as that sounds. 

Iâ€™ve dealt with pet loss before, but this time is so so different. Iâ€™m crying not only because I am losing my best friend, but also crying knowing I have to go through these next few years on my own. Cuddling with my cat has been the closest thing I have had to a hug in years. I wish I was being dramatic when I say that I have no one else to turn to. 

Any advice about coping is welcomed and appreciated. As long as it isnâ€™t get a new pet, because I canâ€™t."
CPTSD,Medication Burnout,"Anyone else get frustrated with how much stress psyche medication puts on your body? Seriously, it's so frustrating. I'll live my life like a normal person, but at least twice a week with no warning whatsoever my body just shuts down from the strain.

I just get overcome with exhaustion and I just sleep for 16-24 hrs and I cannot shake myself out of it.

I know it's my meds because when I'm off then I don't have this issue. My doctor has mentioned that some psyche meds like mine will effect your metabolism, causing crashes like this.

But it is so debilitating. I literally cannot function at all. I can't drive because I'm so tired I feel drunk. I can't cook. I can barely summon the energy to use the bathroom, feed my cat and make a bowl of cereal.

Otherwise I'm basically fucking helpless. I'm essentially a zombie with no ability to focus. I can't even hold a conversation.

And if course the meds that don't do this don't work for me."
CPTSD,"Depressed when unproductive, depressed and stressed when productive","I noticed while on winter break from college that despite â€œenjoyingâ€ free time I was also becoming more depressed by each day that passed. But the thing is that I was still depressed (maybe a bit less) when I was somewhat productive during the last term, but I was also stressed out all the time even if the coursework wasnâ€™t a problem. 

Does anyone else have this problem? How do I even work around this when nothing seems to work..?"
CPTSD,What should I do?,"Iâ€™ve got PTSD and I was on a date and I got triggered by a his aftershave, and I went into a dissociative episode and started arguing with him because he reminded me of my abuser. Itâ€™s all a blur.

Iâ€™ve been avoiding him since because I donâ€™t think he wants to talk to me again because he hasnâ€™t messaged me. 

He hasnâ€™t blocked me and heâ€™s only called me once but Iâ€™ve been avoiding him because I am so embarrassed. I canâ€™t believe I messed up, and heâ€™s probably forgotten about me now"
CPTSD,"â€œSafe personâ€, close friend of 15 years, lashed out, I shutdown, & he subsequently stonewalled & ended relationship.","I (34M) have ptsd/anxiety/depression stemming from severe, long-term abuse (all forms) from infancy through young adulthood. I am also ND (which may be relevant re: communication styles & my failure to understand/see red flags until it was too late). I have been no-contact with my family of origin for decades. I have spent the last 6+ years in intensive trauma therapy and have achieved the most safety and security Iâ€™ve ever had. That sense of safety & security was negatively impacted by an interaction I had with a formerly ""safe person"" & the fall-out from it.

Earlier this year, I reconnected with an old friend (35M) from school after I relocated (we had been communicating regularly for the last five years). Back in the day, he was the first and only person to explicitly tell teenage me that my family did not treat me well, and that I did not deserve it (I couldnâ€™t see it; a fish in water). That comment changed the course of my life, and I will be forever grateful for it.

Fast forward to this fall, we started exploring our sexual connection for the first time. My body and nervous system felt safer with him than with anyone else; I was able to be fully present and vulnerable, and it felt like he was as well. Over 2.5 months, there had been two (what I thought were) small miscommunications during intimate activities that we did not discuss. So we set time aside to meet. We intended, mainly, to debrief what happened a week earlier when I was triggered into an emotional flashback for the first time during play (he stopped, supported me, and the flashback resolved; I subsequently, unconsciously regressed/was vulnerable during aftercare).

When we sat down, everything felt fine. I was embarrassed about getting triggered and regressing (this had never happened before). I explained that it was not his fault, and it was only because I felt safe with him/supported, and that now I was aware of \[the trigger\], I would be mindful moving forward. I then turned to ask him about his experience/thoughts/feelings.

He paused, and I felt the room chill. I looked up and saw a flash of surprise/contempt, the smirk, and then his eyes went black (I am very familiar with these expressions/changes in demeanor, from personal and professional experience). Time slowed down. I had never seen this side of him, and froze. He stood up from the couch, physically moved closer to me, and raised his voice for the first time in my presence. All I remember is the look on his face, hearing him yell â€œthat wasnâ€™t what I wanted at all!â€,being seized with terror, and then blacking out.

When I came to, over an hour had gone by, and I was curled up in a fetal position on the couch (my head was down at a severe angle; it had been that way the whole time). As my awareness started to come back, I realized that I/part of me was crying and whispering in a small voice â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€ and  â€œIâ€™m so ashamed.â€ I could not look at him, but I heard him say simply: *â€œGood.â€* That shook me awake. He was then telling me that he did not want to be intimate with me anymore and that he was indifferent re: continuing our friendship. He got up to leave shortly thereafter, hugged me and said ""I am not giving up on this relationship."" I was so confused even after he left, because he was here for roughly 90 minutes, I only remembered the first 10-15, and I felt like a sad, guilty, and scared younger version of myself.

In the days after, he refused to engage in conversation. Over the course of 4 days, I sent him 3 voice memos in my triggered/activated state, trying to explain what happened during the sit-down and the week before, and apologizing/blaming myself for all of it. A week later, back in my present mind, I sent him another reiterating that I had no memory of our sit-down and needed to know what he observed/remembered. A few days before Xmas, he replied via text that he could not continue with our relationship and blocked me.

This experience was unnerving, re-traumatizing, and dysregulating. Only now, weeks later, am I starting to feel safe again. I was blindsided and felt betrayed, by both his destructive expression of contempt/anger, projection of toxic shame, as well as him fleeing/blocking me after I told him that I needed to know what happened when I was shut down.  I could not help but feel like he blamed me for my flashbacks, despite being aware of them/my trauma, as well as for bringing them up/trying to have a dialogue.

Looking back, there were a handful of red-ish flags that emerged over the last few months, mostly some passive aggressiveness and negging; he seemed to approach some of our platonic interactions like there was some power play, but it was entirely one-sided. *OTOH*, he always did whatever he said he was going to do, supported me in concrete ways (pet care; medical emergency), and his words and actions usually aligned.

He was the first person I've let in/been fully myself with in many years. I feel so stupid for trusting him all this time, for letting him into my home and my adult life, and for not being able to defend myself in the moment. I donâ€™t know whether we will ever speak again, or when/if I will recover the memories from the shutdown. I wish he had just left me alone. I find myself wondering when he decided to target me (premeditated or opportunistic), if he has always hated me or why he pretended to be my friend all this time.

**Is there some more charitable interpretation of events, or gray areas, that I'm not seeing? Is it possible that, despite the visible evidence to the contrary, this was not intentional/he did not enjoy it (he leans sadistic)? Or did I dodge a bullet, and should just focus on healing & moving on?**

TLDR; Friend lashed out and triggered a shutdown, refused to discuss it, and abruptly ended our 15-year relationship; I donâ€™t know whether he played a fucked up long-game for nearly two decades, or what the heck this was/what he got out of it."
CPTSD,Does CPTSD change brain and nervous system?,"Your symptoms are physical, NOT psychological. Your symptoms are as a result of biological processes, they are not â€œin your headâ€.

CPTSD,Cutting contact with my abusive dad and heâ€™s playing the victim,"Iâ€™m moving into my first apartment with my boyfriend in a week now and Iâ€™m viewing it as a fresh start. I want to healthy life worth living with my amazing boyfriend and chosen family and without those toxic people in my life that have been draining me. My dad is one of those people.

Ever since I was little my dad hasnâ€™t been a good person. He struggles with his mental health yes, but he uses it as an excuse to act out in toxic and abusive ways and treat people poorly without consequence. He has been coddled and catered to all his life. People walk on eggshells to avoid setting him off and I am sick of it. My childhood was full of trauma because of him. Anytime he didnâ€™t get his way he would act out and sometimes even try to hurt himself in front of me and my siblings. Police were called so many times, so many of his ex girlfriends would come and go, it was an insanely unstable environment. He always played the victim too. No matter what he was always the victim in every situation.

Over the years he would â€œget betterâ€ for a short period of time, but he always went back to his old self. No change has ever been genuine and seemed more like a game to him. He would pretend to be better and sometimes he would be really convincing but after a while I just stopped believing his act and started seeing him as he really was and honestly, I donâ€™t want that kind of person in my life at all. 

This is my fresh start and he doesnâ€™t get to be in it. Just today he was crying at me saying he didnâ€™t deserve any of this treatment and that I was acting like a brat. He said he wanted a relationship with me, but he doesnâ€™t even go out of his way to have a real conversation with me ever. He doesnâ€™t know me at all yet heâ€™s acting like he has every right to stay in my life like he owns me. 

Part of me feels bad but I feel like this is the right thing to do. Any advice? "
CPTSD,"Recovery advice re sex, flashbacks, and â€œrescueâ€ need","Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right place to post, but Iâ€™d genuinely appreciate any thoughts/reflections/own experiences (aside from therapy, which Iâ€™m in).

I learned as a chronically Iâ€™ll child with career driven and busy parents that I could â€œonlyâ€ be given affection and love if I was sick or hurt. (Iâ€™m not actually sure this is the case, and that my parents werenâ€™t affectionate with me otherwise, but this is whatâ€™s stuck..)

And so I went ahead and spent my teens and most of my twenties hurting myself as much as I possibly could by deliberately making my mental issues worse, engaging in self harm, seeking sexual relations that were degrading.
In short, I figured that that was how I thought I could earn/deserve some basic level of affection and care. 

Iâ€™ve been on a steady and good path of recovery for the past two years and have slowly been unravelling my issues and the consequences of this part of my past.  Obviously, I have issues, and as I unmask and deal with the real trauma I incurred on myself I find myself caught in between a rock and a hard place, especially in the context of sex.

Iâ€™ll occasionally experience emotional flashbacks and have intrusive thoughts pop up. Often Iâ€™m able to suppress them and mask over them, but usually that means that I over do it an am unable to really be present during the act itself. Like, it isnâ€™t super bad, and not as bad as it used to be where I would zone out entirely, but I definitely am not able to fully relax. At one level I also feel an element of guilt, as I know that to an extent I also need to not repress them in the moment. But at that moment I also feel like Iâ€™ll mentally be expecting the flashback/intrusive thoughts to pop up, so that Iâ€™m in a way â€œfishingâ€ for them. Itâ€™s at that point where I struggle knowing whether to shut out and mask or let it just happen, cause I know that thereâ€™s a side of me lurking that wants to have the trauma reaction it because I hope and  think that itâ€™ll give me that care and validation that I crave from my partner. 

Surely Iâ€™m not the only person to experience this crux and wonâ€™t be the last to either. Have any of you dealt with this, and have any thoughts to lend to think about the issue differently, or advice or resources or literally anything that may help me figure this out?"
CPTSD,I feel utterly lost and alone,"Do you ever spend days wracking your brain, trying to figure out what you might have done or said, what you *are doing* or *saying* that might be driving people away? What is making you alone? 

Why is it that other people are out on this Saturday evening with a group of friends while my phone is silent and I am home alone?

Why my own family cancels at the last minute from coming to events I try to plan, but turns up in droves for others?

Why friends whom you know are on their phone all the time don't get back to you for days on end?

I just...don't know what to do. I am utterly and completely confused, done, and want to give up. I truly do not know how to make things better.

...

I'm a 39 year old guy. I'm gay. I'm single. And I feel so alone.

I used to be very ""nice"". A people pleaser. That didn't really work.

So I tried to stop being a ""nice guy"". Read ""No more Mr Nice Guy"", tried to stop my people pleasing behaviors.

I am still alone. My family gets further away every year. I left Christmas early, I felt like an alien on Mars there.

Tried to be the initiator, reach out, plan events for friends and family to come to. They don't respond. They don't come. They say they will, then cancel.

I just don't know what to do.

I want to reach out to people and just be like ""Hey, I noticed you don't really reach out or respond to me, did I do something? Is there something I can do to make things better or improve our friendship???"" But then I hear that would be *too much*, and you gotta just let things go...

Why is life, why is forming basic human connections such a **game**??

You can't tell me the average people walking along the street or in the store or going through all these hoops too...it comes so naturally for them it seems. Why am I so alone? I don't know what to do."
CPTSD,Deep belly breathing.,"I did some deep belly breathing this evening.

And it feels like there is some giant fog lifted from my brain.

Was scrolling on here.
Feeling like I always struggle with everything and trying to look for answers.

I found a comment of someone saying deep belly breathing has helped me with the physical symptoms.

I figured why not try it out for 5 minutes.
After it I had some shakes and tears dropping.
20 min later.

Someone sent me something and I actually caught myself laughing.
While normally I would look anhedonically.

Never knew such small stuff can be so powerful.

To the one who made that comment I can't find it back but thank you."
CPTSD,Flashback with no immediate trauma?,"I heard a gunshot outside today and it immediately threw me into a flashback of green, woods and hills, or otherwise known as the place I grew up. 
I lived in the countryside so there were gunshot from here and there all the time, and I even grew up around guns and learning gun safety and whatnot. 
Never been threatened with a gun, been shot, had any bad experience aside from an upstairs neighbor incident a few years ago, but I wouldnâ€™t call that one traumatizing. 

The only correlation to trauma here would be that my childhood was very dark, abusive and so on. 
I feel like thereâ€™s probably a word for this, like when you smell something and it takes you back to a moment when you were young. Except this sort of thing normally doesnâ€™t happen with gunshotsâ€¦"
CPTSD,Congrats you survived the holidays,"Congrats, you did it. You're learning how to hang out with yourself. You're becoming more comfortable with being alone. I know it was scary. And it's okay to not want to be strong, sometimes you sit with defeat and then you just listen to yourself with no judgment. The last two Christmases and New Years have been triggering the abandonment wound. You might have been sad, missed loved ones, felt disappointed or grief because you wish things could have gone differently--but you made it and you were there for yourself the entire time. You protected your body and your heart. You committed to caring for yourself and that is beautiful. You did it for little you, the one who was scared, and they are proud of you."

CPTSD,Body finding new weird ways to express stress from cPTSD,Does anyone else experience their jaw uncontrollably quivering? It happens even when I canâ€™t cry. I will have an emotional flashback and my jaw shivers uncontrollably. Itâ€™s scary tbh. This is a new thing for me.
CPTSD,Emotional Flashbacks,"This may be a little long so please forgive me. My wife has CPTSD. She'll do fine for a while but something will trigger her and she'll have what I can only assume is an emotional flashback (I obviously don't know. I'm not in her head). When she does it becomes all about me. I am enemy number one. The problem is I honestly don't know to do and/or say. I've tried just remaining calm and saying that she might need sleep or food or to talk to someone but saying those things just makes her more angry. She will typically yell and say I'm gaslighting her. But if I actually engage in the conversation it becomes a game of ""guess how shitty I am"" and if I don't engage at all she says that I'm just ignoring her and ""emotionally abusing her."" What can I do? Does anyone else get this way during episodes. Like it doesn't matter what anyone says it's going to be the wrong thing? If so how do you get past it? Any help would be appreciated."
CPTSD,A person with so many diseases,"I am a person with so many diseases. I suffer everyday mentally, and physically. I know there are people who are suffering more than me.

I have a beautiful supportive partner who is always there for me, who is suffering for me. Still I feel alone. I see no hope. Every day suffering increases. Everyday I learn how to cope with it. Everyday is a whole new struggle for me.

I got to sleep everyday thinking how it could be worse than this. But my life proves me wrong. I am tired of adapting. I am tired of the surprises I get everyday. I want my life to be boring and simple now. No more surprises please. I donâ€™t remember when was the last time I didnâ€™t feel sick, I didnâ€™t feel pain, I didnâ€™t feel hopeless.

CPTSD,Ten years ago today,"Today marks ten years since the day I felt like I lost my innocence. January 6, 2014. Something clicked in that fucked up brain of mine that awakened me to all of the horrible things that were happening to me, mainly at school. I donâ€™t wanna say I took the redpill, but it was kinda like the Matrix. At home it was how my dad was failing me, how my mom was overcorrecting his mistakes but those paled in comparison to school.

In 2014 I spent most of the year just trying to survive. I had started middle school in fall 2013 and that environment was toxic and mean spirited unlike elementary school. I was one of the losers in my grade and most of my teachers and the administration were horrible people. Being neurodivergent back then was much more unforgivable to the eyes of education than it is today, even as a high achiever like myself. I pushed myself so hard and burnt out over shit that would never matter in my life. I had panic attacks almost daily. And it all started on that Monday that I woke up for school in the middle of the polar vortex and suddenly was awakened to the injustice happening all around me.

There had been warning signs before 2014, like in 2012, and my personality was such that this was bound to happen. The adults in my life donâ€™t know how horrible it got, and I donâ€™t think anybody couldâ€™ve imagined the darkness I endured being that strong, but it happened.

So much of my trauma responses are born from this period. Itâ€™s where the passive suicidal ideation really began, although there had been moments previously.

I just canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve been carrying this burden for ten years now, and Iâ€™m 20 turning 21 in August, so itâ€™s almost half my life. Thankfully it hasnâ€™t been as hard of a day as I was expecting it to be."
CPTSD,First time I've felt serious with someone in a relationship and I cannot believe he loves me even if he keeps reassuring me,I'm constantly scared that he's lying to himself and that he doesn't really love me and that he'll meet someone else who will make him realise that they're the actual person he wants to be with instead of me. I feel really sad about this. I've told him how I feel but it doesn't really help. He just reassures me and I can't seem to take it in. I feel like I will just lose him and I feel so unloved.
CPTSD,"It is okay that I can't be happy and can't take care of myself, right?","I am tired of blaming myself and seeing people blame me for not taking care of myself. I have been emotionally/mentally unwell for as long as I remember. I swear I tried everything I heard of in order to get better. I started reading psychology and self help books since I was in school to help me get rid of my anxiety and social phobia. I kept  trying for years but nothing improved. Then I joined a self help program which opened my eyes on many other problems I have, but that's all it did, it didn't improve my mental health. Then I started taking sessions with a therapist. I kept seeing her for two years. And I did everything she told me to do. But nothing changed. Then I joined a dbt group that lasted for months and I did everything that I was asked in the group until I completed it. But still, it didn't help me at all, in fact, I think it made my condition worse. Then I started seeing a new psychiatrist. That's when I was diagnosed with CPTSD. I tried different medications with her, some of which I kept taking for more than a year, but I didn't see the slightest effect on my mental health.

At this point I have tried CBT, DBT, IFS, EMDR and some other approaches as long as different medications. Did I gain anything? Just the realisation that I have way too many problems and that I live with awful parents.

And I know that's why I am not improving. I know I have to leave them and go NC but I not in a good state -financially- to do that. I am trying and  doing my best but I just live in a place where wages are really low while rent (with flatmates of course) is really high.

I keep praying that I will be able to leave and get better some day, but I just don't know if I will ever be able to do that.

But if I can't do that, or until I do that, is it okay that I just live miserably and can't do the basic self care? I can't eat well, I can't shower, I can't sleep well. I don't do anything well. 

I don't even know if I am able to do these basic things and I choose not to do them, or that I am truly uncapable of taking care of myself.

Sorry for the long post. If you reached this point then thank you."
CPTSD,Can't make myself eat because of a stupid joke,"My hubby knows most of what happened to me as a kid. He knows I have major issues around food, whether I deserve it/am worthy of it etc. This is a holdover not just from my biological parents, but my first and second foster families, too. I used to have to steal if I wanted food, and later in care I wasn't allowed certain foods (namely chocolate) because I didn't deserve it with the first family, and the second family made sure I knew I was getting the supermarket value versions where their kids are branded etc. 

It's taken a long time to train myself out of thinking that I don't deserve to eat. I'm overweight, and have been since my teens expect for a year when I went Keto and got very very physically fit. Like running races level fit. 

The pandemic triggered a binge eating disorder in me where I was buying and hiding food constantly, terrified I'd be found out but completely unable to stop myself. Hubby helped me through it, convinced me to go to therapy, and since the CBT for that I've been   fine for 2 years.

Got a tattoo yesterday to commemorate my marriage. Been together 7 years (my first relationship, I'm 33), lived together 6, bought a house together 4 years ago. We were supposed to get married 2020, but you can guess why that got delayed. My hubby got his tattoo first, 4 years ago, and it's taken this long for the artist to be available to do mine after the pandemic. Our baby is 7 months old and it was my first day without her, so we made it a special day (as much as being repeatedly stabbed by tiny little needles can be special) and I got a selection of my favourite treats to enjoy throughout the day as my blood sugars dipped.

It hurt so much that I actually lost my appetite, so we only shared one bag of chocolates.

I've been working on telling him how it feels to me when he eats all of or most of something I've bought for myself, and how important it is in my head that we each have certain foods that our ""mine"" and ""yours"" - I never touch his cakes, or croissants, etc and wouldn't dream of it unless he offered - as I've noticed I'm becoming snappy with him for drinking my coke or whatever. 

This morning, seeing all the unopened treats, he was like ""score! Chocolates!"" and I said to him that I would be upset if he ate more than half of anything. It was just to tell him that that is how I would feel. 

He just said ""well you've already had your tattoo, you don't deserve these too!"" And I know it was a joke. It really was, I could tell on his face it was a joke, and as soon as he saw my face he knew he messed up. I held it in for a little bit but broke down changing baby's nappy, and he tried to comfort me but all I have heard in my head since is that I don't deserve this food, I don't deserve these treats, I'm not good enough, I'm not worthy.

I have literally had to force myself to ask him if I can have what little I have managed to force down today. A banana. 2 mini sausage rolls (when I say mini I mean half the size of a little finger, they're tiny) and a slice of toast. I'm hungry. My stomach hurts. I'm on amoxicillin for a tooth infection, and I know I should be eating at least something.

But the little girl inside of me is convinced that I don't deserve it, and now I can't make myself have anything else. 

Just wanted to tell someone how I'm feeling. They're both asleep, and I'm looking at yet another night where I won't be able to turn my stupid brain off long enough to sleep myself."

One incident when she tried to go after him with a knife, I got in her way trying to prevent her from chasing after him, she held the knife above my head and acted like she was gonna stab me, I remember I slightly ducked down. One night they got into another argument, she got a wooden board with long nails, and held it up like she was gonna hurt him with it, and told me to leave the room so she can do it, then I remember my father telling me not to leave the room, I just stood there crying and I didnâ€™t know what to do in that moment, she had blood all over her mouth, and I was scared. As my brother got older, he got into drugs and would get violent towards my mom and tried to kill her many times, involving him slitting his wrists right infront of me because he was full of rage from coming off meth. His aggressive screaming is something I would never forget and sometimes I replay it in my head. Many times when my parents got into it, as a little girl, I felt as if I overreacted to the situation, like going outside screaming for help and crying for the neighbors to hear and it never worked. I would scream so loud trying to stop it and it never worked, next day my voice would be strained. It happened many times. Iâ€™m still like that to this day as an adult, I have this exaggerating reaction when they get physical with eachother even though itâ€™s not as bad as it was in the past, I will get super shaky and start crying out loud for someone to hear me."
CPTSD,Does anyone have a flat affect as a result of emotional abuse and neglect?,Flat affect means you don't express emotions on your face or you express little emotion. I don't know if it's because of c-ptsd or autism. Or both? I just wanted to see what's normal and what's not. My family generally did not express emotions on their face so it could be that too.
CPTSD,I think my dad is hitting my cat,"She didn't flinch when we got her, now she does. And he yells at her a lot. He was always the sober ""stable"" parent so I find it hard to accept. But the older I've gotten the worse he treats me. Now I feel totally alone except for my cat. Who I can't even protect. I'm feeling deep pain in my heart right now, just needed to get this off my chest."
CPTSD,"I'm having an issue I think is related to trauma, anyone else have this? Probably should flag for sexual trauma, but nothing graphic.","So, I have a decent sex drive, however, I shut down when sex comes up. I dissociate whenever I talk about it. I still like sex, but can't talk about it much at all. My husband loves talking about it and I hate that I have this block. My brain is perfectly vivid in its imagination, but it's like I have a mute button.

I have experienced some sexual assault in the past - nothing super extreme though. It doesn't seem like it should be playing into it, but brains are weird and finicky.

Anyone else have this who hasn't had extreme assaults in this way?"
CPTSD,Can any Christians relate?,"First off, I'm Christian. If there are any Christians on here, I was wondering if y'all can relate to this? Sometimes, when I get caught up in a traumatic event, my brain tries to ""fix it"" in a sinful way. For example, I would remember when someone in high school would humiliate me repeatedly, and then my brain would imagine me breaking something over his head, and it gets worse from there. I don't want this to happen most of the time, but during an episode I feel like the most evil and heartless person. I logically know it's sinful, but it feels almost impossible to control myself. I might even think to myself, ""I don't care if it's a sin."" How awful is that!? Is this a spiritual problem too, or just a mental problem?"
CPTSD,Money Difficulties,"Hey Everyone!

I was diagnosed with CPTSD in the last half of last year. I was wondering if having difficulties around money is normal, but in a ""I can't spend it"" type of way? I always hear that being bad with money and spending it all is a symptom, but I have the exact opposite issue. I have a lot of money saved up but find it VERY difficult to spend any of it unless it's a necessity (food, shelter, etc).

&#x200B;

Any help is appreciated! Thank you!"
CPTSD,All I wanted was somebody to care,Why didn't anyone care about me? I think of my inner child and all the pain she went through by her caretakers yet no one noticed. Why didn't anyone save me? Even as an adult nobody cares. All I long for is love and affection yet I get jealousy and rejection. Nobody cares about me and this is why I'm going to kill myself soon. I'm so tired of this.
CPTSD,Struggling with feeling lethargic in my home country - does anyone else relate?,"Hi everyone,  
I've been struggling with some feelings lately and wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone else has experienced something similar. I grew up in a country different from my parents' origin and had a tumultuous childhood, with a parent with anger management issues and bullying at school. I believe my CPTSD stems from these early life experiences.  
Here's what's been on my mind: whenever I'm in my home country, where I spent a significant part of my childhood, I feel incredibly lethargic and disconnected. I lack motivation and often feel lonely and negative, despite recognizing that there are great communities around. It's like a dark cloud over me, and I spend my days inside bored, waiting for them to be over. 

However, when I travel to other countries, it's like a switch flips. I suddenly feel motivated, alive, and eager to connect with people and my surroundings. I am full of energy and it's like I realize life can be fun. It's a stark contrast that's become more and more pronounced. I haven't pinpointed what exactly about my home country triggers this shift in me.  
Does anyone else feel this sense of boredom and disconnection in their home country or a place they've spent a lot of time in? How do you cope with these feelings? I'm interested in hearing your experiences and any insights you might have. I hope that hearing from others who understand might shed some light on how to feel more comfortable in my home country.  
Thank you for reading and for any thoughts you share."
CPTSD,Therapist boundaries,"Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for maybe 6 months, heâ€™s a good price as I canâ€™t afford an expensive one and he did say he specialised in trauma. 

Anyways thereâ€™s a few things heâ€™s done that I feel are questionable- texting me late at night, today he text me â€œdo you still hate me??? Lolâ€ this was referring to our last session where I felt annoyed when he challenged me on something and it was triggering for me, instead of focusing on why I felt annoyed and exploring that he had said during the session â€œdo you hate me nowâ€ 

He has offered me some free sessions saying I can pay him back when I become super successful and he also reassures me a lot that I am a good person etc etc. 

Itâ€™s just not what I expected out of therapy. Iâ€™m starting to feel like I owe him something, and that I have to please him in a way which is making me feel so uncomfortable. 

I did tell him originally that it made me feel uncomfortable when he text me late at night and asking me how I was after sessions then if I didnâ€™t reply asking if I still wanted my next session, he said he wouldnâ€™t do it anymore but then heâ€™s now doing it again."
CPTSD,Someone reached out to my little brother and I on Facebook to say that her 13 y.o. daughter's phone was stolen and was pinging at my childhood address where my dad lives. He's known for being inappropriate with teenage girls. I don't think it was a scam.,"It seemed legit. She wasn't asking for money- just the phone returned. 

I woke up to a message from a woman saying their teenage daughter's phone was stolen. It was pinging at my childhood address the woman used a background check website to find my name associated with the address.

I haven't spoken to him in a decade. I let her know that. I gave her some background info (that he's a gun owner and a known pedo). She then mentioned that she spoke to him on the phone and ""he seemed a bit strange- he asked a lot about my kids."" I advised her to block his number and block him on socials.

I don't know if she's going to follow up with the police, etc. But it would absolutely not surprise me if he did steal a teenage girl's phone.

I fucking hate him."
CPTSD,Thank you,"Iâ€™m newish to Reddit and discovered this group today; been scrolling through nonstop and joined.
I was diagnosed with PTSD (eventually CPTSD) two years ago after unlocking childhood trauma. Iâ€™ve been working through intense trauma therapy and itâ€™s been incredibly lonely â€” some in my life understand mental illness but even then, CPTSD is so foreign to them. 
I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone here. Iâ€™ve never felt so seen and connected to so many, Iâ€™ve been tearing up going through posts as I connect with each and every one. I didnâ€™t realize how isolated I felt until today, so thank you â¤ï¸
To anyone having difficulties coping or just surviving, know that youâ€™re not alone and that just being alive is enough: I donâ€™t know you, but I love you."
CPTSD,Just me?,"Is anyone else still in a relationship with the person who is part of the reason why you were diagnosed with CPTSD? 

I am and daily he gets mad at me for how I react to things but HE is why Iâ€™m like this.  Sir, you created this."
CPTSD,how do you deal with the constant need for reassurance from your partner even though you logically know youâ€™re good enough and they like you?,"I (F,21) tarted dating this guy (M,24) a while ago and weâ€™ve been seeing each other for few weeks now and itâ€™s going well. Heâ€™s been super sweet to me and accommodative. Hasnâ€™t love bombed me and thereâ€™s vulnerability when itâ€™s required.

However I canâ€™t help but feel that heâ€™s going to leave me, heâ€™s not as interested anymore, itâ€™s all a facade and a joke, Iâ€™m going to be a big clown by the end of this, Iâ€™m not good enough/smart enough for him, heâ€™s such a catch and Iâ€™m basically useless so how did I end up with him? 

Itâ€™s crazy how often these thoughts cross my mind and despite knowing that theyâ€™re irrational I canâ€™t help but believe them at times. He has reassured me multiple times but even then I think itâ€™s me who canâ€™t deal with having just a nice person around and Iâ€™m like letâ€™s push him away and leave him before he leaves me. Itâ€™s honestly exhausting. I donâ€™t know how to deal with it and stop hyperfixating on everything wrong with our relationship based on random stuff."
CPTSD,What would your parents life be like if you weren't born?,"I often think to myself that I am always destroying everything and to be near me means worst time ever, but reading the book ""Children of emotionally immature parents"" I just thought to myself: what if I weren't ever born? Would they be happier without me? 

For example, in my case my grandmother nudged my mom to give birth to me instead of abortion because of religion, and then my mother was ruined by the fact she had to raise me alone while in presence of my immature grandma who always made herself the victim. So I think in the end it would've been the same for them or worse if they hadn't such a toy as me to play with, spend their money and time on me to ""receive my love"", but maybe it would've been better for my mother if she wouldn't submit to just accepting my grandmother's wishes to raise someone instead of living her own life. After all, even with my uncle being 50+ years old, she still tried to care about him and make him a little child. He is still addicted to alcohol and does nothing, while everyone treat him as lazy ass, and its sad

How about you? What would happen to your parents if you weren't born?"
CPTSD,This realization might be the worst part,"My mother/abuser is a prolific liar, her story is always changing, and I honestly don't know what the motivation behind her actions was. 

  
However, I know beyond any reasonable doubt that she either hates me with a level of passion that is just hard to describe without going into a lot detail, telling some long stories or she is so indifferent toward me that she is willing to let me suffer the worst fate imaginable rather than face some far lesser degree of discomfort herself.  


I can move on from the memories of the physical pain, the times she nearly killed me or got me killed, etc. etc. etc. but just knowing that my mother  feels that way about me is something I can't seem to move on from. What makes it worse is, when I was little, most of the time, she seemed very loving."
CPTSD,"Everytime I try to pick up the pieces, something happens to set me back.","Went through an awful painful breakup, was finally feeling a bit better and then SURVIVED AN ARMED ROBBERY, was finally feeling better about that, telling myself it is just money (and what little sense of security I had). Then I got to my new location and my life has gone even more downhill (terrifying life changing experiences). I'm trying so hard to be positive but I feel like I'm doomed. Then I fall back into the depression and reckless hole. I feel awful. It's hard to feel positive when I'm always worried about something coming across the corner. Does anyone else feel like this? I'm trying to practice radical acceptance but idk. I'm suffering."
CPTSD,How to stop attacking myself during off days,"I very recently started meditation and was finding it was helping me stay present and feel calm throughout the day and more able to feel positve and communicate with people as myself. I have just started back at work after some time off, and had one great day where I felt in control and that if anything came up I could just breathe and calm myself back down. 

At the start of the second work day i felt really tense and distracted and tried to calm myself down using 'home base' - breathing and checking in with myself -  but when this repeatedly didnt work throughout the day I kinda started panicking and attacking myself for it and making myself feel worse.

I wondered if anyone had any good techniques for stopping this spiral happening. I am really hard on myself and whenever something I thought was helping temporarily isnt happening properly it always feels like regression which makes me feel panicked and I just continually mentally beat myself up and tell myself everyone thinks im strange because im not talking and that i'll never achieve the things i want because i cant even exist calmly in the world."
CPTSD,Strange relationship with socializing after truama,"After leaving my last abusive relationship a little over a year ago now, something has happened to my ability to socialize interpersonally. See, in a public forum/setting where I am interacting with multiple people at a time, I do great, I can interact freely and express myself fully. But when it comes to direct messages or one on one conversations, I'm just.. not the same. 

I feel stumbly and awkward, i keep it very short and instinctively just say and contribute enough to be sure they are comfortable, but its often not a real conversation. I dont feel right, some part of me sees him everywhere in these conversations, even when its obviously not the case.
""its just a matter of time that theyll hate you too"" that part of me says.

I can tell im afraid. Terrified even. The thought of dissapointing people interpersonally just tears me apart, im afraid of not being enough. I dont want to be hurt again, i dont want to be coerced again, i dont want to feel like that again, months of someone just playing with your emotions and fears on purpose, just to get you to conform. 

But when its multiple people around, im suddenly fine. Like this glow of community obscures the voice and i can interact normally. Its a little hard to explain, especially since its often the other way around from what i see in people, but in my case, no. Ive avoided so many social opportunities, dms of people who genuinely have a reason to like and value me enough to interact with me personally and consider me a freind, but i just.. cant without forcing myself to. 

So i guess i wanted to know the communities thoughts and if you go through this too. I want to learn how to move on from my pain and enjoy what i used to. One on one conversations can be very beautiful and deep in a way that public ones dont often match."
CPTSD,Iâ€™m afraid filial responsibility laws will make me financially responsible for my aging parents.,"Iâ€™m a millennial and the eldest daughter among my three siblings. My parents fucked all three of us over emotionally and financially. 

We were neglected and abused in more ways than one, but never to the point where CPS was called. I donâ€™t think I realized just how bad it was until I was in college and the years following. As my resentment has grown, our relationship has become more estranged. I still make somewhat of an effort to keep in touch and see them on holidays, but weâ€™re distant. 

I keep seeing posts about filial responsibility laws and how you can be financially responsible for your parentsâ€™ medical bills and care as they age, and even the thought makes me FURIOUS. Iâ€™m in a state that does have filial responsibility laws (NC). My dad will probably be fine, but my mom has become addicted to being in debt and has no retirement savings. I graduated college with tens of thousands of dollars in debt because they never saved a penny for me (despite being able to afford it) and then surprised me with that information 1 week before I went to college. 

I was riddled with anxiety for years and took on second jobs to stay on afloat financially because of their lack of caring for me. Iâ€™ve worked so hard to pay off my loans and actually ended up creating a comfortable (but not rich) life for myself. Yet I will have to pay for my deadbeat momâ€™s expensive care as she ages?! How is that fair??"

CPTSD,Caught with prescription Marijuana by conservative aunty In a foreign country,"I'm not sure if this is the right group to post this but I (29f) have severe anxiety and PTSD, therefore I'm prescribed medical Marijuana for the tremors and to help me function. My body has reacted way better to this than traditional prescription meds, which I'm no longer on (gave me SI). Anyways, I'm staying at my aunties house in a foreign county. She is uber religious and conservative. Our home country is currently at war and everyone is strung out (rightfully so) because our families are in danger. After an extremely stressful conversation around 5 am  time, after my auntie was asleep, I snuck out into the courtyard to smoke a J, totally forgetting that the housekeeper was cleaning inside. Anyways, I suspect she told my aunty who came barreling outside and confronted me. Before she'd come out I snuffed my j so she didn't actually catch me in the act. I immediately denied it but the stench was obvious. She doesn't believe in mental health let alone cannabis for tremors and PTSD. I vehemently denied it because I genuinely feared for my safety. I've been out of the house all day but sunset is approaching and I have no idea what to do. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? And yes I recognize that it was incredibly idiotic to do this. I've been having panic attacks all day. I'm terrified she will tell the rest of my family. I can't stop crying. She was dead asleep before I left the room. FML."
CPTSD,Truth tellers,"EDIT- Please donâ€™t DM me here if I donâ€™t know you, especially if you have a blank profile, asking me if I â€œwant to get my anger out?â€ Go away. 

So many of us tell/told the truth about the people who hurt us, who destroyed our nervous systems, who betrayed our trust, who mocked us for how we felt, for calling out bad behavior, and Iâ€™m so beyond words right now. Iâ€™m tired of it. 

Iâ€™m tired of being the one whoâ€™s been punished my whole f**cking life for being different, for feeling too much, for not coping well because of the abuse. 

Iâ€™m really angry that I never learned how to invite healthy relationships into my life. Just fully trusting whoever and assuming that they would be kind and good, only to find out that theyâ€™re no different than anyone else. 

Iâ€™m tired. This feels so unfair. And so many of us have some type of n/arc in our lives and thereâ€™s literally almost no support for that, except for peer support. 

This is lonely. People think that Iâ€™m a mess and a wreck. I try though. So much therapy in my life, trying. Journaling, mindfulness all of it.

I have physical illness due to the stress Iâ€™ve had for most of my life, Iâ€™m exhausted mostly too exhausted to function. 

People donâ€™t have to lay a finger on you to destroy you. Iâ€™m really sad right now and Iâ€™m so tired of it. I am hurt on behalf of the people here and the people who are hurting everywhere and seen as the weirdos or black sheep or â€œcrazyâ€. Iâ€™m really over it."

Especially my phone is a killer distraction. When I finally ""wake up"" I suddenly remember I actually really did want to do things.

CPTSD,"How do I ""fix"" relationship after bad cyclical PTSD dissasociation w/ PMDD","I would mark this under ""rant/vent"" but I'd like these burning questions answered more than anything.

If you dont wanna read so much, skip to ""TLDR"" and read from there, thank you.

Backstory- I have medical PTSD. I also have PMDD and Endometriosis. My medical trauma relates to gynecology so my PMDD feels predictable and fake to me. Its unreal how I know what is going to happen and I still cant stop myself. Basically the week before my excruciatingly painful periods I fully disconnect from reality. I dont shut down, but instead I find myself extremely confused, unable to count, recall details, understand basic situational concepts like who is in a groupchat... and worst of all tripling-down on takes I dont even believe in. 

What happened this time- I had a nice night set out for me and my partner, Videogames followed by him coming over for dinner and a movie. Earlier in the night we were ""Five-stacking"" (aka playing with a full 5 people who were in a call together, so no random matchmaking was involved) I thought it was 4 of us for some reason and I completely shit on our 5th who did literally nothing wrong (I was just pissed I was doing bad). When I realized it was my partner's friend and not a random player in our lobby my heart fucking shatteted. I cant imagine how my partner's friend felt though, I'm sure not great. My severe confusion left me beyond embarassed. I wanted to run away and hide. 
Later in the night, the topic of steven hawking was brought up after discussing what Epstein's flight logs were (this triggered me for sure) while playing CS2 (a videogame) with my partner and their friends. I claimed I never liked Steven Hawking (which I dont really care for him, its true, but I also dont trust most billionare men). When I said this my partnered claimed ""you just made that up, you always think everyone is bad vibes..."" etc. They do this often, saying I stretch the truth but really I'm recalling details wrong and get very frustrated about it. Who doesnt genuinely hyperbolize sometimes too? Its not a crime. But, obviously this triggered me further. I felt attacked in a weird way and I basically said ""Being paralised and a man isnt that bad, try being a woman. Cant walk? Big woop."" My partner said ""okay you're having one of your episodes."" which didnt make me feel any better and I think they could have said it better. My partner's friends were clearly not happy, one of them fully removed their headset. 

When I did question myself and go... do I really believe this shit? No of course I dont, it was small truths (like yea eat the rich, just because you're in a wheelchair doesnt mean you arent still a slimey man, etc.) which I must say, while they are more what I mean ate still things I hyperfixated on that night because of my own frustration with sufferering an invisible disease, getting no recognition for it, having a ptsd diagnosis come out of trying to treat it, it being under-researched and unrecognized, the list bloody goes on. But anyways, the way my thoughts came out were basically those little truths covered by huge vague dissasociative generalized statements that misconveyed my true feelings and could have easily turned anyone in a room away from thinking I had even a semblance of empathy or maturity.

And you ask yourself maybe, why not just stfu? I felt like I was forced to talk, like someone had a knife at my back. But yea, shen we logged off videogames I realized what day it was... PMDD, oh I cant have a normal life. I felt worse, I disasociated more, I felt crazy. I didnt want anybody to forgive me, was it the real me? I'm useless, I'm losing my life to this disease and the damage its seaped into my life. Thoughts you may or may not have had yourself before? Idk


TLDR-
I said ableist shit I didnt believe in generalized statements in front of my partner and his friends because I disasociated. I have PMDD and PTSD so it is very cyclical and although I know it will happen, the more I fight the worse it gets. Anyways, I fucked up. I said morally unacceptable statements that I didnt belive laced with small morally acceptable truths that I do hold- didnt even feel like me saying it...
But then How do I move on now? If its every month... how do I applogize over and over?

Now that you have context, I'm literally chronically ill and I try to advocate for chronically ill people, disabled people, etc. and I truly hate our society's inability to accomidate and instead pave roads on the crushed people's lives under this late-stage ableist capitalism hellscape.

MY RELATIONSHIP-
My partner came over and they confronted me about it, I was still having an episode so I said ""so what?"" ""yea, I think being in a wheelchair would be better than being a woman, so what?"" They were astonished and said ""wow, you're a bad person."" bluntly. I said ""how?"" They then sat down on the couch and didnt say a word. I didnt talk to my partner for 3 hours until as they left when I mustered up the audacity and said ""I told you I wasnt going to be fun to be around."" which is true, I say this in refference to my PMDD because I dont want to use disasociation as an excuse (its my choice to lose it basically, and I feel deep shame in that which comes with my PTSD). they didnt say anything, hugged me and then they left.
On their way back home, I blocked their contacts, deleted it, unplugged my computer, uninstalled discord, etc. etc. Basically I just blamed myself, I feel like I didnt and dont deserve to be forgiven at all. I am a bad person, it would be easier to rot in bed than to burden others with my neurological abnormalities. And yea, I mulled in over all night since I havent been sleeping for more than 3 hours and only during the day for the past week. I think I've come down a little, but I'm writting this reddit post and my PMDD time-frame is not over, so obviously i'm still mixed up like a smoothie but I can see why my actions and words were literal cartoon villain trash.

What do I do?

My thought process/questions-
Do I wait for my partner to respond? Do I deserve forgiveness? I feel that if I say ""i'm sorry"" then great, but PTSD and PMDD and Endo/Adenomyosis dont just go away and since its cyclical I feel I'll just do it again but in a different flavour. Do I'm not going to give some fake apology out so I can keep living like I'm a good person. I want to go to them and express what is happening, the conclusions I've drawn, the insane night I've had like I wasnt even in my own body. But what do I tell their friends? What if its not over yet? I'm afraid above all else that I'll be given forgiveness I do not deserve, repedetively breaking relationship's trust. Its like doing damage control after a child threw a tantrum in a shop and broke something expensive. Exhausting and pointless.

Has anyone struggled like this? How do you repair relationships, what language can I even use to express these PTSD episodes in a way that isnt just a big fat excuse? I have a constant and convenient out for terrible behavior is how I feel, and I didnt trust myself that I was a good person before but after what my partner said... its difficult to think anything but ""scum"" about myself. I mean I cant just apologize though right? Please someone read all this soon and reply. I miss my life. I miss the me I used to be before PTSD took over."
CPTSD,development trauma / complex trauma?,"van der kolk suggested splitting up ptsd and make 3 diagnosis out of it

**simple ptsd** (trauma can be framed into a certain time and place, like war experiences)

**complex ptsd** (this goes on for a prolonged time and multiple offenses, like prisoner of war or human trafficing victims)

**developmental trauma disorder** (childhood abuse/neglect/..)

CPTSD,Chronic-Fatigue,"This may not be the right place to post this, but I think it could directly relate to the chronic, ongoing stress I've experienced throughout my life.

I'm so indescribably exhausted all the time that it's starting to become physically painful and disrupt aspects of my life, and especially taking an immense toll on my mental health. I'm on many supplements; Multivitamins, 50,000IU of Vit. D weekly, and B12 daily. I exercise, eat healthy, get at least 7-8 hours of sleep at night, and I am still sluggish and exhausted every damn day. I also had EBV as a child, so I know that can be a cause for chronic-fatigue even years after having the virus.

I'm at a point in my life now where, for the first time in a *long* *long* time, I have no imminent chaos surrounding me, and I'm not constantly on edge. I believe my nervous system is somewhat calm, and I feel like my body is trying to process and make up for the years. I'm a firm believer in adrenal fatigue, but I feel like my lifestyle should already curb the affects of that (?). Idk, can anyone else relate/offer some advice? Thanks <3

CPTSD,Who do you talk with? How?,"I feel like I am in drowning at the moment: a family member just passed away and so much muck from the past has resurfaced.  I feel it is drowning me, I don't know how to relate to what I feel, what I remember, what I know, (these three are not always the same either).  My depression is spiralling. I don't have an appointment with a therapist until feb.   
I have a friend I used to talk with, but the contact is so one-sided that I have withdrawn; I don't want to be a burden, I don't feel like I matter to them as it is always me making the first type of contact, I  literally get out of bed to care for my kids and return to bed as soon as I am able. 

I don't know how to snap out of this. I feel like i need someone I can talk with, but I am not able to carry the whole conversation. My S.O says little when i talk, i know he tries to listen to take in what i say, but without responses the conversation feels futile, i might as well talk to a wall or to myself.

I increasingly feel like disappearing is the best option for the people around me. I feel like a burden to my friend because I feel like a nag because I always have to make the contact. I feel like a burden because I am not pulling my weight at the moment at work. I feel I am failing as a parent.  I feel I am failing as a partner because i have no more energy left, and I feel like I am losing my other friends because i struggle to connect with the topics that occupies them - it is like I live on my own little planet.

CPTSD,Trauma bonding and recovery,"Hi, all, I know that trauma bonding is usually used to talk about romantic relations but I'm trying to process some of the patterns I've followed in the past and it feels like some of them are trauma bonding. I was wondering if anyone else has felt the same and how they got out of it.  
  
I've always felt like there is a curse hanging over me, that no matter what I do and where I go the toxicity, misery and pain from my family will follow me around and will make me obviously different to others. That it will be something I can't even overcome because my family is still there, still full of the toxic abusive patterns and still full or the decay, despair and pain that they've inflicted on each other and on me. This feeling has led me, a few times, when I've wanted to uproot my life and start a new, but when something horrible happened back home and they tried to rope me in, that I have felt that I can't escape and should therefore return there. I felt ashamed by the things happening at home and by the ugliness and intensity of my emotions and I felt that I didn't belong among people who are ""normal"" and should go back to the place where these emotions make sense.  
  
This kind of feels like a trauma bond, right? I am wrestling with the realisation that I might have sabotaged my life multiple times this way and not taken the leap out of the family and into healing. If anyone has been caught in this dynamic - how did you get out and how did you deal with the grief and guilt of looking back and seeing a pattern that kept you inside the trauma for longer than it should have?"
CPTSD,Am I Overreacting by Choosing to go no Contact? (Mention of Physical (and Sexual?) Assault),"Hi this is a burner I accidentally made a while ago, cause I'm worried someone in my family could find my main. And I'm not sure I have cptsd, but this was the only place I could think to ask. But for context, I do have autism, bpd, depression, dissassociative disorder, and have flashbacks to traumatic events.

But around a year ago I started to remember a relationship I didn't remember having. Though for 2 years before felt sad, longing, and grief for one I didn't have either. Then I started to fully remember it, that the reason I barely remember my time at college is cause I completely blocked out the memory of this person. I am very private and don't really tell my family much usually, so I had kept her a secret from them. I was also worried they'd be homophobic to her (proudly pan). But I finally decided to tell them, cause I don't have anyone else anymore. They listened and have tried to be supportive, even though for a while they were pressuring me to contact her family, despite the fact they abused her. 

A little after that, I started to see things during my random panic attacks, like wrists reaching down towards my throat and I could feel them. But I didn't mention it cause I thought it was fake since that's all I had. But now I think about it all the time, randomly flashing back to it and getting terrified, seemingly again. I constantly feel the hands on my throat. And have started to remember the feeling of hair brushing my face, blurring yellow-orange lights in the dark, and sometimes something wrapped around ""me"". The panic attacks have gotten worse and culminated in me seeing some random girl with tanned skin, brown hair, and a thin  face and freezing with my heartbeat bursting out of my chest.

So I finally told my brother about it, but he just said. ""You don't remember much, are you sure it wasn't a dream? I've made up whole people in my dreams before, so."" And then found out my whole family thinks I made up at least part of my girlfriend and/or am purposely withholding info. Because I've said I misrembered something or gotten confused on exact timeline or remembered new info later. And he said ""without more I don't know what you want me to do. Its hard to feel sympathy when we don't know anything."" And went on with his day like I hadn't just told him I  have panic attacks and memories of being assaulted 

So I've decided to finally finish school with their government benefits I can receive and be covered for a surgery in a year. Then leave cause I can't believe they think I'm some sort of attention seeking shit who needs constant sympathy. Especially after a lifetime of emotional neglect, repression, and invalidating.

Tldr; my family doesn't believe my repressed memories of grief and assault. That I'm looking for attention or making it up. So I'm gonna use them for their insurance and scholarships then leave and never talk to them again."
CPTSD,"Was I too sensitive about BIL's ""teaching moment""?","After my partner died, the basically BIL came over to get my partner's vinyl records, which I offered to him.  He brought along his ex-wife without warning me in advance.  I had not seen her for a long time, and she had gained weight. I did not recognize her, and asked him who it was. He told me, and said that gaining weight was normal as one gets older. Am I being too sensitive, or was that actually kind of manipulative and aggressive? I didn't say: My God, she's fat! I also didn't ask it in front of her. He was extremely gaslighty and dishonest about many other things."
CPTSD,Im sabotaging my own success due to my emotional attachment to my abusive mother.,"Ive been severely emotionally abused my whole life by my mother. The last years I've been working on myself, i now have the conscious belief that my mother is abusive. And i didn't deserve any of it. The beliefs she implanted in me were indeed not true. 
But for some reason despite my potential that i was diving into in the last year and all the opportunities that are facing me, im still not taking the ride. 
I often dream about my attachment to her and how im sabotaging myself bc of her, idk maybe my unconscious is sending those dreams ? 
I don't feel that attachment to her i feel like i let go. But for some reasons it seems like it's still there. 
But it's just hard idk how to get over this. 
I can go in details if anyone has any questions.
Note: i still live with her. And if i let go of this sabotaging i can change my life upside down to the better. "

CPTSD,Why is this sub so much diggers than other mental health subs (especially r/bipolar)?,"I'm an active member in r/bipolar and I've noticed that if I say the same thing here than I do there, u get massive downvotes here and up votes there. Why can't we just be able to tell people what they need to hear and not just what they want to hear? I've been in trauma therapy for 4 years and being coddled is not the way to heal from trauma. We can be a safe space without being a space where nobody is told that they're being unreasonable, unrealistic, offensive, or are overreacting. 

None of us deserved to go through traumatic experiences, but we are still responsible for our actions and how we interact in the real world, so why can't we just stop with the hypersensitivity at any point? 

For example, this girl went off her meds, went off on her mom during the holidays, and felt like a bad daughter. Myself and others straight up told her that she *was* a bad daughter by choosing to go off of her medication, knowing what that would do to her and knowing how it would likely impact her mom. Like, *that* is the sort of accountability I want to see on this sub. We need to stop this infantilization of everyone on here and make people be responsible for their shit. 

I mean, really, is that too much to ask for? Is it?"
CPTSD,What do you do whenâ€¦,"I met a group of friends I havenâ€™t seen in awhile last night. For whatever reason I reverted to older ways and did things like focus on one or two people instead of my friend, the host. Might have been so out of it I didnâ€™t hear when he or other people were talking or saying my name to get my attention (this happens often actually) and even found myself staring at certain people. This is not my norm but was before I started healing triggers and trauma. My friend didnâ€™t even get up to say goodbye when I left like he usually does.  
I feel everyone knew I was ignoring him (except me.. ) and I feel embarrassed and guilty.

I sent him an impulsive text this morning saying oh I am having hearing trouble but clearly didnâ€™t think it through because that doesnâ€™t negate that I ignored him for whatever subconscious reason.

I have done EFT, talked to child and critic. Acknowledge Iâ€™m safe in this moment. Sat with the discomfort that this is life, I make mistakes. I have to forgive myself. Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s not the END of the world like it would have been earlier in my healing journey. Realized I should probably give him space and accept this is how it is and I hurt him. just lost so many people in the past and its disheartening and will I have to give everyone in my life 2 months space everytime I get triggered and act from a child place?

Heâ€™s not close enough and heâ€™s a guy and Iâ€™m a girl to say oh did I hurt you in anyway. I thought about it but I think he would be weirded out if I said that.

I wonder if I missed anything, anything I can do. When I get triggered or dissociate I also donâ€™t have an accurate sense of reality so maybe someone can help.  It would normally feel like the end of the world and Iâ€™m dying as from cptsd with parents. But Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m just all these emotions from the disaapointment and I hope someone can offer a perspective maybe or even bettter a way to fix it?   (Thatâ€™s my child talking I know).. or is it?

Do need to accept I made a mistake and maybe heal more before big group outtings too? Should I apologize. Whatâ€™s my excuse. Iâ€™m tired?  Apologize without an excuse?  Bc itâ€™s like sorry my child  wasnâ€™t interested in you and other people instead and for ignoring you even tho I didnâ€™t intend to becuawe I have severe trauma. Or just sorry I was off last night ? 

Any help and insights are appreciated."
CPTSD,Was this a Flashback?,"Apologies if I donâ€™t describe this very wellâ€¦Thanks to anyone who takes time to read or respondâ€¦ feeling very fragile, dissociated and confused right now.  

Last night I had what would be outwardly observed as a kind of fit - body flailing about - bashing against the floor and walls - arms beating body parts - scratching self - slamming head against floor - whole body jerking. Physically fighting with myself. Erratic and sudden movements. 

Inside I felt like I was being physically  attacked by my abuser - that he was on me - attacking me - moving my body in such ways and I was trying to get him off of me. In words I was screaming simulataneously  I need to die and begging him to go away and leave me alone. I felt like he was physically attached to me. Like I was physically re-enacting the physical violence/rape experience and reacting to it in the now - physically but with myself??? 
 
Has anyone experienced this kind of flashback behavior experience before? Or is this not a flashback at all and something else?

CPTSD,"guilt for no longer being a protector, and tangent about an ex-friend","i get triggered a lot by a younger ex-friend who i hate, and my younger sibling whoâ€™s in middle school and suffered thru a shit ton of abuse and neglect and grew up similarly to how i did.

i used to want to save and protect them when i was younger cuz i didnâ€™t want anyone else to suffer like how i did. but i couldnâ€™t do it anymore. i was sacrificing myself and i had no control over my life.

for my own sanity it took me a long time to let my siblings go and focus on myself instead. it feels soul crushing and like iâ€™m a perpetrator of abuse. and i feel like the same piece of shit like my mom is.

i feel disgusted that i can sort of understand why my mom the way she is now. except it was never my duty to be my siblingsâ€™ parent or protector, it was her duty. yet i feel disgusting and like a traitor. sick to my skin. i canâ€™t do anything about it or her. i despise her as a person.

i sort of feel like this about my ex-friend too. but i have to put a boundary. iâ€™m okay if my sibling lashes out at me a bit bc i know our circumstance and, iâ€™ll try to fix our broken family the best i can.

when my friend treats me like shit, they can go fuck themselves and figure it out themself, iâ€™m not their mommy. 

i used to want to believe in found family so badly, but that just gave me the same problems, and just gave my friend permission to be a fucking shit to me. why would i choose a family that treats me like shit again?? itâ€™s stupid. if iâ€™m going to put up with brats, iâ€™ll only allow my siblings to. i donâ€™t have the energy for that childish shit

i kind of miss deep friendships where weâ€™re like a family. but i have too many other problems to deal with. and family is complicated. makes me wish i were an only child like or only had 1 sibling like they did. stupid lucky bastards. they wouldnâ€™t understand one bit

iâ€™m just feeling bitter and got way off topic. idk anymore if leaving them was even a good idea. maybe they were shit and i just need better friends.. they certainly made me feel like it and let me know"

CPTSD,Does it ever get better,"I am truly so tired of trying to get better and fight for myself. I am on medication, have a psychiatrist. I have been in therapy for many years and now finally have a good trauma therapist and Iâ€™m doing emdr with her. I feel like there is no relief, even working through things the way Iâ€™m supposed to be is just making things worse.

CPTSD,"The more I heal, the more I recover, the more lonely I feel.","I don't know what life would be like without trauma, I imagine my problems would be different, the scale would be smaller, and there would be more space for if not joy, at least mundane normalcy. I am sure that the isolation, the loneliness, if it was there, I wouldn't be as extreme as it is. 

I feel lonely, but I feel it most when I'm healing, recovering, and my life is going well. I'm peaceful, I'm generally happy each day, life should be great. But healing feels like it has dramatically diminishing returns for me when it's in the absence of meaningful connections. 

It feels like no matter how much I improve my circumstances, my life, my health, my finances, anything. It just, it sucks to be lonely. The most awful, crippling, horrible and painful aspect is that the person who abused me, that I suffered CSA due to, is the only person I've ever had a 'meaningful connection' with. I'm sure it's warped my perspective terribly, and it always messes with my head. The lonelier I get, even getting close to two decades away from it, it makes me miss them. And that honestly breaks me down more than just about anything else can. Because they carelessly and selfishly broke me as a child, and I've spent my entire life putting myself back together."
CPTSD,Just another Crappy Childhood Fairy post,"Edit: Whoa I didn't expect this to blow up! Sorry for the late response, I had a closing shift yesterday then an opening shift today so I'm just getting the chance to read your responses now. Thank you everyone who read my post, I appreciate all of you.

I used to watch her years ago and stopped but couldn't remember why. Anyway I was in a rough place in November and started binge-watching her videos to try to get myself back on track.

At first it was helpful and gave me the courage to leave a friendship that was unhealthy for me. But there were things AR said that gave me pause. Firstly she seemed very judgemental at times. I think I was watching a video about attachment issues and she was saying that it's ""just not attractive"" and puts people off, and normal people won't want to be with you. Which comes off as ""You have to fix yourself to become worth loving and tolerating."" But she said often it was just ""tough love,"" and as someone desperate to improve themselves, I believed her.

One of the videos I watched on isolating (something I'm terrible for) and she was basically saying that other people can tell and ""think you're weird."" I was kept isolated growing up so I've had to work really hard on my social skills but still experience a lot of social anxiety and struggle to enjoy being around others because I'm used to being alone. I felt I had gotten to the point where I was getting more confident and expressing myself and even building friendships, but what she said started to eat away at me and I felt like everyone was just putting up with me and I was lucky I had some people that were tolerant enough they didn't mind that I was ""weird."" I started questioning everything I was saying and feeling like people were going to reject me because being traumatized would make everyone run away.

The biggest flag of all was being reminded every video about ""her technique"" (which someone else taught her and to my knowledge, doesn't get credited for) and course, FB group, etc. I'd also signed up on her website for her free course and the marketing emails were CONSTANT.

But like most people here, I ignored the red flags and assumed I was ""just being negative"" so I allowed her views to live rent-free in my head because while I knew some of it was wrong, some of it made sense. I started to spiral and lose my progress. I felt depressed and helpless. I stopped going to a group I enjoyed because I thought everyone would think I was weird, and yet also felt terrible because I was ""isolating"" in her terms. For the first time in months, it was getting so bad again I seriously considered not living anymore so I could stop inflicting myself on other people.

Anyway, I came here to search what people thought about her. And WOW. I wish I had looked sooner because I feel like a huge weight has come off my chest. I don't feel alone anymore in what my gut was telling me. Honestly I feel like there could be a pinned post of creators who should be avoided, so others can avoid this experience too.

I guess the big lesson I'm learning is to be more careful with what I allow to influence me. I like to think I'm strong and can just brush it off, but this whole thing goes to show I can't do that at this point in time because I will take one thing someone says and allow it to destroy my mental health.

(Edit 7/1: I thought I would clarify this point further to avoid confusion. I didnâ€™t initially elaborate because I didnâ€™t want to write a novel about this and other aspects of my story. So: I have less issue with the concepts ARâ€™s putting forth, rather the loaded language and negative connotations of her delivery is triggering. I have mentioned this in a comment but I will say it again, at this point in my journey I have a very honest relationship with myself and donâ€™t shy away from the ugly truth. I have no problem calling myself out on my BS, which is why I tried to take ARâ€™s advice constructively and work through how I felt. 

However, I found it triggering regardless of trying to intellectualize around her abrasive delivery. She might be speaking the truth, but there are many ways of expressing your point without causing unnecessary injury to people who are vulnerable. Iâ€™ve learned Iâ€™m still quite sensitive to people who use equative language, where a word and its related concepts are assigned a black-or-white meaning that is often tied up in shame and morality. Word associations are highly personal as well, and what is neutral or even positive to some can be highly negative to another person, which is why some people have no problem overlooking what she says and others canâ€™t handle it. I think as well people underestimate the damage that can be done growing up in an environment with people who donâ€™t verbally abuse but use implication, black-and-white reasoning, and equative language to control and wound their targets. Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot since I made this post and itâ€™s led to a lot of insight for me, which will help me deal with these triggers in the future.)"
CPTSD,A message to my dad,"I know you will never read this, but how dare you. Do you not have any instincts to protect your child? How dare you hit her in front of me when I was only 3/4 years old.

How dare you let your alcohol addiction take over you when you had 4 kids to care for. How dare you continue to play the victim to this day. 

How dare you dismiss my mental health concerns that YOU CAUSED. You probably feel so much guilt because deep down you know you fucked up.

CPTSD,Too soft for the workplace?

One of them even had her children flip me the birdY. Weird sad & crappy ppl.

  
Anyway. I had to leave the desk to take a deep breath, it got so bad.

  
I returned and our General Manager stormed in screaming over and over that I'm never to leave my area. I told him I was entitled to leave & would do the same thing in the same situation. We were understaffed & all the heat was on me- no relief either. I was literally standing off to the side behind a partition, I did't leave, just stood aside for under five min.

  
The GM actually insulted my ethnicity then ran out and slammed the door nearly breaking it.  
The surrounding rental desks (in an airport) did NOTHING to help me feel better or offer ANY support.  
Is this a toxic place? Sounds like it.

  
I could quit but I live in a small town-this job was hard to come by:(

CPTSD,I have recovered a lot but I want to be cured.,"Itâ€™s my first post ever anywhere on reddit. I have scrolled through r/CPTSDNextSteps, r/CPTSD, r/PTSD, r/BPDLovedOnes and many other subs that relate to my situation for about 11 months now. I will write my whole story some other day but I should say that I have almost completely recovered from a range of terrible disorders including anxiety disorder, panic disorder, Pure OCD, Insomnia, Suicidal Ideation, DPDR, Existential Dread etc. All of these were to their extremest extremes and Iâ€™m so happy that these things are gone.

But I am stuck at a spot where I canâ€™t really enjoy my life. Iâ€™ve been stuck at the same spot for 5 months now. I get a mildly annoying anxiety sometimes. I canâ€™t enjoy a good sunset because I get disturbing thoughts like, â€œwhatâ€™s the meaning of this?â€. I get insomniac and depressed when any of my friends or family is struggling with something. Sometimes I just canâ€™t be in the moment while Sometimes Iâ€™m in the moment but then I suddenly question myself, â€œwhy am I feeling good?â€, and the feeling goes away.

CPTSD,How do you handle anger you can't get past?,"Long story short - when I left my ex after multiple traumatic events happened within a short time, I broke emotionally. I left, and for the next decade I was systematically erased from our kids lives. I cannot forgive this kind of evil, and while I have lots of other traumatic things to work through, the fury and resentment and rage I have for this one is visceral. My oldest knows the truth, which is good, but the youngest has been completely brainwashed. 22 and 20 yrs old.

I can't believe that he hated me so much for leaving, that he would do that to not even ME, but his KIDS. How do you even begin to get through this kind of betrayal, and let go of the anger that's holding you captive?"
CPTSD,I'm giving away a tea pot my mother gave to me and I don't feel bad about it,"I'm sorting through my things to give some stuff I don't need/don't want/don't have the space for away and I found a small teapot/mug combo my parents gave to me for my, idk, 20th birthday? I've barely used it, it's not my style (it's pretty though, there's a beach and a lighthouse painted on the outside.) so after thinking, and feeling bad, about it for a mere 1.5 seconds I've decided to give it away. It does not spark joy. I will not tell my mother about it. 

The pricetag is still on the bottom and it costed them 4,99â‚¬ (it was on sale) so I don't feel like I ""wasted their money"".

I'm giving away a bunch of stuff.
A mug my best friend from elementary school gave to me, it was in the back of my cupboard. We've stopped talking soon after 5th grade because she moved schools. And now after over 15 years I'm ready to let go of that memory. 

There's also a bunch of baking stuff my mom gave me when I moved in this apartment. I don't need all that, why did I keep it for almost 9 years? Because I'm a people pleaser and a  Mama's boy and terrified of making her sad. But that will stop now. No more being terrified of saying 'no' to my mother.

Now I just have to find someone to pick everything up because I don't have a car to drive around town and donate all of it to charity stores or women's refuge or whoever needs dishes (and plushies, I also sorted through my plushies and I'm very proud of myself. I finally got rid of that teddy bear that triggers the hell out of me. I had to touch it and it was disgusting but I survived.)

I feel very energized and idk if it's because of my new antidepressants? Because they also make me very sleepy but I feel this surge of energy all the time.

CPTSD,it feels like everyone is ahead of me while iâ€™m still a kid,"iâ€™m 19. i think i stopped developing mentally, or it slowed down a lot around the time i was in middle school. i only had 1 group of friends, and i formed a codependent relationship with 1 which really stunted my developmentâ€¦

i see my friends and their friends and how normal they act and how idk chill and lowkey and unguarded and trusting they are and just being a teenager and during this whole time, i was tormenting myself in my own mind the entire time. i just hated everything and myself and i was always in so much pain.

i learned to let go only recently and now i realizeâ€¦. iâ€™m emotionally stunted. and now i have no friend group, or even friends i think i can truly be â€œmeâ€. and even then, i feel way too immature for my age. i feel like iâ€™m 15.

i want to be a teenager again, but in the better place i am now. is it really just me out there? what do i even do? 

even now i have no agency over my life because iâ€™m stuck living away from my home state and itâ€™s driving me nuts. my hometown is a trigger for my trauma, but i know it will be disastrous when i eventually move back bc of how much iâ€™m forced to avoid it. i hate everything. i have no control and iâ€™m mentally stunted"
CPTSD,Adderall & Meth - predisposition?,"I was diagnosed with â€œADD-like symptoms from PTSD.â€ I had a brain scan and they could actually see all the bits that were firing and which were not, it was amazing. They could pinpoint that all the things Iâ€™ve been experiencing since my teens such as inability to focus, foggy memory, quadruple tasking but not finishing were a byproduct of C-PTSD, but not actually proper ADD. 

I was also recently told that my mother - who had borderline personality disorder and I estranged myself from years ago - used to take meth before I was born. This was a massive shock to me. I donâ€™t even drink and I donâ€™t take recreational drugs, but I was prescribed adderall when I lived back in the states. It made me completely focus and calm, it made all my future-focused and social anxiety dissipate, sort of like a zen-like robot (as it also made my normal emotional personality neutralise.) It made me stop being a people pleaser and feel less agitation. The adderall also allowed me to get through university and when writing an essay, getting everything in my head onto the page without constant white noise and jumbling. When I started the adderall, my mother asked me for some and as I was 16 I couldnâ€™t say no, and then she went to the doctor saying she had ADD so she could get a script (this was in 2005 when it wasnâ€™t as hard to get a script.) She gloated that she loved it made her concentrate and get everything done, while stopping her appetite. 

My question is whether redditors think there could be a genetic predisposition to stimulants, when diagnosed with different things? I didnâ€™t realise how similar the effects of adderall are to meth (just looked this up) and am very curious. Maybe itâ€™s about receptors not firing correctly or simply people prone to a negative mindset feeling leveled out by uppers? My grandma was diagnosed with severe depression her whole life and I know my mother had it as well, and although I donâ€™t have depression I can easily sink into a negative mindset which Iâ€™m very conscious of and practice breathwork/EFT/meditation etc to balance out. 

The meth thing does freak me out and Iâ€™m thinking, god, in taking adderall am I just doing a form of what my mother did to combat whatever faulty wiring is in there? Whether by nature or nurture? I stopped taking adderall but saved three pills from my script from three years ago. I took one today as I just started an online masterâ€™s course and need to write a massive essay (after a decade university hiatus!) so wanted to write this while Iâ€™m feeling it. Now back to the essay!

Thanks for reading and would very much appreciate any considered replies :)

CPTSD,Anyone else with CPTSD feel like an incompetent/inadequate pet parent?,"I welcomed my baby boy (feline, 6 months) home 4 months ago and I am in shambles. Every time something goes wrong I break down in hysterics because my whole life I was told I was a bad person. Iâ€™ve worked for years to try to overcome this and when he entered my life I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. But heâ€™s a kitten so heâ€™s crazy and is still testing the waters of life and whenever something sudden and chaotic happens I break down thinking Iâ€™m the worst mom on earth. Can anyone else relate/does anyone have advice?"
CPTSD,I long to be loved like Joel loves Ellie,"And itâ€™s never going to happen. 

Iâ€™m (44F) late and I guess that you all have watched The Last of Us already, but I  binge watched the show just now. If you havenâ€™t watched the show and still want to, please stop reading, thereâ€™s spoilers coming. 

I didnâ€™t get why everyone raved about the show so much during the first 2 episodes, but the love story of Bill and Frank moved me deeply. So beautiful. Kind of tore a new hole in my heart, because Iâ€™ve never experienced this kind of devoted romantic love.

And then what happened? When Joel searched for Ellie who was being held captive by David, I felt something awaken in me. Painfully. And when he finally found her and held her and said â€œI got you, baby girlâ€, I couldnâ€™t stop crying. Finally, episode 9 was bringing this way up to another level for me. 

I spent many, many years in therapy. Most of those years I spent talking about how mentally unstable and sadistic mother has fucked me up beyond repair. Every session was about her. I think it was only 2 years ago or so when I realised that I actually also have â€œdaddy issuesâ€. Mother married 4 times. Biological father abused me physically and neglected me heavily from infancy to the point of putting my life in danger. Adoptive father abused me sexually and just cut me out of his life when he found a new wife to have a son with. He told me he will never allow me to meet â€œmy brotherâ€, will never give me his address and changed his phone number. This has been 25 years ago. And though I know that he is a piece of shit, just like all the other â€œfather figuresâ€ mother came up with, the hurt that I have never had a father who loved me like Joel loved Ellie is too muchâ€¦ 

How do I get over this?"
CPTSD,Leaving this sub for erroneous warnings.,"The mods are power mad.

I received a reddit warning against my account for breaking the rule to not threaten, bully or harass.

And so you'd think that I had done one of those three things right?

Nope. I merely commented on a recent post that I don't believe it's feasible that a safe space can be created on the internet due to the number of users.

That's it. No threats. No bullying. No harassment.

Anyway, hope it all works out guys, peace."
CPTSD,Integrating New Safety,"How do you integrate, or truly adapt to safe and fulfilling relationships to the extent that one would stop believing their old maladaptive beliefs, such as ""I am unlovable,"" or ""everyone will abandon or betray me eventually?"" I have hurt family in the past saying things like ""I thought 'they really do love me,'"" and have been told I am a little bit of a ""black hole,"" and my brother told me I'm a ""broken person."" It's very, very hard to feel OK or trust people after the crap I went through, starting at age 4. I want to really appreciate and enjoy the good people in my life, and not hurt them by overlooking or disbelieving their love."
CPTSD,Sibling Abuse: The Other Side,"I (22F) abused my younger sibling  (7 year age gap) for a good portion of their toddler-preteen years.

I wanted to speak out because sibling abuse is criminally understated. I have been trying to find resources for people who *are* the abusers and want to acknowledge the past to heal and grow because I *do* have shame and confusion. My heart is with those who have spoken out and were forced to double-down.

I was physically and/or verbally abusive between the ages of 11-17 and my sibling was 4-11. We grew up in a dysfunctional home. Our father was undiagnosed Bipolar 2 causing him to be extremely volatile and flighty while my mother was a catatonically depressed workaholic; she had no presence at home although she was our primary caretaker after our father finally left.  Thus was the start that I, 8 years old at the time, was left to care for my 1-year old infant sibling.

I was parentified as a child. It was only me and a toddler in a very big house for hours or days at a time. I never had a chance. I took my anger out on the closest vulnerable thing to me because I was so alone in everything. There were times when I completely lost my temper over the simplest things and modeled myself to be an absolute nightmare, similar to our father. Of course I was unaware that the entire dynamic was toxic because every time I reached out to anyone I was gaslit and told, ""These are things older sisters go through."" or my favorite, ""If you don't do it no-one will."", and even ""I provide you with everything you need, so, do as I say"". Imagine my surprise when I found out that there were families that did NOT behave this way.

When I was 15-17 the physical and verbal abuse turned into neglect. If I didn't eat, then they didn't eat, and I wasn't eating because I developed an eating disorder and was catatonic, similar to my mother. Pizza Rolls were a primary food group in my home.

Now my sibling and I still had a lot of really great moments (coincidentally when I was relieved of my parenting duties) and I think those moments are what keeps our relationship hanging on by a thread. These moments didn't happen often, but when they were good, they were great and we do reminisce, which I'm grateful for, however; I believe that deep down my sibling is still afraid of me.

At 18 I ran away and tried to catch the bus. After I missed the bus I had to do a lot of reflection because all I felt was guilt for trying to leave my sibling alone with our fucked up parents. I went to my sibling and apologized for how I treated them without mentioning the reasons why I was so volatile, but I know the conversation isn't over.

I want to bring it up in a non-triggering way that will show that I am deeply regretful and also a victim. It's very hard to call myself a victim because I became the perpetrator and I carry nothing but guilt, but it's the truth. Unlike my parents or anyone else I reached out to as a troubled teen I recognize the cycle of abuse, am willing to admit it and my part in it, AND DISMANTLE IT.

**TL;DR Question 1: How can I bring this up to my sibling in a non-triggering way that will show that I am deeply regretful and also a victim?**

**Question 2: If you are a victim of sibling abuse, what would make you feel safe again overtime?**

**3. If you are a victim of sibling-abuse please share your thoughts, think-pieces, concerns, critiques, questions, literally anything. I want to hear more anecdotes so that I can bridge the gap between my own sibling and I.**

**EDIT 4. Are there any literature or essays that you have read that has resonated with your experience and helped you to work through the trauma?** "
CPTSD,A catch 22 in my personal life.,"20m with CPTSD and BPD here, recently been struggling alot with loneliness and becoming triggered from sexual and relationship related topics whether it's in real life or on social media.

The trauma I've been through in my life has caused me to become hypersexual and I have a deep desire for intimacy and to be loved. But at the same time after multiple negative/unhealthy/counterproductive experiences in that department and a very toxic relationship last year I am too scared to let anyone close to me emotionally whatsoever out of fear of being hurt again etc and feel to much shame and other negative emotions to seek out intimacy even though my cravings for it are so bad it controls my life alot. 

I feel like I should just shut myself off from relationships with people forever because I don't know how to have a healthy one after having so many poor experiences and being surrounded by undesirable people in undesirable places alot of my life. But at the same time I feel a lot of pressure to find a partner, have a family etc; alot of people my age have already had children and are moving on with there lives, already have a set in stone social circle they've been apart of for a while, have goals careers. 

And I'm just stuck here wishing I could have a healthy relationship but am losing hope and becoming more bitter with life the longer I am lonely, and when I am reminded of hookup culture, abusive relationship situations in my life or someone I know, hear of divorces and family drama it discourages me alot because I've never known anything healthy and alot of other people haven't either and the toxic cycles just continue and become the norm in society and it feels like I will never have the ""1960's romance"" I dream about.

Im too scared for another heartbreak, and It hurts too much to be lonely. I don't know what to do."
CPTSD,I'm not sure how to deal with the nightmares,"Does anyone have ideas on how to deal with the nightmares and the feeling of being in trouble or under surveillance when trying to sleep? My mom is very emotionally abusive she used to be physically abusive and sometimes she still threatens to hit me or slap me. She did shove me more recently and it hurt. I just wanted to share that as an explanation of why I'm so afraid of her. I'm an adult but I have a disability and I have to live with her and two other siblings.

Recently she said that I'm a waste and honestly I don't disagree. I'm deeply depressed do to how endless it feels. My nightmares have gotten so bad I woke up screaming and trying to ""get it off me"" but there was nothing there. I'm not sure what caused it to get so bad when it had been feeling better. I have a nightlight and it's the only reason I can sleep at all. I'm constantly thinking about how my mom says living life for the sake of living is a waste. She thinks I enjoy this life but she is very, very wrong. I'm afraid of my mental health getting worse. I've been constantly thinking about death. I don't want to die but I don't want to keep being a burden and a waste of a life."

CPTSD,More than 1 family member recovering/healthy from CPTSD?,"Hi everyone. 

I am asking for your stories to encourage myself.  Do any of you who are recovering/getting healthier have siblings who are getting healthier themselves too?

 I have a younger sibling who is doing things to hurt himself and risk his life continuously and it breaks my heart to see him constantly suffer the deep pains of our childhood abuse.  Its a very touch and go situation for my sibling tonight and I feel a despair/intense grief tonight about his situation and want to hold on to some hope he will recover and start to have some joy, peace and nurturing relationships.  I passed through my own very dark seasons of recovery from CPTSD and horrible childhood abuse and I now know how bright things can be on the other side and I want that for him too.

 Please give me any positive stories of those of you who have siblings who are also recovering as you are.   I want hope stories of you and at least one family member recovering please.   Hope.  Thanks in advance."
CPTSD,Is the goal of public humiliation suicide?,"Do people who think theyâ€™re entitled to ruin your life want you to kill yourself? They have taken all of your confidence, all of your past friends. They have taken any hope you have in making a future for yourself. I was 16 when a girl claimed I SAâ€™d her, and then lied and said I did it to other girls and while she was asleep. I was with maybe 2 girls at the time she said that including her. I donâ€™t feel comfortable even looking at a women, I donâ€™t feel comfortable being around men because I got sexually assaulted a few months after that. Nearly 3-4 times a week I attempt suicide, the first I was the closest to right after what that girl said. My mom stopped me right as when I was in the middle of it. I donâ€™t feel safe living in my own city, A lot of the times Iâ€™m barely holding on. I saw this girl earlier last year, not too long after seeing a best friend get shot. I donâ€™t know why but the thought came out and said â€œyou have never almost been shot beforeâ€ which she used as a threat against her. Iâ€™ve never owned a gun fired a gun, Iâ€™ve only seen one go off once when the bullet missed my head by inches and shot my best friend in his neck. In 5 months I can start the 6 month long expungement process and get it dismissed, I was charged with a terroristic threat and the store owner kicked my other friend out before he could of gave his statement and changed the outcome. My friends death anniversary is in a few days, almost bring 1 year since it happened. Not a day goes by I wish I was the one shot. So I could never think about her and all the people who harassed me ever again."
CPTSD,"I think my dad may have saâ€™d me as a kid, any advice is really appreciated","I just write this and hope it wonâ€™t delete so Iâ€™m sorry if this is rushed and full of errors and having a hard time writing this.

For context Iâ€™m a 17 year old girl. My parents divorced when I was around 5 and we visited my dad on weekend from that point on. We also used to go to his house for months at some points but that started when I was a pre teen I believe. 

I also have an older brother (2yrs) and younger sister (2 yrs) but Iâ€™ve always been favourited  by our dad. It wasnâ€™t a secret, he would admit it and be overly affectionate towards me. I remember being a little kid and uncomfortable by it but I would always try to make him happy no matter what. 

I was as people pleaser as I could be towards eveyy fr one but especially my dad. My siblings used to kinda bully me and I would freak out but my dad would always just tell them to do whatever and we would be alone. (Thing is now that I write that I canâ€™t remember being alone with him but I can remember him telling my siblings to go all the time and then we would be alone?) 

It was to the point his siblings and other people would even tell him to chill out with his affection towards me. He would also always use a baby voice, even to me now and Iâ€™m 17. Like a real baby voice you use for a baby or a dog. I hated it. It made me so uncomfortable, when I was a kid I didnâ€™t like it but it was just something I thought was normal I guess. But as I grew up he never stopped and I used to get upset and â€œfightâ€ with him about it ( literally me breaking down while him and my stepmom say things like â€œI liked itâ€ or â€œnever used to have an issueâ€ or heâ€™d say heâ€™d stop and then continue the next day). 

For more context my dad met/got with my mom when he was 28 and she was 17. And from what Iâ€™ve been told it was literally textbook grooming and the whole story disgusts me. Now heâ€™s with my stepmom whose 30 and heâ€™s 58 (met her when she was new to Canada in her early 20â€™s and he was her senior). 

Anyways the reason Iâ€™m writing this is because Iâ€™ve been having awful intrusive thoughts for the past few months. They happened a lot throughout my childhood too but now itâ€™s all I can think about. Itâ€™s of my dad and me. And itâ€™s not a full memory but itâ€™s like flashes (I also have always had a really bad disassociating problem and my memory is trash). Itâ€™s of my dad and me and being naked and his naked body and his hands and itâ€™s horrible and disgusting. It clouds my brain and eats away at me and I get this horrible feeling of shame and my body tenses up and I cry just from thinking about it too much. 

I havenâ€™t been doing anything sexual with my boyfriend either lately. One time I started having a panic attack essentially because I kept picturing my dad while my boyfriend and I were having sex. I just told him I was overwhelmed which is normal to happen to me during sexual stuff.

I also have a panic disorder sort of thing, I am basically emotionally overwhelmed all the time and also have problems with my self image and self harm for as long as I can remember. About a month ago I cracked and told my therapist Iâ€™ve been thinking this stuff about my dad and heâ€™s been really careful to not put any thoughts in my head but also said that I do have signs of serious trauma.

I also dream weird stuff about my dad basically every night. Sometimes thereâ€™s something sexual but usually itâ€™s just me as a kid in the house and Iâ€™m hiding from him. And I feel that horrible Shame feeling and Iâ€™m just so scared. I just want it to stop but itâ€™s clear itâ€™s not going to unless I either figure it out or talk it out or something.

Any advice is really really appreciated. Thank you if you read all that and Iâ€™m sorry for any errors."
CPTSD,If you canâ€™t trust your own family who can you trust?,"Posting on my alt account to preserve mine and my daughterâ€™s privacy. I just want to get it off my chest and I apologize if this is long.

My four year old daughter a couple weeks back gave me reason to believe she was touched inappropriately by a cousin of mine who is staying at my momâ€™s (daughterâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s) house. To add insult to injury I facilitated my cousinâ€™s sponsorship by allowing my family to use my bank statements as proof that I would support him after immigrating to America. I even did paralegal work to push his case forward as the attorney my family hired was less than useful in the process. 

I told my daughter I believed her, being a victim of CSA myself. My daughter gave me the tightest hug everâ€¦ it made all the hairs all over my body go up. I have never felt anything like it. I immediately contacted her pediatrician and the child abuse hotline. CPS was at my house the same night. I requested a child play therapist for my daughterâ€” but as expected, they if anything have been counterproductive in the process. Iâ€™m getting her a private play therapist come Monday since they are taking so long to do anything. 

When I told my mom my daughter did not feel safe at her house, do you think she asked who, what, when, where, why, how? No. She berated me and was SO offended as to HOW I could believe she gets anything less than excellent treatment while in her care.

I reminded my mother that she made her choice 25+ years ago to not believe me, twiceâ€¦ And now it was my turn to be a parent, and I donâ€™t fucking care if it means burning all the bridges with my family to the groundâ€”- I fucking believe my daughter and will protect her until my last dying breath.

Do you know what she had the audacity to ask me? I will never forget it. She asked me why didnâ€™t ***I*** report my abuse to my pediatrician as a child if it was true. Needless to say, I hung up on her. She is dead to me. The last thing I did was mail her Paul Walkerâ€™s CPTSD book in her language, wrapped up from Amazon with a note that said, â€œI hope you heal. Happy holidays. â€”- Jupiter and Daughterâ€

No one in my family except my sister has contacted me since. If you canâ€™t even trust your own family, who do you trust? I will never be able to feel safe with my daughter being cared for by someone else again. 

Iâ€™m not perfect but Iâ€™m doing all I can to protect my baby, in a way no one cared to take care of me at her age because it was too much of an inconvenience. I never was too comfortable leaving her with my mom but didnâ€™t have much choiceâ€” I empathized with her and forgave her for being emotionally neglectful to me due to her own issues but I could have never imagined after 25+ years she would not have self reflected even a little bit on what she could have done betterâ€¦ I fucking hate myself for giving her the benefit of the doubt that back then she â€œdid the best she could with the resources she had at the time.â€ Now, after all this I canâ€™t help but view her as anything less than a monster.

To end on a positive note, my daughter is doing well. She does not want to see her grandmother and just wants to be with me. We are isolated right now so I signed her up for gymnastics where I can keep an eye on her as she practices. I work from home so she is now learning how to let me work because I canâ€™t afford childcare after bills and the mortgage as a solo parent. Next week I have an appointment with a community based organization to gather as many resources as possible to get us through this living nightmare.

Thankfully since the incident my daughter has told me numerous times she feels safe, happy, and wants to be with me â€œforever.â€ I told her, if thatâ€™s how she feels, then I am doing my job right as her parent, and I love her so much and will always believe and protect her, now and always. 

Despite being damaged by my CPTSD, I will keep putting one foot in front of the other to healâ€” if not for me, for my daughter. I will not allow our generational trauma to define us. We will get through this together and thrive, just me and herâ€” if thatâ€™s what it takes.

Thank you to those who took the time to read this. "
CPTSD,Depression improves. Fatigue doesnâ€™t.,"Iâ€™ve had super bad fatigue for about half a year now, and depression symptoms as far back as I can remember. Doctors have been telling me that the fatigue is just my depression. 
The depression is finally improving, but not the fatigue. Iâ€™m so tired. Nothing helps."
CPTSD,"Need some loving kindness from my people, please","So, long story short-ish, 2 weeks ago my fiancÃ© called the police, told them I had a knife and that I hurt myself or planned on it. We have been together for almost 4 years (our anniverary is January 30th) and he knows about my traumatizing past. I am managed by a wonderful mental health team and do a lot of good work regularly to keep myself even-keeled and mostly panic attack free. My trauma has previously caused suicide attempts, but it has been 17 years since my last attempt. 


A large recurring issue in our relationship is him not being able to support me emotionally. We have done individual therapy and couples therapy, but he would never stick with it long enough for meaningful change to occur. It seemed like when it came to my emotional safety, he just never thought it was as important as I said it was. 

Anyway, Wednesday of that week, I got some tough news and hadn't seen my fiancÃ© since Sunday due to a dog-sitting commitment. I reached out via text and called him numerous times to talk, but I was met with his own shit instead of listening to me and being supportive. 
By Friday, despite our having plans together, I'd had it. I did not want to be around him and told him as much. I told him to his face that he fucked up again and dropped the ball when I really needed him. In my anger, I said that even if I'd wanted to hang myself, he would not have noticed. 

Well, he took that one part of my whole rant and took flight with it. I left the house saying that I wanted him gone when I returned and went back to my dog-sitting duties. I turned off my phone because he kept calling and texting
. 
2 hours later, I return to my home and he is still there. He called my therapist (who I had spoken to THAT DAY, about 6 hours prior) and expressed to her that he couldn't reach me and he was afraid I'd harmed myself. She called me and we chatted, set a time for the next day and hung up. My therapist has since told me her professional opinion was that I was pissed at him and not a danger to myself. She was right, but it didn't matter. He had already called 911 and reported that I had a knife and was hurting myself. I didn't know this until I got home and he said ""You're probably going to be mad, but I called the police."" 
There was an APB out on my vehicle and I had absolutely no clue. I was absolutely shocked when I saw police officers surrounding my home. 

Right then and there I told him that now it really was over. A police officer patted me down in my driveway, convinced I had a knife. I did not. I was taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and ultimately released, but I am not without trauma from this incident. 

About 5 days later, I attempted to reach out to my fiancÃ© and he still has not spoken with me. His father, who helped him move out, gave me more validation than he likely ever will. 

Am I the actual asshole or was I just duped for 4 yesrs while trying to keep it together for both of us? Clearly I need some validation because I cannot make sense of anything- from the events of that evening to his subsequent coldness and ignoring me. 

And why did the police listen to a hysterical man who had no basis on which to make such a call? What happened to 72 hours!?"
CPTSD,Experiences with memory loss?,"Would love to hear more about otherâ€™s experiences when it comes to memory loss. I havenâ€™t been able to see a therapist in nearly a decade (not because I donâ€™t want to) but lately my ability to remember conversations throughout my day, pretty basic things is just gone. Itâ€™s also relevant to state after a year of sobriety, I relapsed over the holidays with alcohol - even since the days Iâ€™ve stopped drinking again though; I canâ€™t remember an important conversation I had with my SO just the other night. It came up this evening and he wanted to discuss further, and I just couldnâ€™t, because I had almost zero recollection of what we discussed. I wasnâ€™t drunk and I do not understand why this happens, but itâ€™s now caused an even more immense separation between us and I need to desperately work on myself so I can fix it and mend things within myself and my cherished partnership. Basically Iâ€™m just curious to know if anyone else experiences this. It sucks more than I can explain. Feeling super hopeless and ashamed lately. Ugh."
CPTSD,I had to cut my toxic family out of my life,My parents are responsible for most of my trauma my parents refuse to take accountability for any of their actions or words  it's why half my siblings are in fostercare and adopted out my last argument with them was the last straw im doing better than ever im making progress mentally and physically
CPTSD,I'm so scared to enjoy life...,"I'm so afraid to enjoy life. Like, I have time, have money, my wife supports me and loves me, but I can't feel safe. I always feel like I'm in a danger zone and can't relax.  
I feel like if I do relax and start enjoying something, then I'll be struck by the life that something terrible would happen and I'll only be hurt more if I think of a second that things will be ok.

I'm kind of always ready to fight/run.  
But it doesn't go away, because nothing bad happens. And I stay in this state, and stay. And stay. And it messes me up, because I can't live.

I want to scream ""PLEASE, HELP ME, I don't want this life :("" But no one will hear, and no one can help..."
CPTSD,Has anyone here ever gone through a period in your life where you have to just let go of everything you thought you were so that you could simply survive?,"My life has completely crumpled around me. Traumatic event after traumatic event. It's as if the view from here is just jarring. I thought things that weren't true. Serious mind-bending hear-stopping things. I was incredibly naive. And I see it with such clarity. I see I will never be able to just relax and finally feel loved. And there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

I am being reborn and it is so painful to think I'd had a life and now that life, as I knew it, is gone and so are many family members this past year. My father will also pass soon. It will be so very different going forward and I feel I've never known who I am or what I really am made of. I'll be 53 this month. That's a long time to not know oneself. Who could I possibly be now? Can I get that little girl back? Can she have a do-over? No, I don't think she can. 

I am so thankful for my children. I hate though, that they've become my reason for staying in what has become, I can't even think of the words to describe my environment right now, but chaotic comes close...ish. But they don't deserve my childhood. They are the sweetest beings and the only light left in my heart. It is for them that I am willing to give up my dreams of feeling and being loved in the way I need. I will find a way. I always do. I just wonder who I will be in the end, because right now I feel like a total stranger to myself.

CPTSD,cptsd from religious trauma?,"hey all. iâ€™ve been doing some research on shame and toxic shame and itâ€™s been very very cathartic and eye opening to me. i think this deep sense of shame and guilt has been projected onto me by my parents have since birth (literally)

i was born premature. i was supposed to be due by january but came out in october. every horrible thing you can think of, the doctors said i was going to have. wheelchair, blind, deaf, down syndrome. many times they offered my mom to get an abortion. i also had a very very complicated birth. they had to take me away immediately to either give me oxygen or heart surgery i donâ€™t remember. i had lots of surgeries when i was a kid. had to get my retinas reattached, heart and kidney surgeries. had to stay in a incubator for months before they brought me home. i very recently saw a photo of me in the incubator having my last rights read to me while my mom cried.

my parents were always religious, my mother a devout christian and my dad a catholic. my mom and dad have an interesting relationship. my mom basically chased my dad since the day she laid eyes on him in 9th grade. he only noticed her in college when she grew her hair out. my dad was controlling and my mom was clingy. he eventually became a christian after dating my mom. my mother swears she brought him to christ but really it was his friend at work. she also fully believes that even though he treats her and the rest of our family like shit, it was her purpose to bring him to god, which again she didnâ€™t. so she failed at that too. my mom does way too much for him and my dad is still controlling and lowkey couldnt give a shit about her. they are both still unfortunately christian. 

back to my birth, because of all the complications of my birth my mom believes that i am basically the living embodiment of christ and proof that he exists. but it was actually the insanely educated, caring genius doctors and nurses. and i am very aware that it is amazing that i am here, again thank you amazing doctors and nurses. they completely discourage the years of education and skill and say it was all because of some man in the sky. itâ€™s very insulting actually. 

i am very thankful to be alive, but at the same time there is also this huge guilt iâ€™ve felt since birth to believe in god. i am atheist and have been for a long time now, but they donâ€™t know that lol. whenever i even slightly bring up not believing she cuts me off and something along the lines of â€œhow could you? why are you here right now then? youâ€™re lucky to even be aliveâ€.  they are also insanely conservative, so whenever the topic of abortion comes up itâ€™s always â€œi couldâ€™ve aborted you, how would you feel to not be hereâ€ also wanted to say that weâ€™ve never even attended church officially. i only ever went to church in summer to basically be babysat and sing worship songs. church was on the tv in sundays but i never payed attention. i have been skeptical even since i was little. 

so all this shame since birth has been projected onto me by parents. everything was bad to them. sex was bad, money was bad, dragons on t shirts were bad. they were often very judgemental, wondered what people would think of me, wanted me to be â€œgood and rightâ€. i often fear disappointing them by living my own life that has nothing to do with the lord. i donâ€™t feel shame from the church, but more shame from my parents. that iâ€™m not good, that iâ€™m a disappointment, deep sense dread, fear, guilt etc. all the bad things shame brings. does this count as religious trauma? do i belong here? does anyone know how to help? thank you all for reading. u can check my horrific post history for more backstory if u want. thank u again"
CPTSD,wish i could remember more,"its all just feelings, mostly fear. i create thoughts to go with them, but why i have these thinking patterns? i dont know.

wish i had more memories to connect things back to, or at the very least help me feel like im not faking it. i had a bunch of stuff written down on my old phone, but i forgot my passcode.

i just hate living in this fog. i feel like i was only born 2 years ago. before that i was sleepwalking"
CPTSD,I lost time for the first time in years,"Tonight I got triggered while out and about and magically appeared at home. It was only a ten to twelve minute walk so itâ€™s not like i dissociated for ages  and ages. 

But damn, itâ€™s scary when your lizard brain takes over and autopilots you home. Just glad Iâ€™m home.

Do you ever just lose time like that, dissociating?"
CPTSD,Does anyone else feel like this?,"Anyone else feel like their blood/skin is literally boiling and screaming to escape. Times like this I cannot believe I'm still living the life I am and I just wonder and realise that i could very well run. Escape. Go to where I feel safe and certain. To scratch this eternal damn itch that makes me feel so fidgety.
I just want to run. Bite. Fight. I need something more. I want from life what It owes me after all the hell and fire it's put me through. I'm sick of scraping by. Hoping for a life worth living for. I want to breathe and be certain. I want to experiance what others do when they're happy. I'm sick of fearing for my life and what people think of me. I hate this. I want to run and run and tear this all away.

Sorry im super drunk. And super tired. I feel like my bloods trying to leave my skin in every direction."
CPTSD,6-year-old me never imagined sheâ€™d one day end up in a psych ward but thatâ€™s where I feel Iâ€™m gonna end up and Iâ€™m terrified,"I lock myself up in my house and avoid going to same grocery stores so same people donâ€™t see me and target me for whatever reason. I feel like Iâ€™m going insane and itâ€™s constantly getting worse. I canâ€™t afford therapy now and even if could I have an intense fear that they would target me too. I canâ€™t work, I canâ€™t do anything. 

We hear stories and news about victims facing harm mostly from people they already know. How am I supposed to ever function in this messed up world? 

How do you guys handle trust and safety in your lives, especially when there's that huge fear that even friendly gestures might hide some not-so-great intentions? I'd like to hear your experiences and any advice you might have for navigating these terrible emotions. 

Someone PLEASE help cause Iâ€™m this far away from jumping off a cliff, Iâ€™m constantly hearing imaginary screaming in my head and I canâ€™t take this anymore."
CPTSD,Has anyone ever recorded their abuser?,"I am sick and tired of being told that things that were said were not said, to the point where I have been tempted to record conversations (could be with or without consent). I haven't done this mainly because i feel like they would find some other way of denying everything, but I am curious if anyone has actually done this and if so what was the outcome?"
CPTSD,Healing generational hoarding,"Looking for geuine advice-

My father, his father and my mom's mom were all hoarders. My family is still dealing with storage units from my grandmother. I don't want to end up anything like them.

I've learned through my years of therapy that I carry these tendencies. I don't want to end up anything like them. I'm a college senior and moved into my freshman dorm with way too much stuff. Long story short, I've lived off campus in 2 different places before coming back to the dorms and I'm hoping to stay in my current dorm if I go to grad school here (which is very likely). I'm ready to make my dorm feel like a home.

**Now this is the advice I'm looking for-** What is the kind of headspace I can practice to say 'goodbye' to the things I don't need anymore? I've practiced sectioning my room in spots with my therapist to better handle parts one at a time. But I get so overwhelmed that my mind goes blank and I fall into a state of panic when making these piles of stuff I'm getting rid of.

I've done so many hacks to stay organized throughout my entire life. My current dorm room is a mess because it's incredibly hard for me to get rid of things I don't use anymore. Iâ€™ve also become physically disabled in the past year and a half where I get winded and tired easily. So keeping up with my room is even harder. My mom and her friend are going to help me organize my room before the start of the next semester. They are both very good at helping other people organize. So I am looking forward to the help. But I would like to know how I can keep myself calm when my anxiety picks up."

CPTSD,Stuff I realized after visiting my hometown for a week and a half,"1. I need friends and a partner more than I was led to believe by my parents. I need nice people around me to feel happy, and I like talking to people (everyone in my family 
2. I may not ever find a husband because since I was 10 I have only ever felt sadness, and have never had a crush on anyone. 
3. I was such a warm child, but grew into a cold person because my parents were selfish. 
4. My aunt told me about how spoiled my dad was and how he was kissed everyday by his sisters and loved unconditionally, so he expected that same energy from me even though he only showed me rudeness and selfishness. 
5. My family has no clue that I have experienced anxiety my entire life, and they will always think I am a shy, intelligent girl who always has a plan (even though I had no clue what was going on in high school, chose easy college majors, and have no plan for anything). 
6. By textbook definition I was emotionally neglected by my parents, brother, cousin, and aunt (except maybe not the other one?) and have all the characteristics, but my entire family never realized and made me feel like I was doing something wrong by experiencing depression. 

Since leaving my hometown I feel like it is SO much more difficult for me to communicate? I haven't seen my friends in weeks and returned to work after a week and a half yesterday. I feel like I can't communicate. I feel like I have regressed back to my teenage self. I'm going to try to reach out to some people to see if they want to hangout, and see if I get back to normal. "
CPTSD,Women: Do you get PTSD flashbacks as a Premenstrual Symptom?,"Iâ€™ve been getting flashbacks and feeling depressed a week before my menstrual. The flashbacks are really intense and they last for days! I sit and cry about all the traumatic memories and for some odd reason, theyâ€™re really specific and appear in my mind as clear as a photograph."
CPTSD,C-ptsd is more prevalent than I thought,"Discovering now how much C-ptsd is actually affecting me. Started dating this guy and all is well, but then we went on this trip and I got over stimulated and exposed to language that makes me uncomfortable. 
This all led to me being very dysregulated, dissociating and getting triggered all in one weekend in front of the guy I just started dating. I am normally very on top of keeping myself regulated but my people pleasing and  anxious attachment got the best of me and all I could do was think about how to not make a fuss, not getting upset, not asking for any of my needs etc. which made things worse of course. 
All of the feelings of fear of abandonment, fear of rejection, fear of disappointment, guilt, fear of not being enough came to the surface. 

The guy Iâ€™m talking to is so responsive and being very understanding. Asking me what he can do to support me, how he can understand me, be aware of my dissociation and over stimulation, and more. He is doing everything a person does who cares about you and wants to be there to support you. 

Last night I got high thinking lemme relax. Wrong. He said he was going out with friends from high school, college and work and invited anyone who could come. Idky this really got to me like why didnâ€™t he invite me. Iâ€™m looking at it today as heâ€™s not ready to introduce me to people like that, and he knows Iâ€™m recovering from the weekend. 

This also is telling me my obsessive and jealous side is coming out because I donâ€™t want him to go out without me. I hate the feeling of anxiety that I was having. 

I realize I really need to focus on myself right now. While he is fitting all of my wants and needs in a partner, it is still my responsibility to take care of myself. I can only be a good partner if I am stable in myself and secure. 

Goals for a few weeks: no texting. Scheduled calls. Only hangout once a week. Nice dates once a month. Sunday-Thursday is for myself no exceptions."
CPTSD,Look at us! We're doing fantastic! You inspire me.,"I sometimes take long breaks from this sub because it can be a lot to immerse myself in trauma world all the time, so I titrate as needed. But wow, I'm seeing so many supportive comments the past couple days checking in. You know what I see? The vast majority of you get it. You get that you were conditioned. You're trying to undo the conditioning. You're learning that the guilt and shame are a LIE that began with the abuser but that you had to believe in order to survive when things were inescapable. And you're teaching others who are just unplugging from the trauma matrix how to do the same. I see you growing. I see us growing!!!! And I am so excited and proud of you I could just melt. Every single one of you. Fantastic job! You, Me, Us. We're doing it! We're really doing it.

edit: Maybe it would be fun if we used this thread to announce some of the growth we've seen in ourselves and how it feels to KNOW you're healing because you finally recognize the good in yourself, in others, etc. Just anything inspiring and hopeful for all of us with trauma. What do the good moments or days look like for you, when you're not in the shade of trauma?"
CPTSD,I feel safe (Update),"So I posted a few months ago(october) about my internship at a sheltered workshop. And since the 2nd of January I started working there - and it's awesome. 
It's the first time I just felt like a normal human beeing, I feel safe there and accepted. If something triggers me, they all understand. 
Nobody asked me why my hands are shaking (tremor, chronical), nobody asked why I'm so tense or why my mood shanges so quickly sometimes. 
I probably will be there for 2 years now, then we'll see if I can go back into the ""normal"" working space or if I should stay there, whatever. 
But after so many years of trauma staking up on trauma this feels like the first breath of fresh air after drowning."
CPTSD,Winter is a hard season for me,"My narcissistic, mentally, and emotionally abusive step mother ruined my first time experiencing snow for me when I was a child. 

I was born and raised in South Texas and it snowed for the first time in like 90 years or something like that when I was 12 years old. I had always dreamed about my first snow experience growing up. I wanted to build a snowman and throw snowballs cause it looked like so much fun seeing it in movies. 

Well my parents, siblings, and I went to go stay on my aunt and uncles farm for a weekend to BBQ and so my dad could go deer hunting with my uncle. Well it was a huge surprise when it started snowing. I was so excited! My cousin's, siblings, parents, and and uncle all got their shoes and jackets on to go outside and play in it. As I started getting my shoes and jacket on, my evil step mother told me I had to stay in the house and wasn't allowed to go out and play in the snow until everyone else was done and back inside the house. So I sat at the window watching everyone play in the snow and having so much fun. Then when everyone came in she said I could go out there and play by myself. It was night time too. So I went out there and I cried the entire time I built a snowman by myself. It destroyed me and my heart was just broken beyond repair, that was the last straw for me mentally cause she would do shit like that to me all the time. That was when I started self harming. 

After I went no contact at the age of 17, I decided I would leave texas for good some day. At 24 years old, I finally was able to leave Texas and moved to Nebraska. And of course it snows here every winter. And it's so beautiful and I love seeing the snow. Im 32 now and have not been able to get myself to play in the snow even though I so badly still want to as an adult but everytime I think I might go build a snowman or something, I end up crying hard and just can't get myself to go out and enjoy the snow cause my heart is still broken for my child self. It kills me that she ruined what could have been a great memory as a child. Im so fucking sad and just want to hug child me and tell her it's okay. I try to do that now in a way but it just doesn't help :("
CPTSD,Need to make a decision but I just canâ€™t,"

Iâ€™ve never felt so paralyzed with a decision and terrified to act in my entire life and it feels so difficult to get people to understand. I canâ€™t tell you what happened two years ago at my first apartment, but I was under lots of stress, things kept happening peneing and I kept thinking my feelings were wrong and needed to be controlled. It was all so much, so many events, trying to get work done, so much stuff. I found when we moved from that apartment I just. I felt absolutely nothing. The harm was gone but I was just a shell. Then more events started piling up again. More and more and I made a misstep and moved when I shouldnâ€™t have. Now here I am again feeling my feelings, but itâ€™s just triggers on and on in a new apartment that I canâ€™t be in without all my alarms going off. I want to move so bad, thereâ€™s a place right next to my school, it would work I could actually get things done. Am I running away again? My parents took me home after a particularly bad anxiety attack and I should be going back on Monday but I just cannot make a decision for the entire life of me. Iâ€™m so stuck and I need to decide how to sublet my room (itâ€™s a bit complicated my roommates are agreeing that I can sublet if the mice are gone but theyâ€™re mice and weâ€™ve done all we can but they wonâ€™t just go away) or I figure out how to stay in an apartment thatâ€™s two hours away from my school with roommates Iâ€™ve tried to communicate with but have been showed that they are deflective and do not want to find solutions, only â€˜winâ€™ conflicts. My next semester starts January 17th. 

What do you do when you just. Donâ€™t know? Every answer is terrifying. The idea of even stepping in my apartment sets my entire body off, itâ€™s not a no maybe, itâ€™s an absolute I do not want to go in there. I barely remember what happened at my first apartment, but the last two years have affected me in such a way, Iâ€™ve put off my needs for so long, that Iâ€™m sitting here. Missing my friends who I moved away from, getting takes from my partner, parents, and friends all voicing different opinions. 

I have no idea Iâ€™m so terrified, Iâ€™m so terrified and my roommates arenâ€™t particularly bad bad, but just like mean girls who have been exceedingly difficult to communicate with. The expectations they have that I cannot work into my schedule because the place is two hours away from my school. I just want to get out I need to get out i canâ€™t please everyone. Iâ€™m in college full time, I work while In school, and Iâ€™m in art school and we have very very large projects. Iâ€™ve been under stress and receiving the consequences for that stress and itâ€™s peaking to a point where I feel like I canâ€™t make decisions and thinking about the situation and what the right decision has kept me in a constant state of fight or flight. 

I have a consultation for a therapist on Monday but I have some insurance stuff to work out. Something has just been happening to me for putting off myself and my needs and now that Iâ€™ve started these antidepressants and feeling my emotions, Iâ€™m feeling the consequences I think. Because off them I just didnâ€™t care, I was just tired and on edge but I couldnâ€™t care about anything more than the bare minimum. 

Has anyone else had such a big decision to make and have just been so terrified of everything?

I have no idea what Iâ€™m supposed to do or think or feel

CPTSD,Tips for Guilt and Shame Around Saying â€œNoâ€ When Dating?,"Hey all! I (25F) am recovering from some sex-related adolescent psychological abuse, a CSA, and two assaults in college. One of my biggest hurdles has been shame spiraling any time I have to say no to a man I pity and the toxic shame spiral that follows when I succeed.
 
Iâ€™ve gotten better recently and I know exposure therapy and continuing to date is the solution, but Iâ€™m still pretty early in figuring out how. Figured I would ask you all what strategies you use.
 
Optional Read: here are some examples of where Iâ€™m at:
 
â€¢  had heart palpitations and disassociation after having to cancel a second date tonight, shame spiraled about having led him on and caught him off guard by being too nice despite not being physically attracted to him
 
â€¢ considered it a big victory that I didnâ€™t sleep with him after said date
 
â€¢ considered it a big victory when a male friend who seemed interested in me but never made a move had to crash on my couch and I didnâ€™t initiate sleeping with him
 
â€¢ friends jokingly refer to it as the â€œ[My Name] Thingâ€ when they just sleep with someone because itâ€™s easier than saying no and going home or asking them to go home
 
â€¢ I have never managed to go back to a dateâ€™s house without sleeping with them, even though I usually donâ€™t want to, I just feel obliged ESPECIALLY if they pay
 
â€¢ I spend money I donâ€™t have on paying for dates so I feel less pressure to sleep with them but usually do anyway
 
â€¢ Was broken up with early last month for the first time and my brain short circuited because I didnâ€™t know how to identify my feelings, so I just filled my head up with his. I ended up thanking him twice, repeatedly expressing pity for him at having to break up with me and paying for his drinks"
CPTSD,Can you discipline yourself out of CPTSD/PTSD triggers? Trigger warning and Venting,"My psychologist told me that I should ""practice more discipline in catching myself when triggering or upsetting thoughts arise.""

I had asked for help in managing or eliminating seemingly uncontrollable memories and rumination when something similar to what my abusers did is presented to me.

It didn't leave a good impression on me and I thought she should have better advice than this, considering she knows the details of my past. I initially gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed that she may have meant using the concept of compartmentalization to help me with dealing with triggers or grounding techniques to keep myself calm and avoid spiralling and self harm, but really, I suggested those.

I'm open to the idea of adopting more discipline into my life. Just tell me how and what do I need to do. But let's be honest, I could get the answer to this easily by googling it. What I'm starved of is personalized actionable advice.

I could go on and on about how I was a parentified child, a makeshift mother and caretaker to my siblings and a partner and personal assistant to my parent but that won't mean anything to show that I have enough discipline. I feel as though she has given me this advice because they have painted me as some basement dwelling idiot living rent free, ignoring that I'm paying my own and helping my family with the costs. All because I didn't complete high school even though I had my own reasons (Assaulted during my first attempt at Uni qualifying exams, assaulted again at second attempt, mix that with an abusive and neglectful upbringing, no one believing me and a little CSA and SA. I ended up mentally crumbling, giving up and working dead end jobs so I can at least save and support the family). Yes I have a chip on my shoulder lol.

Professional help has me feeling jaded. I feel as though I'm better equipped to handle it all on my own. No attempts of diagnoses, no attempts of helpful programmes. I started self directed CBT/DBT/EMDR and Internal Family Systems via journaling myself because they were passing me around like a hot potato and have called the past three months ""progress"". Each appointment is just unactionable advice on top of unactionable advice. ""Have some hope"" is the best and most hilarious one so far.

I have lost interest in getting professional help. I've gone through therapists in the past and I could excuse them for their inability to deal with my issues, but I can't do that to a team of psychiatrists and psychologists. I can't give them grace or the benefit of the doubt, which makes me feel hopeless.

This isn't even the only instance of shady or possibly incompetent events happening here, I'll save it though and keep my mouth shut for my privacy.

What's the verdict? Should I shut up and just keep going? Stop complaining? Am I even right to be upset or is it just my ego clouding my perception of everything? I don't even know what I'm asking anymore lol, reply ""L"" in the comments if you feel my pain xD

Cheerio

Thank you for all the replies!"
CPTSD,What's real and what's trauma reaction,"Any good tips on how to tell what thoughts/ideas you have are actually the way you think/feel, and which ones are simply trauma reactions?  I've been married 12 years now and have been finding myself triggered nearly constantly.  It's to the point where I'm considering leaving because it's just so much work and I'm so tired of constantly fighting not only the normal battles and challenges everyone faces in marriage, plus the extra strong reactions to some of the stuff as a result of my PTSD (feeling constantly watched and criticized, feeling I'm not enough/not good enough.)  We've been in counseling for years and yet it still seems to be a struggle.   


Lately I've been fantasizing a lot about splitting up so I can live a much simpler life where I don't have to feel constantly triggered.  At the same time, I've always had the coping mechanism of ""disappearing"" or ""going away"" when under stress.  My pre-marriage life fantasy was buying a sailboat and simply spending my whole life drifting around.    


So, how do you differentiate when you're really unhappy with  situation and when you're just reacting from your trauma?"
CPTSD,Any first-gen immigrants here?,"
I moved to the US less than 3 years ago, and began my journey with cptsd only a year ago. This also coincided with me completing grad school and moving to west coast, ending things with an extremely abusive ex. 

I havenâ€™t returned home since I first came, and the last year especially has been incredibly isolating. Moreover, every time I try to give people a chance, I feel let down and this feeds into my depression and pessimism.


Iâ€™m not doing bad, per se, I have a cat, hobbies, no big financial issues. But I crave some genuine human connection and Iâ€™m not sure how to get that. I also find myself lost, without an identity here. ( everyone who lives in my area are Asians in tech, like me  )

In the rare occasions when someone is nice, I freeze up, I donâ€™t know how to move the friendship forward ( I am unable to convince myself theyâ€™d like me forward real ) and when something is planned, I often am too depressed to show up.


How to find myself? How to find friends? How to feel more alive?"
CPTSD,I reached a new level of sick,"After so many hurtful experiences of rejection, I decided to go for my childhood/teenage years coping mechanism. I purposely decided to get emotionally attached to a celebrity. It was a safe plan. I assumed she'd be like most of them - shallow and stupid. But no. I found out she's the most lovely human being I've ever seen and we also have the same interests, the same personality.

I never had any expectations. I know she'd never acknowledge my existence. I know she'll never know my name or develop the slighest interest in me. But I loved the fantasies I had in my head every night before falling asleep. An alternate reality where all my dreams came true and she's my partner, professionally and romantically.

Today I found out she's getting married and I'm wrecked. It feels like the day of my most traumatic romantic rejection all over again. I feel abandoned all over again. I feel like I really lost something. I feel sick to my stomach. I feel dizzy. I can't even breathe. I just wanted to rip my heart off so I never feel anything at all again.

Please, somebody help me. This fantasy was the only thing that was keeping my sanity. I know I'll never find a romantic partner because of my deformed face and my mental illness. Just say something nice. Just say something to make it stop."
CPTSD,was it all in my head the whole time?,"im gonna try not to make this too long. basically a few years ago i posted in an ED subreddit about how i couldnt exercise because i would think of my sister and mother teasing me about not exercising and start crying everytime out of shame and gender dysphoria. someone commented telling me about cptsd, and at first i was like Lol no, that's for people who went through real bad shit. but i checked it out anyways...and my eyes were slowly opened. i ticked nearly every single bullet on the list of cptsd traits. i think the main thing was emotional neglect.

anyways, i moved out as soon as i could, and i now live with my boyfriend (im 19). and im in college. it's absolutely wonderful, but whenever it's time to go back for the holidays, ill get really anxious and cry a lot in the days leading up to the trip ""home"". but especially this year, not much really happens anymore. my mom and sisters relationship with each other is so much better than it used to be, which was like daily screaming fights. my mom and dad should definitely be divorced, but it seems like my mom has matured an insane amount in the past couple years alone. we used to spend every single conversation talking about my sisters drug and alcohol abuse, or something else of a similar emotional burden, and i would bear the weight. i would talk her through it. i was there when she said she must have been a serial killer in her past life to deserve what my sister was putting her through...to her own child. i wasn't the easiest child, especially because i transitioned to male when i was 13, but god fucking damnit did i try to be easy. i made myself a breeze to deal with. i never told any of them anything. my mom i think suspects i had an ED, and she read my journal when i was 13 where i talked about wanting to die, but whenever she brings that stuff up now, all she says is ""you somehow figured that all out on your own"". 

im getting off track. but basically my parents, especially my mom (my dad has narcissistic traits and is kind of an alcoholic and no matter how much i try to tell my mom she deserves better treatment she doesn't listen to me and tells me at least he doesn't beat the shit out of me, something i heard a lot growing up) are much, much better and it no longer makes my heart sink to my feet when im with them. most of the time im happy to spend time with my mom, shes really funny and personable and chaotic. she also has really severe ADHD that was undiagnosed until last year, so i feel like that's part of it. she has matured immensely and while i am proud and happy for her, there's this aching void in my chest. i feel like i must have faked all of it. i was venting to my boyfriend about it the other night, sobbing relentlessly, and i asked him if i was being oversensitive and making all of it up. i asked him this because everytime i would tell a story about something that hurt my feelings aloud, it would dawn on me how stupid i was for getting hurt over it. he told me that as singular incidents, then maybe i would be being oversensitive, but compounded together over time it's hurtful. this kinda sent me spiralling even though i agree with him. 

im just so scared to be wrong. what if ive been oversensitive all these years? sure i isolated myself an insane amount, to the point that now i don't really know how to be a person, but in the end that was all my doing. sure, my mom and especially my dad are not the most emotionally reliable people, but if i really needed help i couldve gotten it. the issue was i didnt want help. i wanted to be left alone, but also i was literally 11 years old and its not my fault that therapist sucked and my mom didnt believe me when i told her so.

i just wish it was black and white so that i could have a proper statement, but things never are. ever since i was a kid i would fantasize about getting beaten up so that i could have something physical to prove my pain with. when i tell my boyfriend this he doesn't understand...i don't know. i still feel so hurt and sensitive all the time, although i think im getting better. i used to cry all the time when my boyfriend would accidentally say something with a slightly harsh tone, but i feel myself slowly understanding how normal people act with each other.

this isn't to say that my family is totally fine now, it's just....better. and i worry that i was just crying over it so i could feel bad for myself the whole time. idk. i know this is a common feeling but genuinely i had it so good, had everything i could want in terms of physical items....i feel like im the exception to the ""lots of traumatized people feel like theyre faking it"" thing. i fear it. i just hate that im STILL like this and theyre fucking Fine. i feel like i really need to get over it, but i cant. i wish they were worse so that at least my boyfriend might be able to understand me. but no one will ever understand me completely. sometimes that fact is what hurts the most. 

edit: i do not understand downvoting this i am sorry did i say anything wrong?? im just looking for support idk "
CPTSD,Trouble accepting it is trauma instead of 'just' anxiety,"Hi all! I've been struggling for years with sudden feelings of extreme anxiety when going places/seeing people but could never say what made me scared. It's been 7 years and although it has been making my life very hard I still couldn't name what it is that makes me scared. Which scares me more because I feel absolutely crazy for being scared at 'nothing'. I've been in therapy for anxiety for years and it hasn't made a difference other than that I now feel I am an anxious person. I identify with it as my core problem.

Since I wasn't making any progress whatsoever a friend of mine kept hammering me to read up on trauma, which I figured was useless since no way. I eventually gave in and read a lot of books like The Body Keeps the Score. It's been about a year and I now know I have trauma. Yet I can't feel it. It still feels like no, you have an anxiety disorder.

I've lived with a suicidal dad and a sick mom for years, so I know rationally it is probably true. But I just can't allow myself to say these anxiety feelings that have been ruining my life are due to trauma. That they are probably emotions due to being triggered. Yet I can't allow myself to say it's okay you are being triggered since in a way I'm like no it's just anxiety because you are a pussy. Since I am so used to living with anxiety as being my biggest flaw. Do any of you have tips for this?"
CPTSD,People seem to have feelings come up all the time,"...and I am dead inside â˜ ï¸

Please help my autistic self understand.

I hear things like ""think of X word...what feelings come up?"" Or ""what do you feel looking at this image?"" And it's like, an image of 2 lions cuddling. What comes up? Do people really have feelings while looking at the lion image? Am I that dead?

Or the fact that people get triggered by tv series...for me it's just, it's a series, I watch it to distract myself - *maybe* maybe if someone dies, I'll be sad. 

Also the anger. People have so much anger for small things. Where do they find all that energy?

Maybe I am missing out on the entire human experience

Edit: the one exception to the series thing is Pose. My god have I cried watching that series. You could really feel the actors' love. Maybe I have a heart after all"
CPTSD,Panic Attacks,"Iâ€™ve of course had anxiety my whole life. However after turning 25 it seems to be getting steadily worse - maybe because Iâ€™m in therapy and more aware of my body and other things? Anyways Iâ€™ve been in this funk of having heart palpitations everyday for over a week now, even went to the doctor. Iâ€™ve had panic attacks before but had one by myself at a large grocery store. Heavy chest which lead to racing heart, sweating, dry mouth, shaking, etc. I used logic and reason the whole time without success. Iâ€™m scared of public places by myself, specially places that arenâ€™t super familiar. Iâ€™m in therapy but my next session isnâ€™t until Thursday and I start in person classes on Monday. Feeling nervous and hoping people have some coping strategies on how to handle a panic attack when youâ€™re in the midst of it and logic/reason are out the window. Thank you, Iâ€™m hoping this intense anxiety will pass, I donâ€™t normally have it like this. Iâ€™m really hoping itâ€™s just a phase ðŸ˜ž"
CPTSD,I let my mom traumatize me,"My therapist said something that made alot of sense. I didn't have to do what my mom told me. I didn't have to steal for her, or bum cigarettes for her, I didn't have to lie about my step mother for her, or beat up my uncle for her. I could have said no. I let this happen to me, and I just need to get over it. I let her traumatize me. My mom was just a convenient scapegoat for my guilt. It is all my fault.

Edit: for those accusing me of rage bait. I'm sorry that Im not convincing enough for you"
CPTSD,constant exhaustion,"i was gonna journal about this but i have been finding solace in coming to this space where everybody has the same struggles and sharing my struggles as well, it is very validating.
i am so fucking tired of my family. i am exhausted of being treated like a second class citizen. i am exhausted of feeling like my safety is threatened when i try to speak up for myself and quite frankly i am just donâ€™t being here. i canâ€™t move out because i am 17 and whilst iâ€™m going to university this year september that is still immensely far away and i can feel all of my anger bubbling and coming to surface because of how frustrated i am. sometimes i invalidate how i feel because i see other people go through stuff and think theyâ€™re okay so surely my experience isnâ€™t my true experience, but since finding out CPTSD is a thing and like literally having all of the various symptoms, i feel like i can no longer ignore my feelings! idk if anybody gets like this sometimes but i am too tired of juggling so many responsibilities to come home and be abused and go back outside and do school work and interact and act like shit is sweet just to go back to people who i feel do not know me. i want to be more self assured, i want to live without the voice of my family in my head but i literally live with them! idk, iâ€™m angry. i hope everybody who is going through something similar feels validated bcz this shit is very hard and i see you :,)"

CPTSD,The first time I stood up for myself,"I was just reading someone elseâ€™s post about saying â€œnoâ€ to a parent and it reminded me of the first time I did and instead of putting it in their post I thought I would make my own.

My mom took advantage of me so badly it was outrageous - after my father died she asked me to quit my job (as an Executive Director of a nonprofit so not a throw away job) and take care of their house 2nd house. 

I spent almost a year living in a different town, still paying for my apartment in my home town and paying all the expenses at her house where I was working (unpaid) and I moved my daughter down with me but the school was so racist that she and my husband moved back to our home townâ€¦ 

I completely emptied her house and worked on it 7 days a week including fixing it up so fixing the Sheetrock in the basement my brother had broken, installing the flooring, finishing the heating vent system, finishing the walls, building a second bathrooms, re-doing old tile, and doing tons of landscaping work. I added 80-100,000 in value to that house and when I was done I moved back to my home townâ€¦ she went down there to pick up the rest of her stuff that I had packed up down there and you know what she didâ€¦ she complained that I forgot a pair of jeans there. 

She was always hyper critical so she started laying into me about how I have no respect for things and had left the house â€œtrashedâ€ And all that and I finally said â€œare you kidding me? I gave up a year of my life and worked my ass off for you!â€ That was the first time I ever talked back or spoke up for myself against her and I was 36. 

The work was great (my father taught me well and he and I used to work together on projects) so she never complained about that except color choices but my god those jeans here as if I had pooped in the middle of the floor."
CPTSD,I feel absolutely terrible for what happened to my partner,"Warning: Hey, this is a post with various doubts at the end, which is why I tagged it as â€œquestionâ€, but they are in regard of a very emotional situation, which makes this post sort of similar to a vent. I just wanted to say that, whoever is reading this, if you arenâ€™t in the mood for something like that, whatever the reason might be, I reccomend you not to read it. Thanks for paying attention to the warning!


My boyfriend of more than a year, who has CPTSD, is really my everything; heâ€™s the sweetest, most awsome human being Iâ€™ve hever met. We both make active constant efforts in order to keep our relationship healthy and happy. This involves a lot of honesty, so, naturally, weâ€™ve told each other about our pasts. His includes a lot of terrible abuse, which he, and no one, would ever deserve. I completely accept and understand the trauma heâ€™s gone through so I try to be as supportive as I can: I make sure to do constant research on CPTSD and communicate with him about the struggles he goes through because of it.

However, sometimes knowing all that heâ€™s been through really gets to me, which I guess is normal, but still hurts like hell. Whenever this happens I tell myself itâ€™s okay because he wonâ€™t ever be put in any similar situation again, he now knows how to identify abuse, unhealthy dynamics and how to get away from them, etc. And most importantly, he now has a support net, me, his parents, and his friends, who can and will help him in case heâ€™s ever in danger. Usually repeating this to myself helps, but sometimes there doesnâ€™t seem to be anything to help me make it hurt less. Heâ€™s a wonderful person, heâ€™s always been, and he doesnâ€™t deserve all what happened to him, not even one thing. Sometimes I wish it all happened to me instead, other times I feel guilty I didnâ€™t know him back when he was going through all that abuse so that I could help him somehow, which Iâ€™m aware is a completely irrational thought, which and I feel kind of selfish for having, but thatâ€™s besides the point.

I know I have to bring all this up to him and I will, eventually. Itâ€™s just that I canâ€™t help to feel like Iâ€™m framing myself as the victim when really heâ€™s the one who had to endure all that for literal years and who now has to cope with hurtful symptoms everyday. My questions are: is there anyone in this subreddit whoâ€™s gone through something similar? How can I deal with this feelings? And lastly, for people with CPTSD, how would you feel if your partner brought this up to you?

CPTSD,Best careers/industries for people with CPTSD?,"I have CPTSD from being raised by a narcissistic father and enabling mom. Iâ€™m  a high performing people please with fear of conflicts. Iâ€™m constantly in fight/flight/fawn. 

Iâ€™ve been working in corporate for close to 20 years, slowly and painfully climbing the ladder and always feeling like Iâ€™m burning out. My current job is horrible and I think I need to get out of corporate in general. Question is.. what would be a better job for people like us?"
CPTSD,"I [35M] am a depressed, inexperienced loser when it comes to sex and dating and I'm sick of it and want to change so so badly.","I posted this in some of the dating subs but I'm reposting it here because it's absolutely because of cptsd that I'm like this 

I'm 35 in a few short weeks and I'm fighting off the urge to despair every day that my dating life is....almost nothing. A single sexual partner that I met on Bumble and I couldn't get it up for her because porn ruined my dick, having used it as a substitute for the female affection I never thought I'd ever receive in life.

Watching my friends date and fuck and hook up at parties and clubs like it's normal gives me nothing but despair, depressed at the thought that I never had a dating or sex life in my youth.

I'm at the point in my therapy where I finally feel like I could possibly live free from all the protective behaviours that have made me so miserable but I don't know where to start or even think about how to overcome the hurdle of having zero experience in anything. I feel like the only thing that will fix me is a time machine that will take me back to being 18, tell myself to lose some fucking weight and get sleeping around.

I still want that sleeping around phase that I never had, but I'm at the age where everyone settles down and I don't want to miss out on the joy of exploitative sex, casual or not.

How do I reconcile this? Is there a chance for me to still be a manslut for a few years or even get into a normal dating routine at my age for the first time? OLD is a miserable dead end for someone not particularly photogenic like me (bit I don't think I'm ugly, still need to lose that weight tho).

Sorry to ramble, but it's all so extremely much and I just want to stop feeling like a fucking loser. Any advice? Tia."
CPTSD,"to end toxic shame spiral, you need to acknowledge youâ€™re allowed to want and need comfort/support","So Iâ€™m realising that I undergo into a toxic shame cycle when Iâ€™m faced with a problem.

So basically if Iâ€™m overwhelmed with problems, I feel like I just â€œshouldâ€ be okay and I donâ€™t ask for comfort/support from others. Then that leads to me getting more fucked up and then needing even more comfort but still being fucked up etc etc

So to solve this, the minute I identify that Iâ€™m having a hard time I need to acknowledge I need comfort and seek it out. So I decided I will reach out to support system when that happens?

What Iâ€™d need in those times would be reassurance that Iâ€™m a smart and capable human being and Iâ€™m not my trauma and that Iâ€™ll get through this. Basically timely reminders of this so that I know whatâ€™s the true reality. 

Itâ€™s almost unreal how realising this took me years and can help make my life so much better?"
CPTSD,denying myself basic human necessities,"does anyone else experience that they knowingly (and sometimes subconsciously) deny themselves basic human necessities? for example, despite experiencing hunger i do not eat, simply because i donâ€™t find it important enough and nor do i find myself deserving of it. this can also look like not keeping up with my hygiene or letting myself go through unnecessary discomfort, such as going out lightly dressed despite knowing that i will freeze. this is not due to laziness, i do this as a conscious choice. i canâ€™t figure out why i deem my needs so unimportant. i was not neglected as a child, but i experienced (still experiencing  some of it, but not as severe anymore) physical, mental and sexual abuse since i was a toddler. can anyone relate to this and is this a common theme within cptsd?"
CPTSD,"Iâ€™ve finally told one person the way I really feel, and have always felt, about myself","Today started off okay but then at some point I just started crying. It escalated and I was sobbing and just trying to get through my emotions on my own (the way I normally do). My sister heard me and asked what was wrong. I didnâ€™t tell her at first when she asked but I couldnâ€™t stop telling her to stop giving a fuck about me in my head. I eventually get to talking to her and it just comes out. My core beliefs have always been that I am worth absolutely nothing. Unworthy. Unloveable. A fat fuck who takes up space and that people worry about even tho they shouldnâ€™t. An insecure, worthless, incompetent, inadequate ugly piece of shit.  I didnâ€™t say all of the last part but still. And as I did so, I watched my sisterâ€™s face screw up multiple times like she was trying her absolute hardest not to cry. And even then, even now, I still didnâ€™t and donâ€™t understand why. I canâ€™t get the â€œwhy do you careâ€ out of my head. And it just makes my anger so much worse towards the people who have always made me feel this way- my parents. I even asked her what she got out of loving me. I donâ€™t have anything to offer to you. I donâ€™t have anything to give you. I cannot pay you back for your love and affection if itâ€™s genuine, and I never open up enough lest my pain and devastation be used against me at some point in my life to make me feel bad as itâ€™s always been.

I'm not talking about your basic ""tell me about a time you..."" type questions.

I'm talking about the kind that makes me feel like they are just trying to poke holes in me, like they need to figure out if something is wrong with my career and my choices.

My career has seem some varied work, but always within the field of data, databases, analysis, programming, etc. And every now and then some interviewer will talk about how I don't seem focused, even though the truth is that I like and enjoy all related work.

It just deflates me so much that people can look at the jobs that I've enjoyed doing and make me feel defensive about it.

Just curious if anyone out there can relate."
CPTSD,Mother fears I could let her down again after going no contact because she was mentally abusing me throughout childhood,"13 years ago (I'm now 39) I went no contact will my mother because she would still control me and yell at me, saying I do everything wrong. I didn't have a good childhood. My mother mentally terrorised me since early childhood and my father never helped me even though he had promised so many times. So for my own mental health that was quickly deteriorating at that point because of them I told them I needed a break and went no contact for a year. When I felt more stable I reached out to them and we talked about some of the things but not all of them because my mother tends to ""not remember"" what she said or did. 

For 12 years now I've been trying to work on a good relationship with them and even helped them in any way I could. Every now and then my mother would go back to her old habbit of yelling at me what a bad person I am and that I never helped them. I know it isn't true and most of the time she admits what a wonderful person I am for being there for them.

A couple of months ago they decided to move into the area I live in as I had asked them to so I could be there for them when they get older (my mother just retired). Since they're hete I do everything possible to make them feel at home and even inviting them to meet my friends so they can socialise (my mother didn't have friends for many years).

Recently I was going shopping with her and all of a sudden she pointed out that she was reluctant to move here because she can't be sure if I wouldn't let them down again and go no contact like once before. I was stunned and my anxiety level went up. She then said, she still doesn't think it was necessary at that time to go no contact and how much she had to suffer because of it.

I now feel like she actually didn't understand anything back then and I'm still the bad, selfish person to her. I can't back out now, they already moved here. But now it feels like a lot of pressure. I think she expects me to deal with all of her tantrums from now on. I'm feeling like that little cornered girl again, sitting in the corner of my room and getting yelled at for no reason.

Really had to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading this and maybe someone has a similar story?"
CPTSD,I regret staying alive,"Nothing has changed in 25 years. Ever since I was three years old I knew this planet was not my home. Melting, scorching, charring anything that can be good. This life and i are incompatible with one another. Frankly, I'm surprised I lived as long as I did. I did everything I could do to try to make things work. A mentally ill, poor, minority man. Incapable of anything. Destitute, devoid of any semblance of good or holy. I shouldn't have been born. Yet despite that I tried. In the end, I did. I'm not even welcomed in trauma and molestation support groups, on account of being a man. I have no home.

But that's okay, because in a few hours I can finally rectify this. I am going to my real home. I gave it all I had. I did. No more. All of the psychological trauma and horror I've endured, by letting myself live. This ends today."
CPTSD,My life is finally stable so im gonna tell my story,"(TW for basically every god damn thing under the sun)

This is 2 hrs worth of a tired dipshit writing about his shitty life and its not even all all of it and it has alot of shit humour and no grammar to be seen so read at your own risk or with alcoholic popcorn



Im in a relatively stable part in my life now so i thought it be best to tell my story and hey maybe someone will see all the shit i went through and feel maybe shits gonna turn out alright for them


Also im on mobile so the formatting will be garbage 


Alright so i guess the most logical start would be the literal beginning but my trouble kinda start even before i breach and cleared into a doctors hands, both of my parents had really really fucked lives that fucked them up a hell of alot 

My mom (and uncle) grew up being raped almost constantly by my grandmother's churchfriend's children when she was 5 up until around 6.5 maybe longer by boys that were (4-17) i cannot remember exact details as ive only really heard my mothers rare drunken ramblings and things id hear from her venting to either my father or me 

She also had to go through her parents having a divorce and not being able to actually get justice (till much much later in life) 


Now for my dad

My dad grew up with a complete abusive fuckhead of a dad and a schizophrenic mother  
He has told me many times that he didn't really feel like he had parents as he was fully independent at 5 (not by choice but by neglect) and rarely interacted with him outside  of abuse and he basically barely had any positive memories of them at all 

He even told me that as soon as he had enough mpney to move out he did and his parents would call asking for money and show up unannounced to ask for things like cigarettes or gas.



I know very little about my parents early relationship besides of starting from boinking for cigarettes and my mother cheating quite a bit (and also the fact that my parents thought lube was optional with anal but thats not really realated its just something that keeps me awake at night)




When my parents were around 18 they had my  brother Bread (its funny if you are me) and he turned out to be lvl3 in the autism skill tree and as incredibly unprepared uneducated and underfunded and often mentally unstable parents  dealing with a vastly misunderstood and often difficult mental mixup youd assume my parents would be royally fucked, but neverfear my dads incredible productive and extremely self distrutive ass is here as he work at somestime like 5 jobs up to 90+ hrs to support them all and pay off their depts from all the support and medical shit my brother needed which was damn expensive even playing the aboriginal card (im Australian).

But now a bit about bread he is a fucking absolutely prick and was extremely abusive to me from the  time i was born until maybe 2 years ago (mainly because i can kick his ass now but still hes improving), he has done numerous ludicrous things to me (nothing sexual dont worry my trauma aint go there)
Hes stuffed me into one of those toychest couches  and sat on it as i slowly suffocated while i screamed for help and tried to claw my way out with frail fingers

 (we were in a shrinks waiting room for my brother and my parents were talking to him in his office and unfortunately his office was  a thick wall away from the waiting room so my parents couldn't hear me) 

Fun fact the receptionist apparently saw a child being suffocated and didn't intervene so fuck her lol

Anyway after 500 damn words lets get to me, ya boy, ya star, the main attraction, razzmatazz to ya sadness 

When i was born it made my parents life exceptionally difficult as they basically had 3 kids with the amount of extra care my brother needed so they were basically running themselves to a thread so they took me to stay with my nan most of the time when i was growing up so they could both work and my mom could study

Growing up in my home i could tell that my parents were most of the time hanging on to threads in their sanity so i would do my damn best to be the best damn kid i could be

Buut to my child brain that just meant inconveniencing them only when there was absolutely no other way to get what i needed and hell sometimes i would starve myself for a day just so my parents wouldn't have to go out and buy me food as i knew money was always hella tight which what do you know lead to a fun little eating disorder 

As i said my brother was a complete asshat and led me to feel shit about basically everything about myself and feel worhtless and suicidal at around 5 and boy did that stunt my emotional growth

Now lets get to the fun stuff and talk about my school years





Ahhhh kindergarten, the land of glitter and glue and unfortunately for the town i grew up in booger sugar and iced lattes but instead of  latte it was children and instead of the normal use of the word ice it was the Australian one

My kindergarten years were a complete fucking blur but i remember seeing a girl i had a crush on bleeding from her pants (my innocent ass brought her the box of bandaids) and one of my class mates suddenly and without warning never showing up to school again and i had to go to this fun thing at a church that had a lamination filled table so i didn't really listen to what was going on

My nan tried to take to church alot more after all that stuff but damn was i always the first to jump outta my seat an barrel towards that baked heaven so much so that  i learnt most of my persuasive abilitys jsut trying to convince the nice old lady that baked them that i should just eat all of them because i was..... there

Then we get into prep with was relatively uneventful putside of a bomb scare and a couple kids popping up with bruises. But i did notice alot more of my friends didn't  wana hang out with me and they wouldn't tell me why and curiously it was only the ones that were aboriginal and darker skin then me (no im not doing a racism i get to what im yapping sbout)


Fun note around this time i lost sight in my left eye thanks to my idiot brother but i wont say how as its hella identifiable





Year 1 shit hit the fan at my home life with my parents separated and my brother being expelled from his first skill near the start of the year with him joining the school i was at which made the bullying which was only minor up until that point get exponentially worse and so did the rascism and euginism?? Idk what to call it

(Small context)
Aboriginals in Australia were basically raped through generations to make  a generation of ""white enough "" aboriginals to be place into white families and ""rehabilitated"" and thats led to a smallish section of aboriginal people seeing a mixed race aboriginal child *especially a white passing one* as  basically satan to the point they basically hated me more then just white people which most of them also hated


But year i had tk deal with alot of shit but it all went to an extreme one day when me and my brother were waiting for a friends mom to come pick us up when a group of aboriginal boys spotted us and one of them jumped on my brothers back a kneed his spine from behind


My brother even at this time was very tall fir his age (about 14ish and 6ft+) and only some of the older boy matched him in height but it would take about 3 of em to macth him in weight (no idea of weight around 150kg) he was a silent giant at school due to being constantly bullied and the like and  all he could do was stand there and say ""leave me alone"" in the Weakest voice ive ever seen from him and i watch them all spew every fucking insult they could think of ""white spastic ni&&a""etc

Then one through a full can of coke at his head and he started to bleed but still stood there as they tild him to ""drink up fat boy"" as the can busted hitting the curb anx spraying him and when i looked at my brother i saw him crying.


I saw the person i feared so much that i never stood withen arms reach fucking crying 

But i didn't feel any fucking catharsis or relief all i felt was a fuck tonne of anger to the point where i was about pass out and all i could get put was just vauge fucking warcries of just pleading/demanding they stop but all they did was juat fucking stare and one threw his water bottle at me and missed so i ditched it at his fucking head as hard as i could and then they all just rushed me and where clearly going to beat me if not outright kill me  but my brother just tackled the front one with a fucking thud

I cannot emphasise enough that these were lean fucking football and rugby players being tackled by what was essentially a double bass shaped frieght train made of fat and muscle from carrying said fat  

So these kids were sent actually flying and others that sat there stunned for a bit dogpiled and kicked the shit outta my brother as my toned 7 yo legs from fighting my brother who weighs 150 kg was kicking them each so hard in the nuts id swear i broke a toe on their pelvises 

The fighting continued for about 3 mins and ended with me being half conscious from being hit in the face by someone twice my size and my brother bleeding  a noticeable amount and the fighting only stopped because the principle had spotted us because we were in basically the front entrance

He called us up and called our mom who had to rush from work after being told we started a foght only to find her 2 sons bleeding in the waiting room being screamed at by a old (and very very racist) man and she saw in the nect room a nurse attending to what looked like a platoon of  idiots all holding their balls and  broken.... everything (150kg) and then stopping as the principal goes to demand that she punish us and she just unleashes all of her customers service worker and latina mama bear rage on this sack of shit so loud it probably brought me back to conciousness 
And she called the police to press charges on the boys and when she came back in the principle explained that my brother and i were suspended and my brother could no longer attend his senior camp trip (my mom paid 100 just because my brother wanted tl go to it just to not be at home due to my parents fighting and they made it happen

My mom asked fir the deposit back

Principal said he spent it

Long story short my mom had my uncles lawyer send a very legally threatening letter and suddenly 100 dollers suddenly appeared 






Alright i would continue but im very tired and its 7 and i havent slept and my bf is waking up so ima leave it here for now

Idk if i will continue but if people actually read this incoherent word vomit about an internet stranger then hell maybe i will

Thank you for anyone thats actually read this far and if you have any questions or anything you can comment or dm me and ill most likely answer them"
CPTSD,For Years I Told Myself ''My Abuse Wasn't Bad Enough'': My Story,
CPTSD,Resentment and hate,"When you feel someone has done you wrong, does anyone else struggle with letting go? 

I seem to get defensive, resentful, hateful and will just hold a grudge. Especially when no one is listening to the boundaries I'm putting down. 

I'm having issues with a member of staff, management have spoken with them to lay off me but then also asked them to apologise. Which one will be a forced apology but also when I said didn't want one, I just need space. Everyone seems to be ignoring this request. And by space I mean I don't want to talk to you unless it's work related. 

And now I'm just resentful and hateful and will do everything in my power to make their lives a living hell. What is this and how do I work through this hateful emotion?"
CPTSD,"Just move on, why canâ€™t you just move on, get past it or youâ€™ll never change.","Like itâ€™s that easy. Like if I was able to Iâ€™d already be doing it, like I exist just to feel like a burden and issue to others. 

Itâ€™s just so fucking ignorant when people who are supposed to care say these things. And how am I supposed to respond in any kind of way that isnâ€™t a feral version of me."
CPTSD,"whoever feels bad for over-sharing, read this:",">Sharing the traumatic experience with others is a precondition for the restitution of a sense of a meaningful world. In this process, the survivor seeks assistance not only from those closest to her, but also from the wider community. The response of the community has a powerful influence on the ultimate resolution of the trauma. Restoration of the breach between the traumatized person and the community depends, first, upon public acknowledgment of the traumatic event and, second, upon some form of community action. Once it is publicly recognized that a person has been harmed, the community must take action to assign responsibility for the harm and to repair the injury.  
>  
>Those two responses - **recognition and restitution** \- are necessary to build the survivor's sense of order and justice.

CPTSD,Everything drives me mental,"

I feel caged in





Stress definitely becomes overwhelming for me I guess I also feel caged in

I'm mostly drained because of new years and Christmas and how it makes me feel i also had a support nag me a little because i wouldnt show up but i feel like that just gonna be a normal reaction for i fimd when im around people,  especially dealing with a shit real estate and black  mold. I'm most likely to randomly lash out because of the overwhelming stimulation of everything. 

Im happy for my support i did tell that im just having that break week. 


But also it really hard for me to not be not stress dosent help im sleeping on the floor of the lounge room either, im surprised i haven't mentally exploded yet

I'm also struggling to keep my brain occupied and feeling like I'm always bored"
CPTSD,I feel like I'm being punished for turning in my abuser. I'm a mess..and was doing so well. Or as well as one can be with our kind of histories.,"I feel like I'm losing it. I'm even afraid to tell my therapist who I trust without a doubt about how I feel. And she had helped me immensely. Yet suddenly i am scared. 

My abuser of 14 years was my biological father. Our history like all stories is a complicated one, the only constant was the abuse (sexual). 

After many attempts to speak up, finally I truly spoke up and there was an investigation etc, etc. After 3 months he ( a school teacher) was arrested and there was a trial- teatifying broke me at 17. He went away for 13 years. 
Long atory short,  I went through a lot while he what I was made aware, also auffered as a pedophile in a state prison. 

I have been doing well the past 8 years give or take. Last year he died suddenly of stomach cancer. Alone, with no one. Until his last few days he was a full believer in Thoreau's belief that ""Men lead lives of quiet desperation "" and had always hoped to ""die alone in a cabin in the woods of upstate NY"" (he was a big climber and dollhouse maker).

Ok so ..basically I for some effed up readon feel like he's in sone way trying to punish or get to me onr last time. Even in prison he wrote me convoluted ""love"" poems. (Now many years prior).  He was an English professor who I admired with such fascination. I also now have my MBA in it as well. (So fucked up?) 

 But not I am actually sick, diagnosed, yada yada. 

Does it have to do with him or am I allowing my conscious or unconscious thoughts infiltrate my reality due to the still fear of him? 

Sorry this was a long rant. But i feel crazy. I know im not but the feelings are so intense..and a therapist who hasnt experiended trauma...they dont understand to tge extent we do."
CPTSD,Is what I am experiencing abuse?,"A bit of back story before my question. I'm F, mid 40's. My mother left when I was two. My father raise me until I left home at age 19. He was incredibly emotionally and mentally abusive. Yelling, screaming, smashing the mirrors off his truck, very angry man. Punishments of standing in the corner for entire weekends, forced to eat my vomit. There is so much more.

Now, to my question. I have a 19 year old son who literally loses his actual shit when playing video games. He yells, screams, throws things around he gets so mad. He knows it gives me anxiety and why- it brings me back to trauma of my childhood with my father. He knows, yet he does it everytime he plays video games even when me and my husband have told him if he can't control himself he needs to stop playing.

Is what my son is doing also a form of emotional abuse? It's annoying to my husband, but effects me in a much different way where I need to either leave the house or blast music and cry.

I appreciate your thoughts, thank you."
CPTSD,This community isnâ€™t safe for minorities,"Iâ€™m making this post after the responses I saw to one post last night and quite a few Iâ€™ve seen over the past month. Every single time someone who is a racial minority, queer, or physically disabled speaks about their experiences in this community, they are shut down and forced to face more of it. The worst part is the mods have done nothing to actually deal with it from what I can tell.

I understand that this sub is most likely majority white, non-queer, people who arenâ€™t physically disabled, and etc but itâ€™s still frustrating. People are so uncomfortable discussing intersectionality, privilege, and race here that theyâ€™d prefer to just chase minorities out. This is a problem and it needs to stop. The mods need to step up too. Yâ€™all need to be stricter and harsher with enforcing this stuff because you are isolating a large section of this community.

It is hugely triggering. Being a minority is a lived experience that is full of trauma from the day you are born. You can not exist as one without having it. I have seen so many people have to delete their posts and try to defend themselves against bigoted abuse here because they thought they could safely talk about their feelings and trauma. They canâ€™t though. A lot of people here need to sit on their discomfort that is brought up when a minority talks about what it is like and how traumatizing it can be and do actual self reflection before responding. We are all traumatized and struggling here. We do not need to further harass, traumatize, and abuse PoC, queer people (especially trans people bc some of yâ€™all really donâ€™t like them here), physically disabled folks, people with pdâ€™s, and more. Be nicer yâ€™all. Iâ€™m gonna take a break from the internet now because I did not want to start my day this way

EDIT: Some of you need to relax when it comes to personality disorders in the comments. You shouldn't be discriminating against them under a post explicitly about bigotry and discrimination being a problem here. Do better. Not everyone with a personality disorder is bad. Statistically, they are more likely to be victims of violence and abuse than abuse others. It's a stereotype. I know a lot of you are hurting because of someone who had one. That doesn't make ableism okay though"
CPTSD,Did Patrick Teahan's family toxicity test,"I have known for a long time that it was bad. Though, there were no drugs, alcohol and all that stuff, both my parents are traumatized and both abusive in different ways (father overt, mother is a permanent martyr). Lots of enmeshment trauma and emotional incest. 

Due to lack of outright signs of pathology like drinking, drugs, repetitive physical violence I knew that it was bad but thought (perhaps like everyone here) that it's ""not that bad"".

The score of the test which was 85/100 (extreme toxicity) sunk in for a bit. Yes, it was THAT BAD. And I though that ACE score of 3 wasn't really that terrible..."
CPTSD,When youâ€™re feeling so low,"I feel like Iâ€™ve fallen into the deepest, darkest hole that I canâ€™t get out of. Came swiftly and strong, I was doing ok just earlier this week.

What kind of things do you do when youâ€™re feeling this way? I had therapy today but wonâ€™t have it again for 2 weeks because sheâ€™s away.

Just feeling really really awful. And I still have to be semi functional because kids."
CPTSD,Has anyone tried Patrick Teehan's online courses?,"I was thinking of buying a couple of his online courses, specifically the ""Overcoming the Toxic Family System"" course. "
CPTSD,I know how I feel is wrong but I cant help it,"I saw an article today about how The UK police has initiated an investigation into the alleged gang-rape of a 16-year-old girl's avatar in a virtual reality game. 
And honestly it pissed me off and I know it shouldnâ€™t have and that I should be empathetic for this girl and Iâ€™m trying it just hurts though.
I know itâ€™s wrong of me to think this but she couldâ€™ve taken her head set off and opted out whenever she wanted to. She was at home safe unable to be physically harmed which both are luxuries that I and so many others never had and on top of that police are taking this more seriously then they do almost all IRL rapes it just feels like a big fuck you and a mockery to victims of this IRL.
This has all been a bit triggering for me."
CPTSD,EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SHAME,"All trauma is somehow related to shame. Shame is what keeps us from expressing our emotions fully when we need to. Children are raised from shame, society is built on shame. Itâ€™s all shame!!! I am so sick of it. Trauma is the disconnection from our true authentic selves- and why canâ€™t we express our true selves? Due to shame!!! All humans are more or less traumatized, we all numb through different types of distractions and addictions. Why did our parents treat us badly? Or why couldnâ€™t anyone hold space for us after a horrible event? Because of shame, because how they were raised by their parents and the parents before them. If we want to end the trauma cycle and heal we need to end the shame cycles of society. How?? I donâ€™t freakin know. But for starters, donâ€™t bring on more shame onto others and donâ€™t accept it from anyone. Tell yourself â€I accept you, all of youâ€ a million times a day. Just needed to say it."
CPTSD,The change between having them here and not is so drastic,"I couldn't get out of bed all day, I kept sleeping and crying and I couldn't wake myself up, I could only at best use the phone sometimes or throw a ball for the cat to bring back. Then my boyfriend (distance relationship) came for a visit for a few days. I still felt bad, but he helped me wake up, he helped me do things I wanted. Still, we wanted to go outside but I just cried and couldn't go, but I could go see doctors. I needed many naps and time alone, and I couldn't move much. But even so, I felt living was worth it.

The moment they left I went full back to being unable to do anything. I live with mom but it's so different with her. She's not even bad she even tries to help but she doesn't know how.

I can't be better only when someone is there to support me. I have to do my best right now too but I seriously can't. Nothing feels worth doing, I just want to keep sleeping. I don't know. I feel bad complaining because I shouldn't, because there's people trying to help me, but I don't know how to get better.
When the physiotherapist or disability assistant come lately I can't even face them, I just corner myself, tremble and hiss."
CPTSD,How do you show yourself compassion/forgiveness when you get triggered?,"I talked to my sister (she's not abusive but has very black or white thinking at times) and I notice I got really anxious and sort of fawny when I spoke to her, because she feels really strongly about things I don't and I felt sorta pressured by her to take on her worldview ;an unhelpful habit I have (she gave off a defensive vibe which made me nervous).

&#x200B;

I am kicking myself a bit for not noticing that and falling back into habits of overextending, not setting boundaries with subjects that are uncomfortable for me, and going ""lawyer mode"" because she felt very strongly about some current events and she behaves a bit black or white which is triggering.

I hate when I feel like I self abandon or people please

**How do you show yourself compassion and forgive yourself? I am finding it very difficult, and I feel like I can only feel good if I'm not relapsing into old ways**

CPTSD,Can't accept romantic love at all - not able to progress,"Context: I'm a CSA survivor that's just recently coming to terms with my abuse. 

I've always felt that I had some type of arrested development throughout my growing up years. Even now even through I'm almost 30 I've never loved anyone. I don't think. I don't even know what it is.

For the longest time, the biggest tragedy in my life was that I felt I couldn't experience romantic love. It hadn't happened for almost 30 years. Why now?

Last year January was the first time I saw that a few people were interested in me romantically. I couldn't accept that and they ended very badly as expected before they even began.

Just a couple of weeks ago a guy asked me out for an exclusive relationship after talking, meeting for months - to which I said yes. Now he's being very loving, understanding and expressive but I just get very uncomfortable with that. 

He says he misses me? I don't miss him. I feel like I don't know him enough to miss him. I like spending time with him once a week and I like texting him. But I don't know if I miss him? I feel like he likes me more than I like him. Which is great.

But I feel like there's something within me that I need to resolve so that I can accept his love/care. I don't know what to call it. I feel like I'll want to take this relationship at a snail's pace because I don't think I'll be able to give him what he wants. 

I don't know why I'm feeling so distant from him even though he's right now the only one I have (besides family). No friends no social circle. And he's not pushy either. 

I am already in therapy. Regular talk therapy. It's great for venting but not for solutions.

TDLR: Anyone else who's struggled with accepting romantic love and found some way to get past this issue?"
CPTSD,i misunderstood so badly i feel like i've been living in a different world.,"two years ago, give or take, i (21m) met a guy on tinder. we went out, i wasn't sure, but i didn't want to let him down, so i stuck around. when it got too much and i couldn't understand why i didn't *""feel""* anything i broke down and broke up, even though we weren't really dating yet. maybe we were. i honestly don't know anymore.

he was about to give me such a sweet gift, a film roll of the photos we'd taken at a nature reserve earlier that day. i crushed him under my heel, it felt like, even if it hurt me too. 

then i found out i'd contracted syphilis. i'd been having unsafe sex before, during and after talking to this guy, and i lied to him about it. i've never been more guilty about anything in my life than that. i wasn't honest much then.

i sent a letter explaining the situation. to my surprise, he actually replied. and we talked, got back in touch, met again. and it fell through, again. i didn't understand, i didn't know why i was so terribly caught up in how we seemed so DIFFERENT. and then i learned i had ocd on top of the cptsd. and that sent me into a terrible spiral that culminated in last night.

i'd sent a letter maybe a week ago. no response. given that we'd exchanged letters back and forth before, even and especially ones from him out of the blue, i thought it was just a matter of time. and when i couldn't wait anymore, i went out to what had been our spot to reminisce, and then decided to stop by his house to ask to talk. just to talk. 

turns out that was the most tone deaf fucking thing i could've chosen to do. i consider myself generally pretty emotionally competent, empathetic, with common sense, but i talked to his mom who he's not out to and texted him through her phone asking him to text me. what the fuck was i thinking? 

when his sister got home, the one he was closest to, who i'd met and talked to briefly before we stopped talking the last time, she acted so nice i couldn't believe it. it didn't feel right, i sensed something off, but i wanted to believe she really would pass on the message that i wanted to talk. i wanted to set things right. that i was sorry for all the hurt and confusion and commotion i'd caused but i just wanted to check in and offer myself up in all the healing i've done in the past 2 years.

instead, i drove home and got a call from her. i was exorbitantly high at the time trying to dodge the pain and it just came crashing down on me when she yelled at me to stay away and get out of his life if i really care.

i feel shattered into pieces, but worse, i feel like a fucking asshole for hurting him, *again*. she threatened to fight me if i ever showed up again. i don't blame her.

i'm just in a daze right now. i feel like i've been living in a fantasyland where i'm the only one who exists, or something. i just needed to get this off my chest. it hurts that i thought he'd understand, having cptsd too, but that's my own pain to deal with. thanks if you read this far. peace."
CPTSD,Coalition for Responsible Home Education on Insta,
CPTSD,feeling off post medical procedure even though i don't remember it,"i just had a colonoscopy and endoscopy; i have csa trauma as well as trauma related to having undergone a vcug as a child, so i was really nervous about how this would affect me.

i kind of expected to be crying and shaking after coming out of sedation, but i was mostly fine? i wasn't confused, i'm not sore, and i was under for the entire procedure so i don't remember it at all. went through the whole discharge rigamaroll, got some food, joked with the nurse. but i still feel kind of...off. just, subtly upset? moreso as time passes. it feels different from usual when i'm triggered, where it's in an instant and there are flashbacks and i'm terrified. i just feel kinda bad. and idk what to do with it"
CPTSD,obsessively trying to run away from home at 2 years old..?,"when i was around 2 or 3 years old, i lived in this house with my mom and my dad. i would try to run away all of the time, obsessively. all the memories from there are just me crying and running away. i would run out the door then hide behind a shed, i remember specifically what it looked like, i would hide behind it, mom would scream from the window or door. 

running away from home at 2 years old is not ""normal"" right? 

i am asking for reassurance because it matches up with the fact i were being psychologically tortured by my mom and trafficked by family members, it would make sense why i was trying to run away. "
CPTSD,Traditional psychotherapy isn't cutting it,"I am so frustrated. I am really suffering, really feel trapped, have regressed and lost skills, and what's available to me tries to get at the problem in the wrong way. So much thinking and theories and structural reforms, but I still feel lost and scared. The traditional way to deal with patients who aren't getting better is to gaslight them into thinking that they aren't really trying hard enough or, much worse, that they prefer to suffer. I have completely exhausted myself, researching psychology and philosophy and medications and modalities, but I am severely limited in what is available and what I can afford. 

There has to be another way. There **are** other ways, but I'm a Westerner in poverty with no religious history and an inability to submit my will to authority figures. There are very few avenues besides the Big Three theological camps with smatterings of Westernized philosophical traditions from other countries or New Age flimflam. There's got to be something else, but I'm too brain dead-tired to seek them out. I'm going to languish and fade away if I don't find my way out. I'm feeling a little foolish in saying that some treacly motivational video featuring Jim Carrey's words actually penetrated my brain fog somewhat, and although I am dubious about how he arrived at his supposed insights, the idea that thinking harder is not the way towards a better life is really appealing to me. 

Spirituality is almost never talked about because of the pervasiveness of the hypocrisy of the Big Three and their derivatives and of the visible charlatans of the New Age realm, but I believe that there is out there more hidden paths to 'better' that don't have a mass market presence. Spirituality has become a commodity and status symbol for so much of society that it's hard to find the places where it's practiced as a method of true transformation.  

The focus on what is wrong, the focus on the mental makeup of personality, has made me more stuck. I think what I really need is a village to live in, a community to be a part of, a place where there is a presumption of my worthiness *that doesn't come from Abrahamic religions' brownie points brainwashing*. But those kinds of places don't exist, not with prejudices and constraints. 

What I need is a framework that lets me relax and not guard, that lets me dream without limit, and to take leaps of faith knowing that I will not be destroyed. Does this exist? It has to exist!

I think I just have to find more energy and look harder, but the complexity of being a fragile looney forever complicate even the tiniest step."
CPTSD,The purest white is darker than the blackest night,"How am I supposed to learn to trust again, if I have been hurt by the ones who I trusted most, the ones who were supposed to stay by my side, even my own family? How am I supposed to properly vet people and trust my intuition if I have been most hurt by the ""sweetest"" people, the ones who I knew for years? At least from bullies and stereotypical abusers you expect it from them, but if its from people you were vulnerable with, people you truly loved, it is way more painful in my opinion. They know where to hit you where it most hurts. It's been years yet I feel like I now just carry this scar that impacts the way I live, and I legit don't know how to connect with others anymore. I don't know how to trust people, how to interact without this anxiety gnawing at my core... Every time I open myself I feel like I get burned, and I convince myself that I will eventually get hurt and betrayed all over again."
CPTSD,Sober up before diagnosis is taken seriously?,"Has anyone been told that you need to be sober for 6 months before the diagnosis is official?  If so did it change anything?

There seem to be two therapy ideas: 

1) that treating the trauma should cause self medicating to naturally stop and 

2) substance abuse mimicks mental health conditions so we really donâ€™t know what is going on with the brain until other substances are long out of the picture.  I.e triggering and hyper vigilance is also a hangover symptom for daily drinkers.  Or reading into micro emotions is a weed thing."
CPTSD,Fate is not real,"I knew that my 41st year on earth was going to be detrimental. It would test the very fabric of my existence. And it did. For years, I touted that I was going to put a bullet in my head on my 40th bday because I didn't want to go over the hill. My younger brother beat me to it. At 27 he used a Desert Eagle to end his life. Four years later, mom bled out in the hospital. She'd thrown a tantrum because her son in law was not moving fast enough for her liking. The screaming caused a rupture in her throat and she drowned in her own blood. 

My brother's suicide hit me like a ton of bricks. It created a huge sense of urgency inside me to find protection from the rest of my family. I knew it wouldn't take much to shatter the fragile dynamic inside my family unit. One of us kids killing themselves was overkill 9000. I knew my mother was on a timer and she'd be dead soon as well. Her trail of destruction on her way out was something to behold. My father enabled her the entire way. Buying her wine, giving her his pills, paying for her lawyers, covering her tracks. My sister did the same as much as she could.

So when 40 came and it was time to shoot myself (according to my own time line) I couldn't do it. I'd already lost everything and survived. Surviving was all I'd done, and I didn't want to go out like that. Not to mention, my ex-wife would get the house to herself and I couldn't allow that. By then, I'd spent enough time with out my mother in my life to understand that she was keeping me in trauma. Her dying words? ""I'm sorry I won't be here to take care of you."" To her grave, she was self centered. To her grave, I was centered on her.

It's been over a decade since my brother took himself out. I still struggle with survivor's guilt. I have no doubt my mother played a huge role in his demise. I still struggle with guilt and shame because I know his death was the catalyst for my healing.

I stand as a survivor today, not a victim. My battles are in my head, no longer in my real world. Every day I grow stronger and more confident. But I still get bothered as all fuck sometimes by days past. I can see the forest for the trees and I have a deep desire to burn it down."
CPTSD,Realised I might actually be the dramaâ€¦what now?,"Iâ€™ve got a long history of varying types of trauma, as do a lot of people, but I really hadnâ€™t realised how it manifested. Iâ€™ve always thought of myself as really self aware, my therapist said she didnâ€™t know how to help me or what to say because of my self awareness. And I really do try to analyse my behaviour a lot. 

My issue is I have these insane mood swings, and itâ€™s almost like I forget the bad parts of these mood swings. Multiple people in my past have said itâ€™s like treading on egg shells with me and I could never understand why, it made me really mad actually. Iâ€™ve been called a whole host of names and been accused of being all sorts of things by old friends and roommates. I just assumed these people were A holes and cut off nearly everyone I know. But now I live with a friend who definitely isnâ€™t an A hole. I ignore them constantly, and get really angry over a whole bunch of stuff. Everything triggers me. And turns out Iâ€™m total and utter control freak. However I canâ€™t actually speak up or say whatâ€™s bothering me, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m physically incapable. Iâ€™ll spend weeks / months planning how to bring something up and I just canâ€™t. I go through all the possible outcomes in my head and I just canâ€™t face it. But the annoyance / frustration of these things doesnâ€™t go away, so of course it just builds up and up constantly, Iâ€™m mad at people and they donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m mad at them (well they probably do because of my moods and behaviour). Every roommate I have had I do not speak to now even if we were close friends before, I really thought they were all fully to blame bc they did have their own problems for sure (way too much to divulge rn).  But now Iâ€™m thinking that was kind of a combination of them and me being â€œproblematicâ€ hence why it never lasted long. This current living situation has lasted but I feel like screaming and running away, Iâ€™m constantly having fits of anger and punching my walls. Itâ€™s silly but I want everything my way, I canâ€™t cope when Iâ€™m not in control of everything and Iâ€™m now going through these frustration loops and trying to find other ways to regain control like extreme calorie restriction (didnâ€™t know thatâ€™s what I was doing until I told a MH professional). 

So I guess my question is, are some of us just not able to live with others? I have an aunt that has always refused to live with anyone and has never really had a partner and it seems right for her. 
I feel like living with others / friends is something I keep trying and it never ends well, I know Iâ€™m at least part of the problem and sometimes the whole problem. I think I want to live alone but the friend I live with had made a lot of comments about enjoying living together, but this was before the last few months where Iâ€™ve basically locked myself in my room. It just seems itâ€™s impossible for me to get close with people without me finding them really frustrating and distancing myself, at which point Iâ€™m just like an angry bitter little goblin that theyâ€™re scared to interact with. 

Open to any advice or just to talk about it with anyone who feels the same, thanks in advance :)"
CPTSD,After many years of therapy i finally got a diagnosis of CPTSD,"Hi 
I am new to this community and for someone who suffered a lot of trauma in her childhood and adolescence constant physical abuse and emotional abuse I want to know how does someone live with CPTSD 
What helps you calm ur triggers ?"
CPTSD,This community is the best and most knowledgeable community I know,"People are very holistic in their thinking here which I find very rare. Not even other mental disorders of physical illness group have this understanding. To be holistic is the only way to view ones condition and it gives extremely valuable information and understanding of one self and the world. 


I also think that the people who have CPTSD is a certain type of people so we have more in common that one can imagine.


Anyway, keep being you."
CPTSD,This news story is triggering me so bad.,"Every time I see something about Jeffrey Epstein & associates come up on social media/news I feel extremely triggered and angry. Everything about that case reminds me so much of my abuse. My father is extremely wealthy (makes like 10mil a year) and used to live in Palm beach which is where Epstein was arrested/used to live. I grew up around a bunch of wealthy creep men with addiction issues. I Fast foward to when I was 13, my father's girlfriend (personality very similar to Ghislaine Maxwell) starts grooming me. This woman in her 30s is my ""best friend"" and buys me anything I want with my father's money, treats me like an adult. I also found out later she was trying to seduce my teenage brothers. By 14 she was feeding me extremely strong alcoholic drinks, and would let men at bars hit on me. That's how my first kiss happened when I was 14, a man shoving his tongue down my throat in a bar. How could NO ONE notice or care that a child was being abused at their bar/restaurant? Why did she always get away with everything with no questions? I remember once she took a photo of me with one of the men we met, and then a few days later she had his ID in her purse. She was probably extorting him for money, right? There's so many layers to this abuse & exploitation and I'll probably never truly know the extent as to everything that happened. I just feel so sick and angry at this whole thing. I tried bringing it up to my father a few years ago and he didn't really care, in his head 14 year old girls are basically adults and I was just being a "" wild teenager"" and I probably enjoyed the attention. I just feel so sick, angry, and outraged by all the people in the world that think the abuse of teenage girls is not a big deal, that Epstein's victims were ""bad girls"" and that no one ever truly gets punished for their crimes. I'm sick and tired and angry. These experiences when I was in middle school primed me to be groomed by a 50 year old man in high school, and all these things have royally fucked up my brain. I'm 24 now and it feels like my sexuality was stolen from me (I have huge problems with intimacy with my husband) I can't trust other people, I always feel like I'm being manipulated or lied to. I hate my father and I'm no contact with him. I hate the fact that no one cares about my abuse. I hate how much teenagers are sexualized and how in many places around the world it's ""normal"". I hate the ""lolita"" trope. I hate how rich men travel to impoverished countries to rape children and barely anything is done about it. I hate the ""teen porn"" category and how it's the most popular. I hate all of it and I just want to escape this world. I look at my cousin who is 14 and I can't believe that was how young I was. She is protected and safe because her family actually cares about her. She is allowed to develop normally and everything was robbed from me. For what? For money, for some sick satisfaction? Maybe I should ""get over this"" because I was never raped (I think?) so I it couldn't be that bad. But I can't get over it, I can't stop being angry and I want the whole world to know who this woman is, I want to destroy her life."
CPTSD,"Breakthrough: Feeling the Feelings and Now... Elation, for I'm Able to Grow Insane Appreciation for Myself and Achievements","It's very late here but for the past 2 days I had been struggling so much with envy regarding opportunities. It really, *really* hurt, like actual physical pain, because I had to work so bloody hard and this person I envy got it just because he was there.

Anyway, I chose to feel it, sometimes just laying down in so much freaking pain.

If you've ever done something like that, you get it.

I apply many techniques from Miriam Greenspan's *Healing Through the Dark Emotions* and finally I got the breakthrough, epiphany of how, actually, the opportunity I felt so painfully envious about is almost nothing to what I've received and accomplished.

Financially, it's about a quarter.

So, like... truly the point of envy is rooted in being unseen, especially after hard work, just lack of that in general combined with your good ol' Asian ""Is this going to improve my Face? Is it braggable enough?""

But, my, I found a new whole appreciation for my past and accomplishments, and turning two years of many, *many* struggle, challenges, and actual mental breakdowns into something really beautiful, meaningful, that I genuinely feel super proud of.

Well, I suppose the butterfly is finally born.

Yet I had to let myself got dissolved as a caterpillar in a cocoon.

May we all move gently and peacefully towards more healing and health."
CPTSD,"Unearthed a repressed memory and realized how a lot of my physical abuse was dismissed as ""roughhousing"" :[","When I was young, my dad and I would play wrestle often. Though it would regularly get out of hand. If I felt a painful twist or couldn't breathe because he was crushing my chest or neck, I had to cry and scream to stop or he would just continue. He'd make excuses for this by saying things like ""If you really couldn't breathe, you wouldn't be able to say that"" or ""you need to toughen up, that was nothing."" It dawned on me that he'd initiate ""wrestling"" a lot more often if he was angry about something I did recently. Seems like it was just an excuse to hurt me in a way that could be excused as roughhousing between a father and son to make me feel like I'm weak for being hurt :\[ 

Not much of a point to this post honestly, just wanted to vent and share incase someone had similar experiences."

When that day comes, you'll look back to all you past troubles with a sense of peace and contentment you previously couldn't even imagine was possible.

Everything will come together in ways that will restore your belief in magic and humanity, and you'll realize the darkest past of your story turned out to be stepping stones. 

Stepping stones that were rugged, spikey, abrasive, bothersome, hellish, gruesome, wrenching, crippling and foul beyond words, which you never thought you could possibly made it through. 

**But you did, and you have, and you will. And part of you already knows it from across time and space. One day you will be a survivor rather than a victim. And  that day already happened a long while back. It was the day you were born. You just did't know it yet.**

CPTSD,"Reminder: it really was that bad (in fact, it was probably worse)","I know it's super common for people with CPTSD to question whether what they went through was really that bad, especially if it didn't involve explicitly illegal or taboo acts. This is just a reminder that it if it was bad enough to give you CPTSD, it really was bad. Terrible, even. The fact that you survived is honestly incredible. If you're having trouble moving past it, that makes sense. You went though things that would break even the strongest person. 

The voice in your head saying that it was nothing and you should just get over it is not a voice that is invested in your healing. Your pain is real. Your trauma is real. You aren't being oversensitive or dramatic. What happened to you was wrong, and it wasn't your fault."
CPTSD,Prolonged hypervigilance,"My mom was decently physically abusive when I was a child. It ultimately peaked with her strangling me and within a year I gave her an ultimatum: hit me again and youâ€™ll never see me again. And she never did it again for 10 years. Then at thanksgiving, we were discussing wedding planning and she disagreed with me on something and she slapped me. 

It wasnâ€™t hard or anything. It didnâ€™t leave a mark but it definitely stung. She even laughed when she did it because she claims she was â€œjokingâ€. And no one in the room (my dad and sister) even flinched. And in an instance, I was launched back into my trauma like never before. 

Itâ€™s been over a month and Iâ€™m still not sleeping properly. I find myself extremely anxious while at work or with friends. Iâ€™m always looking over my shoulder because I â€œsenseâ€ someone is behind me but no one is there. Iâ€™m fighting with my fiancÃ© more than ever before. I go into full on fight mode with him, even when things are minor because I feel like the only way to be safe is to attack. 

I canâ€™t keep going on like this. Iâ€™m working with my therapist but itâ€™s so hard. Talking about it obviously retriggers emotions. I find myself almost having flashbacks during sessions. It doesnâ€™t feel possible that this reaction can still be related to the slap a month ago!"

I looked at the mirror today and I realized I am trans. I am not just a bit nonconforming...I am really trans.

I can only be seen for who I am when I am being trans. I get a ticklish feeling at the thought of acting in my daily life as the half-female half-male creature that I am.

I mean, I can be masculine? And *actually* identify as something different than women? Whaoo! Makes my head spin just considering this thought.

I can be me?? Shit!!

CPTSD,Residential or Inpatient Treatment Program for CPTSD but no addiction,"I've been desperatly searching for months for a residential program or inpatient program for cptsd but they all center around addiction and co-occurring substance use disorder's (which I do not have), I'm 50 and at the point of complete paralysis from CPTSD from my childhood and then one trauma on top of another my entire adult life.

CPTSD,Struggling playing with toys,"(Copy/Pasted and edited from my other post from mental health)

Does anyone else struggle when it comes to playing with toys? 

I have a 4 year old and she loves to play with toys. At first, I guess I didn't realize I had an issue. We'd play for hours, it was fun. My daughter would have a blast. I didn't realize until later I would dissociate more than normal the entire time and get so into the characters that I'd stop thinking of them as characters and dolls but they would basically reframed as me in my brain to the point I'd feel the full emotions. Like, if they were sad, betrayed or if someone broke up, I would feel as if it was psycally happening and react, even getting to points where I end up crying or angry. There were days I'd even lay in bed at the end of the night and re-feel/cry over the events, not as me, but thinking as if I was still the toys and daydreaming for hours about the made up story, still as if I was the toy.

I've definitely tried to watch and be more aware of how I feel while playing with toys... But It seems like it begins happening every time. It's definitely impacted some of my relationship with her as I can't do long play sessions with toys.

Luckily, any game where I don't have to change characters and I'm myself, I do fine with even If I still get into the story more than others.

I plan on being it up in therapy. I'm currently switching to a new one, yay US mental healthcare, but I was just curious if anyone else has similar experiences."

Her anniversary is coming up on the 12th of January, it's only been two years. She ended up in a coma which was traumatizing to see in its own right. It's affected me greatly, yet it doesn't control my life. My life isn't great, but I can't seem to bring her up or talk about her without criticism. I find it hard to feel understood by people I thought would. Do I need to get over it? I don't want to. I want to be able to feel sad this time of year, and the rebuttals push me toward despising people to the endth degree. It doesn't control my life, but it makes me sad every now and again.

CPTSD,Just dealt with a huge trigger,"I was raped by my ex for two years straight in my teens, so getting hit on by a patient as a housekeeper was extremely triggering. Saying things like ""you know, the bigger you are the more there's to love"" and ""come 'ere, when you leave your boyfriend come find me sugar"" is just, ðŸ¤®

Today I was put back on that area and saw the patient was still in the room. Couldn't text my bosses to request a male housekeeper to do his room because my service sucks, I had to go ask workers on the floor and was met with severe judgement. I pushed through it, not backing down and eventually got what I needed.

I'm sick and tired of the judgement. That was really the worst trigger. Not even being hit on by an old man. But being judged because I was uncomfortable with it..."
CPTSD,Is anyone terrified of becoming an abuser?,"The thought of becoming an abuser sends chills up my spine. I'm constantly questioning if whether I'm a narcissist or sociopath, and If my actions are abusive. I just know that abusers are more likely to have a past where they've been abused, and I don't want my abuse to manifest like that. I just hope that I don't turn out like my abuser and break someone else's psyche."
CPTSD,Positive self-talk never resonated with me. And people criticizing me for not using it has left a lot of scars.,"I always felt yucky using positive self-talk, but the criticism from my own family and the professional emotional abuser from my mid-late teens (>!who was doing conversion therapy for autistic people to me!<) still rings in my goddamn head to this day. I also don't appreciate people telling me that I ""should be grateful"" when I'm upset about something. Save your perspective-giving for AFTER I'm done feeling my feelings.

And those intrusive thoughts of my voice saying in a sweet tone ""it's ok,"" whenever someone is being unempathetic or straight up criticizes me is fucking stifling! They have been haunting me every single day for the past almost year!

I also resent the advice of never seeking external validation ever because of this very thing above! External validation from the right tribe both online and IRL is what I need most. How can I ever love myself the way I am if I don't find a tribe that serves as a role model? I found an amazing tribe online, but my IRL isolation despite living with my immediate family is really catching up to me. That's why I am in social survival mode right now in the online landscape where if you say the wrong thing, you get cancelled and rendered a pariah. It's warping my view of friendships and relationships and I fucking hate it."

CPTSD,What's this mean??,"Hello.  I woke up this morning after having a dream like this for the first time.  There was a childhood friend of my sister's who was speaking harshly to me.  I was cleaning a neighbor's home.  I dropped what I was doing, right then, and went over to her got in her face and told her wha I thought about her.  I was puffed up, ready to brawl.  It never got that far.
I've never been or felt that assertive.
I did a lot of memory work yesterday and let out a lot that I kept inside.  Could that be the reason??  Freeing up space?!"
CPTSD,I just discovered that I have been scapegoated by my former friends group. Turned out it was not healthy for me after all. Glad I left them. I am ok though.

I deleted more then 13 people in my network last year. Its really quiet right now. But at least there is no more toxicity.
Is this part of growth?
Pretty lonely if you ask me."
CPTSD,Does anyone else suffer from desire,"to make a difference in this world, or at least in oneâ€™s immediate surroundings, yet is unable due to maladaptive invisibility, social awkwardness, lack of credentials (because my brains were too frazzled to graduate from college), constant seeking of security and CPTSD isolation? Yearning for connection and recognition, yet failing miserably? 
Iâ€™ve ended up in a â€œcareerâ€ far, far below my potential, yet I keep torturing myself with dreams of â€œone dayâ€ starting projects that will help others, which will make significant positive impact on their lives, and I will be acknowledged as a deserving member of mankind. While in the meantime, Iâ€™m being dismissed and scoffed at as a fool. Is this yearning and torturing oneself just a subliminal cry for parents love and approval? 
How does one discern what oneâ€™s objective possibilities are, or at least become aware of extent of damage and accept present life as the only one, one can have?
I realize this is a depressing thought, but Iâ€™ve been revving my inner engine without any benefit to anyone, least of all myself, to a point that for the first time in my life Iâ€™m  afraid Iâ€™m really going to lose my mind.
Any constructive input will be most welcome."
CPTSD,Whatâ€™s even the point,"I just donâ€™t get anything anymore. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m in constant chronic pain. Iâ€™ve had 3 invasive and rough surgeries within 2 years and on the last one, my ovary had to be cut into and cleaned/scrapped out from stage 4 endo. My hormones have been completely fucked with because of the surgeries and medications and other shit the Drs have put me on. Iâ€™m a shell of the original shell of myself now. I canâ€™t think clearly half the time, I canâ€™t remember shit anymore (I used to be able to memorize chapters of stuff at a time), and I just donâ€™t have the energy for shit anymore. 


I get told periodically that the shit I say is stupid and that was said again to me this morning. Itâ€™s a trigger. I was told in the system all the time how stupid I was and I was constantly torn down. My car is broken down at the moment so I have to be taken to work. The individual that needs to take me was extremely tired and really needed sleep so I mentioned to them that I could just call off for a couple hours and then they could drop me off right before they went to work. I got snapped at and thatâ€™s when I was told the things I say are stupid. Guys, I canâ€™t take life anymore. Iâ€™m so tired and so sick of everything. Finding the will to keep going is so hard.


Iâ€™m tired of the chronic pain, Iâ€™m tired of not having energy for anything, Iâ€™m tired of being torn down and triggered like this. My entire life has been a shit show. I was severely abused, neglected, starved and just recently found out that I was actually tortured too for 11 years. I didnâ€™t know that one of the positions they made me work in as a kid was called a stress position. I was made to work outside and pulling weeds in a stress position. We lived out in the countryside so that how they were able to get away with that. It destroyed my knees and my back and I just turned 30. Iâ€™m just so over it and I donâ€™t know how to get out of this pit of despair and depression Iâ€™m in. I just donâ€™t want to keep going anymore. 


Iâ€™m too chicken to try to end myself again and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll fail at it again and then be put in a worse position. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I just want to completely shut down and stop functioning. Again, Iâ€™m just so tired and worn out. Nothing really brings me joy anymore either. I have nothing in my life outside of my cat to keep going for. I finally reached the point where I donâ€™t care too much to even keep going for my husband. Iâ€™m shattered and broke and thereâ€™s no putting me back together. Itâ€™s impossible now. I just donâ€™t know anymore."
CPTSD,Fighting my issues vs accepting them. Id rather die,"I cannot stand that i am supposed to suffer like this. I shouldn't have to suffer like this. Every therapist tells me i should accept my shortcomings and struggles. But thats impossible, i hate all of them, i hate myself for being so broke  and held back. I hate this world, i hate this life, and eith each day im closer and closer to throwing it all away. I dream about betrer worlds, and a completely better me. I wish i could just stay in my room, give up work, cut off connections from people, and engorge myself in entertainment and dissociate freely until I die. This world isn't worth setting goals and working hard for something. This world is absolute dogshit, and so is this life and ugly body ive been given."
CPTSD,"Alright, I need your help :)","How on earth do you manage to be anything other than deeply hurt, emotionally numb, sad and burdened by the pressures of life when you have ABSOLUTELY NO support system in your life?

It just makes me feel so vulnerable. There is no one coming to rescue me. I have no one to turn to. The really funny thing is that while I have done my best to overcome these feelings by trying to build a new support system around me, it has always come crashing down on me.

I have no one to rely on and that scares me. I feel like there is a huge weight on my chest and I can't do anything about it.

I've tried all kinds of distractions. They work, but at the same time they don't. The feeling of being alone doesn't make me lonely. It scares me. I like being alone, but I need a support system to function like a normal person, and I don't have one.

Why do I need a support system so much? It makes no sense, and yet it does? I guess I just feel left alone in a desert. Being left alone sucks. I want to be alone by choice, not by lifeâ€™s odd circumstances. I want to have support in life because it really does make EVERYTHING so much better. No creepy thoughts at night, no shadows creeping on you, no overthinking, no dead weight on your chestâ€¦ Just peace and assurance."

CPTSD,Do you feel guilt when good things happen?,"Just reflecting on a few things this morning, and realizing I often feel guilty if something good happens to me.  Like itâ€™s an undeserved fluke and Iâ€™m taking something good away from someone who actually deserves it.  Anyone else feel this way?

I remember giving up a part I was offered in a High School play despite really wanting it, because I felt so undeserving and guilty about taking it from someone else. 

And more recentlyâ€¦my sister in law and I had babies within a few days of each other in 2022.  Her son, my nephew, passed away a few months later, and Iâ€™ve had some pretty intense emotional responses ever since. Itâ€™s gotten better with time, but I felt so very guilty even just holding my son after that. ðŸ˜” I didnâ€™t feel I deserved to be the one with a healthy child. At the same time, it also made me more aware that sometimes bad things arenâ€™t â€œdeservedâ€, which was a pretty core belief of mine from my childhood. 

Anyway, just wondering if this is a common CPTSD thing, or more just a â€œmeâ€ thing.

Edited to correct some typos and still didnâ€™t catch them all, Iâ€™m sure "
CPTSD,feeling betrayed by someone I had very precious memories from,"My cousin used to hang out with me a lot. 
Memories with her are mostly positive. She, just like me, is on the autism spectrum and she always seemed very straightforward, sometimes even cold and blunt. So that was always there.

But I remember her wanting to meet up and enjoying time spend with me and my sister.

We kind of lost contact throughout the years. We're now mid 20s. 
Her father was always on my side when it came to my horrible father. 

I noticed one day she's not following me on instagram anymore. 
Then I messaged her that I remembered very nice things and I'd like to meet up and chat. She was very curious about the 'trauma tea', as always I think.

We met up, I talked about things, to me it seemed obviously a little awkward but not 'no contact' awkward. 

Ever since that meeting we went back to little contact, she's not messaging, I'm the one messaging things. Now I asked her about something again, after she quickly responded to something, and her not replying is the answer to what I was afraid of. 

She doesn't want me in her life. For some reason. For no reason? Just like my brother doesn't want me in his life. 

I feel so used by her. I feel like she wanted all the spicy trauma drama tea and is basically ghosting me now.

It's so hard to accept this, after I reached out to her because once dissociated memories appeared and I felt like not everything in my childhood was awful.

Don't know how to cope now. I wish she would just directly message me that she doesn't see us that close together or whatever. 

It's also weird because her father cares about me so much. I'd love to talk to him about her but that's not his business. Just makes it awkward for me to reach out to him, knowing she for some reason doesn't want anything to do with me. 

Why?"

CPTSD,Private diagnosis,"Hi all, hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Iâ€™ve just had an appointment yesterday in the nhs with a consultant psychiatrist who agreed a treatment plan with me. I know I can get a diagnosis through the NHS but itâ€™s a minimum 3 month wait. Iâ€™ve had this condition since I was 8 years old and Iâ€™ve spent most of my adult life trying to figure out wtf is wrong with me.  Iâ€™m now 29 and I donâ€™t want to wait any longer so looking at going private for a diagnosis and then continuing my treatment through the nhs. Has anyone done this before? and has any recommendations for private psychiatric assessments in the uk that are reasonably priced?"
CPTSD,Medical history concealment,"So I have a medical condition I was born with but wasnâ€™t diagnosed with until I was nearly 3 years old. Iâ€™ve always asked questions about my diagnosis and what went down during that time. Iâ€™ve always received vague answers but recently I requested my medical records from that hospital. 

What I found was, I had procedures carried out on me during this time that I was never told about. For reasons Iâ€™m unsure of. I asked many times over the years if I had any operations etc to always be told no, I hadnâ€™t. I also saw a lot of negligence in the sense I had many missed appointments over the years following my diagnosis. My caregivers were also unmotivated in understanding my condition and pursuing psychological and social care for themselves and the family. There was also negligence surrounding my hygiene during this time.

In the years following I developed a needle phobia and in one of the letters to a psychology referral, it was noted that my fears stemmed from believing I would not wake up, that when I would faint I could still hear voices but not move. It was also noted that I was hyper vigilant and my mother was quoted saying that â€œI would feel more comfortable not speaking with a man.â€ 

I grew up in a DV home and I have had exposure to unsafe situations and flashbacks of sexual abuse that I cannot seem to confirm if they really happened. I basically glanced over my whole medical file and will read it in more detail this evening to try and make sense of everything. Why do I feel like there is more to my story than what I think?

Should I seek out the reports from the time I saw the child psychologist? Should I enquire with social services if there ever was a file opened up about myself and my family?

One thing I know for sure, is that my caregivers were negligent in how they handled my diagnosis. I understand that it must have been terrifying and uncomfortable for them, but on the other hand I donâ€™t understand why they wouldnâ€™t remain consistent with my care during that very vulnerable time. I also donâ€™t understand why I was lied to about undergoing any procedures.

I donâ€™t even know where Iâ€™m going with this journey to be honest. I guess because I donâ€™t have much memory of my younger years and have always received vague and patchy answers from my parents, I want to know my own story."
CPTSD,Is it odd that a neurologist isnâ€™t familiar with cptsd?,I had an appointment with a neuro recently and explained I have cptsd. He asked me what it was.
CPTSD,what i experienced was not normal.,"what i experienced at the hands of my abusive mother and passive, enabling father was not normal.

it was not normal for my own mother to call me dumb and an idiot any time she didn't get her way.

it was not normal for my own mother to threaten me with violence for having any opinion contrary to hers.

it was not normal for my own mother to forcefully isolate my in my room because she didn't want me spending time with kids from school, and instill fear in me about becoming friends with anyone outside of our ethnic group.

and it was not normal for my own father to not stop her, and instead stand right there and allow her to destroy our sense of self-esteem and self worth while he watched, only to say ""you know how your mom is"" after the fact.

IT WAS NOT NORMAL

NONE OF THIS SHIT WAS NORMAL

I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM THAT SHITTY ASS HOUSE.

CPTSD,Should I visit the school that traumatized me for the healing process?,"Last night, I felt a strong need to go back and confront my old teachers and tell them how painful it was and their neglect and ignorance badly affected me. I don't know why. Maybe to finally be heard and not seen as a fake. Is this a bad idea?"
CPTSD,How do you accept that there was trauma when you donâ€™t remember it?,"I struggle to have any compassion for myself because I just donâ€™t feel like I have any justification to do so. When I try to look at the past to reference how it affects the way I am now, thereâ€™s just nothing. 

I can describe what happened in words vaguely, â€œthis happened and this happened and this happenedâ€. But I recount it the way you recount fables you read as a kid, you just kind of recount it with no meaning to it, just a bunch of arbitrary things that sort of happen. 

I always believe Iâ€™m not trying hard enough but Iâ€™m pretty sure I need to loosen my grip. Itâ€™s hard to though when I canâ€™t believe that I would ever need that. I canâ€™t help but look at the opportunities I lose day by day and only feel more compelled to get over this. But doing so always makes me worse

I know the point is to just accept trauma as it is and deciding on whether itâ€™s truly valid or not is pointless if it had affected you so strongly. But I just truly donâ€™t see a reason or a need to heal when I can barely believe that itâ€™s trauma at all and not just a bunch of bad stuff that happened. I keep feeling like when I accept bad things happened to me, Iâ€™m looking at things through an unappreciative and pessimistic lens. I feel stupid for being the way I am now because in the moment when it was all happening, I was â€œfineâ€. I was â€œhappyâ€ then. Itâ€™s like, â€œwhy do I feel like such shit nowâ€?

Obviously things happened, but I just canâ€™t accept it when I donâ€™t really have anything to justify it. If I donâ€™t have a justification I feel deluded."
CPTSD,"I donâ€™t know anymore, I just donâ€™t","I feel kind of lost because of how hyper vigilance and fawning destroys any real perception I have of the world. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s right or wrong for me anymore and my senses are gone, and I know I have to figure that out for myself because putting myself â€œin lineâ€ to what other people think is right just keeps me dependent. 

Fawning absolutely destroys any sense of self in me, I start to want things that I donâ€™t truly want at all because I think I should. Because I think I am meant to become nothing and serve another person to have a meaningful existence. Itâ€™s actually ridiculous, I rejected someone romantically once and to be honest I hated them. But I brooded over it for a week because I felt that responsible. But the part that is â€œmeâ€ is just unacceptable in my eyes, so I canâ€™t help but mask it up with my fawning self. 

Hypervigilance makes everything worse, itâ€™s one thing to be fragmented and confused. In addiction to that I can barely distinguish truly safe environments from whatever my brain is chronically afraid of. Iâ€™m just always afraid, whether Iâ€™m with a friend Iâ€™ve known for years or Iâ€™m with someone new, who has no expectations of me and there is no â€œlineâ€ to act in accordance to. Unless Iâ€™m completely isolated, my body feels unsafe. 

I thought of it in my head like, â€œI am a sock puppet of a human beingâ€. Iâ€™m so confused and frantic Iâ€™ll just turn to the exterior to react to, because you canâ€™t go â€œwrongâ€ if you do what is â€œgoodâ€. But a lot of the time doing that makes me miserable and feel bad. But if I do what I truly want I may be acting selfishly and carelessly which makes me feel worse. 

I feel embarrassed and ashamed to be alive and the only thing that alleviates that is to do whatever other people want and say is best. Even when it makes me feel like shit. Iâ€™m too confused, everything makes me feel bad, everything makes me feel good, I donâ€™t know anymore."
CPTSD,"Suddenly realized my childhood trauma as a parent, at 44.","Hello. Sorry if this is long. Haven't found any help, and I'm experiencing a breakdown, triggered from a recent event apparantly.
I'm a 44 yo husband/father of a 6yo daughter and 9yo son.  Successful in my life but I have always had major anxiety.

In short, my mother watches my kids and nephew a few times a week after school, if I have work (from home). Today I was told that my mother's neighbor's boy, who's friends with my children and nephew, had my 6 yo nephew strip his clothes off while they were alone playing. Both 6 yo.

My children were not there. THANKFULLY.   Basically, when I imagine that happening to my daughter, I have a full blown uncontrollable crying panic attack. I almost lose control of my body, voice and have to sit down. I go from being a strong man and dad to something pretty pathetic in about 1 second.  As I type this I'm having one.m it a nightmare.  This is brand new as of 1-4-2024.

 This event with my nephew triggered something inside me that's awful. I'm realizing I have trauma from being abused by a drunk aggressive uncle, when I was around 9. I don't think he ever physically sexually did anything,  but he  would man handle me or be rough with me.  He would scare me till I pissed myself. Don't know how many times this happened.
 I told my parents but nothing was done, and I'm sure his scary demeanor didn't help. He scared me to death with his dog during my childhood too. It seems I have much more trauma from these events than I thought. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm holding a wound shut that just pours blood if I let go. And I don't want to let my kids out of my house. Causing major rift between my wife but she saw me fall apart last night and was shocked. Fml"
CPTSD,Is kicking your kid out of the house abuse?,"My mother has done this in the past and would not hesitate to do it again. Basically, if we are having a fight, she will scream or sometimes physically push me outside, and I will not be allowed back in the house for a couple of hours for any reason, the longest she ever did it was around 7 hours I think? It doesn't matter the weather conditions, and I'm not allowed to go to the bathroom, or get water or food. Is this abuse?"
CPTSD,Please tell me it gets better.,"I am new to this community but I'm not new with feeling the way I do. I can't remember anything before I was 7 years old and I've been dissacoiating my entire life. I've had bereavements and trauma and alot of sexual assault, and I'm finding life more and more difficult every single day. I feel I've done quite a good job fooling everyone around me that I am doing well but inside I feel quite broken and unwell. Can anyone here tell me it gets better. Please..."
CPTSD,Cant stop making mistakes everywhere,"Everyday, manager comes and points out so many mistakes ive made angrily. They are really important mistakes too, which requires a talk if necessaey. It becomes so demoralozing, cause some of these are repeated mistakes that they keep trying to cover me for so i don't get written up. 
God i feel so incompetant. I make mistakes everywhere i go, even ourside of work, to the point where i avidly convince people im mistake prone and always make mistakes no matter what i do to prevent it. This makes people not like me, this makes my family members who dont want me to get fired mad, and it makes me feel like shit that i can never seem to get a break. Ill never heal, im going to be completely hurt over and over... they game mad when i do the same mistakes... but i cant fucking help it..."

CPTSD,"[Trigger warning: Gross stuff, occult abuse] Anyone else's abuser do really bizarre things or have extremely delusional ideas about why they were abusing you?","My dad forced my mom to conceive me because he believed he would have a powerful witch/lover as a daughter who he needed to bring into the world. When I was born they called me ""witch baby"" and ascribed me with all sorts of uncanny characteristics, like I was a character in some kind of f%$#ed up fairy tale. My dad struggled with drug/alcohol abuse and psychosis (he was at one point diagnosed schizo-effective bi-polar) but my mom was ""normal"" aside from insecure narcissistic traits and being badly abused by him. She was basically disassociated all the time and just left me with him to go start a career when I was a few months old.

My abuse included so many horrible things starting so young it's impossible to cover it all but there was drugging with many different substances, molestation, rape, being forced to consume my own waste, and a number of times I almost died from suffocation, strangulation and the effects of the drugs.

He also attempted to develop me as a psychic which was a tradition in his family (which is a whole nother story) but he went beyond teaching me the tarot and about divination. He believed that certain kinds of r*pe would make me a more powerful psychic. 

This is just scratching the surface but I wanted to see if I'm the only one here with these kind of experiences."
CPTSD,I am in hospital because of stress and i don't know how to heal,"Hello everyone. It turns out stress can actually kill you. Some people can't sleep, other got stomach issues or headaches.. I have two stomach ulcers and i'm faiting all the time. They scanned my head but everything seems fine. They tested my heart and it's healthy. Eevery single doctor tells me that the problem is in my brain and that only i can help myself if i don't want to take antidepressants. 
I'm in a hole. My 11 year relationship is falling apart because of my communication problems. I'm running away from every problem and expect fot it to fix itself. I don't know if i am a narcissist or egocentric or i just lack empathy for others. I even prefer to stay at the hospital than to go home and communicate our problems. Me and my partner are trauma bonded. I hate if someone controlls me and he wants constant validation and prove that he is loved. Every argument ends badly. It got to the point where he screams uncontrollably and punches stuff. Everytime he tells me what he need but everytime our conversations end up with me crying and him being dissapointed and angry. He told me that if he could turn back time he would never date me.. He wants to controll my relationship with my family because he doesn't like them and think they disrespect him so recently he started taking my phone and looking through all my conversations and judging the way i speak to them. He even wrote to my mother as if it was me. He got so used to it that he started looking for my phone when i'm asleep. Usually i put it under my pillow because i don't have a shelf so he literally puts his hand under my head while i am sleeping to take my phone even tho that wakes me up and stresses me out. 
Please share with me how do you deal with stress and how do you deal with communication problems? I'm even afraid to start talking and if he gets angry at me or start yelling i start shaking and i'm fainting.."
CPTSD,cptsd makes boundary setting hard,"i (23f) need help setting a boundary with my (21m) friend

some of you might find this silly but iâ€™m a very traumatized person who struggles with setting boundariesâ€”although iâ€™m trying to change this.

so thereâ€™s a guy i met online a long time ago. we started off sexting and planning to meet for a hookup, but i was traveling a lot and not in town and it just never came to fruition.

we talk everyday for over a year and have built a really lovely and supportive friendship. iâ€™m dating other people and iâ€™m 99% sure he is too. he has expressed no desire to enter into a romantic relationship with me. i havenâ€™t either but i think itâ€™s very very clear that iâ€™m open to it. i just reserve plainly stating so because i donâ€™t chase i attract 

so sometimes he still initiates sexting, and itâ€™s fun and thrilling i think heâ€™s so hot. but i also have started to feel knots in my stomach about it. i donâ€™t think i want to sext him anymore because i want to reserve that for the people iâ€™m dating, especially for someone who wants to commit to me. i lovee our friendship heâ€™s so sweet to me but i feel hurt that he expresses sexual interest but not romantic interest. 

i donâ€™t wanna be a castrating buzzkill when i tell him, bc given how our friendship started, itâ€™s not unreasonable for him to assume i have no issues with it bc i havenâ€™t communicated this to him. i would feel okay with sexting if i knew he had romantic feelings for me but i also donâ€™t want him to feel pressured to date me. seeking input on how to approach this. feeling so overwhelmed. i am specifically asking: how should i word this? and when should i say this? when he tries to initiate sexting or in another moment?

tldr; need help with how to set a boundary with my guy friend. i donâ€™t want to sext anymore because i have romantic feelings for him and i do not think he feels the same way"
CPTSD,I donâ€™t know if my COCSA is COCSA or something else,"iâ€™m gonna make it short

as a child there were three of us and we would engage in sexual acts, not real sex but pretty much everything but, i remember we would do things and then say that we couldnâ€™t talk about it all to anyone. we knew it was wrong. 

hereâ€™s where my questions come in 

1. i definitely have been traumatized from this, but all of us consented, so what do i even call that kind of trauma?

2. i know it was â€œexperimentalâ€ and â€œnormalâ€ but it feels like (for me) it was beyond the normal range in terms of what exactly was going on. that would be making out, grinding, everything but penetration, so where does that fall?

3. iâ€™m pretty sure at least two of us had previous sexual encounters/assaults(myself included). does that have anything to do with it? 

4. over time (this lasted for years) me and one of the other children would be pressured into it, at first it was just the one child saying no but then the older child would convince him to say yes, i would just sit there, then eventually it turned to me saying no and then begging me until i said yesâ€¦ where on the spectrum does that fall because we all consented but also we didnâ€™t 

Again, it was all what I feel like would be considered experimental, and technically it was all consensual, but i have sexual trauma for sure, from this and other things, and i donâ€™t wanna invalidate anyone but i also donâ€™t know what else to think"
CPTSD,Freezing while in Freeze?,"When I'm overwhelmed, I sometimes shut down in a very specific way where I would feel exhausted and then freezing cold. Like chilled to the bone cold. This seems to have no correlation to the actual temperature of the environment I'm in. 

When it happens I can't do anything but curl up in my bed and wait until I fall asleep, which will always happen eventually. When I wake up I'm usually overheated because I've turned the heating up when I was experiencing this weird cold.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?"
CPTSD,Narcissist husband stole ALL MY ID's,"I went through the little bit of belonging I have left.. Nothing
He stole EVERYTHING I 
No Driver's License
No Social security card
No medical Marijuana catds
No AAA card.
My $1300 HP laptop

He literally TOOK
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING
.
I can't even get a job..
I lost my disability benefits taking care of him... 

My husband 
He took everything
I have no way to help myself..."
CPTSD,I wish I could go numb again,"I wanna dissociate and wake up when I graduate and move out. How the fuck am I supposed to last 3 more years??? And what if Iâ€™m so depressed I fuck something up again? Then itâ€™ll be even longer or maybe Iâ€™ll never graduate, who knows.

And every time Iâ€™m depressed or suicidal I get judged, which certainly doesnâ€™t help lol. My mom laughs at me, thinks Iâ€™m faking it, or blames me. Sometimes she says itâ€™s bc Iâ€™m not religious enough and I donâ€™t rely on Jesus (spoiler alert: Iâ€™m not religious at all).

Anyway, I just donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t wanna be conscious but if Iâ€™m not Iâ€™ll probably fuck up further. What do I do? How do I survive this?"
CPTSD,Did I experience CSA or just emotional neglect?,"I was sexually assaulted on a date a few nights ago and I canâ€™t stop feeling like this hasnâ€™t been the first time. I donâ€™t have any memories of SA as a child, only emotional neglect (my family is very religious). I got an ad for repressed childhood sexual trauma and Iâ€™ve gone down a bit of a rabbit hole. 

Some symptoms I have
- Frequent dissociation during childhood (I remember it happening more specifically around going to church and church events)
- Very few childhood memories and pretty horrible memory in general
- My first sexual fantasy in middle school was about bondage and being taken advantage (Iâ€™ve had rape fantasies since then)
- I have a lot of trouble orgasming and only want kinky sex (I feel so much shame around sex and feel completely empty and lonely after)
- I frequently age regress (also growing up, I sucked my thumb until I was 13)
- Multiple abusive relationships, feeling a need to please men (specifically older men)
- Digestive issues, mood swings, trust issues, impulsivity, etc. 

Iâ€™ve always had this sinking feeling that something bad happened to me but I have absolutely no memory of any abuse. Has anyone else felt this way and discovered it was csa? Is there any way to find out for sure if itâ€™s just emotional neglect or if I actually experienced csa?"
CPTSD,Zopiclone,"My Dr prescribed me Zopiclone because of CPTSD-related sleep issues - canâ€™t get to sleep, canâ€™t stay asleep etc etc

It is good in GETTING you to sleep, and youâ€™ll stay asleep for exactly 6-7 hours, to the minute you went to sleep, but I had really vivid and scary dreams the first time I took it, and felt very lucid as I started to fall asleep and into a dream.

I didnâ€™t take them last night and slept from 21:00 til 02:00, so theyâ€™re definitely a help. I did feel as if I stayed really drowsy all day though."
CPTSD,Get so stressed or overwhelmed that my body shuts down,"DAE experience this? 
I get so tired and feel like sleeping/hibernating when things get super hard. Even if I have ""energy"" if I suddenly feel stressed or overwhelmed by things (triggers or life events or just finding it hard to cope), I suddenly feel exhausted and soooo tired. I don't know what to do when this happens. I struggle to be productive if I try to push through it. Or I sleep then feel bad if I don't get anything done. But it's so hard. It makes me feel so worthless at times. Like I'm so lazy or something. I dunno. Just the exhaustion of surviving stuff or dealing with stress and I seem to crash and burn. 

I always try to tell myself there will be a break soon from everything but I never get it."
CPTSD,I feel like my therapist has given up on me,"I have been seeing this therapist for almost 2 years. I started with DBT therapy and then she said she wanted to try EMDR which wasnâ€™t working for me. I work at a youth shelter where I have experienced trauma both with the youth I work with and with poor management. She shared with me a few months ago that she didnâ€™t feel comfortable doing EMDR while I was still working in the same place. I was originally looking for a new job but Iâ€™ve decided to stay where Iâ€™m at because, â€œthe devil you know is better than the devil you donâ€™t.â€ I understand not wanting to do EMDR work on the things that have happened to me at work, but sheâ€™s not willing to work on my past either, which is also still very queuing for me. I feel like since we stopped EMDR, there is no point to the therapy sessions. She shared with me this week that we could go down to fewer sessions and mentioned again that while Iâ€™m still working in the same place, that sheâ€™s not comfortable doing EMDR, but that I could find a different clinician that may be comfortable with it. I do feel like I have improved a lot over the past couple years, but that there are still things that are still deeply affecting my everyday life. I really valued her as a therapist and Iâ€™m thankful for the help she did provide, but this hit me like a ton of bricks. I feel helpless and like Iâ€™m going to suffer with the symptoms Iâ€™m still experiencing for the rest of my life. Like Iâ€™m too broken for therapy. 

I guess Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if anyone has any advice."
CPTSD,"Took a dance class. â€œRelax,â€ she says. â€œBreath,â€ she says.","As part of my healing journey, I signed up for a belly dancing class. I have already been consistently lifting weights for a year and I plan on starting jujitsu in a couple of months. The studio that does the belly dancing also has yoga, so I will throw a couple of those in for some fun, but yoga frustrates me still. 

That said, I had the dance class to myself tonight, so a private lesson. I am an ok dancer, I can keep rhythm, and as Shakira said, â€œMy hips donâ€™t lie!â€ Tonight she had me do very basics and slow down all of the movements. I can do a few things at tempo, but slowing it down I have to think about it. If I think about it, I start to tense up and apparently I stop breathing (same issue I have in yoga, btw). So class tonight was a lot of, â€œYou can release the tension.â€ â€œRelax,â€ and â€œbreathe!â€ 

I enjoyed the class! I love to dance, but I walked out with my inner critic digging in and criticizing me for not being able to â€œgetâ€ very basic movements. Doesnâ€™t matter that the teacher admitted that it took her months to be able to do exactly what I was trying, I should have â€œjust been able to get it.â€ Luckily I am far enough in my progress to see that for the bull shit it is, but there it is all the same. 

On the drive home it finally clicked: My perfectionism tendencies donâ€™t just include â€œdo it right or donâ€™t start it at all.â€ I had some experiences as a kid where if I didnâ€™t do it right, I didnâ€™t get to do it again. I had a small little part of me that was terrified that if I didnâ€™t get those basic moves down perfect tonight, that I wouldnâ€™t be allowed to come back, so might as well quit before it was taken from me. Iâ€™m exhausted from the amount of braining to puzzle that one out, but little part has been soothed and put to bed.

â€œRelax,â€ she said. â€œBreath,â€ she said. â€œSee you next week?â€ she asked. I think she shall."
CPTSD,Which of these is SA? (TW)Graphic,"I've been in therapy for a long time, but I feel like I am in denial. And I keep ruminating.  
  
\#1: I was 10 and my cousin was 11. My cousin fingered me and I kept telling them not to do that. We did a bunch of other unfortunate and weird things  
  
\#2: A came onto a guy when I was wasted at 14. He may have penetrated me I dont remember  
  
\#3: I was 15 and a guy (17) pretended to want to go out a date with me. He kept making me give him head in his car and groping me and I was begging to leave. He ghosted me after. He later confessed/apologized to me but the police told me it wasn't serious  
  
\#4: I made out with a 21 yr old guy when I was 14/15  
  
\#5: FWB would randomly take the condom off in the dark without notice. Or he would put it in my ass when i was too high to really respond, but eventually took it out when i told him to.  
  
\-#6. Dude I was hooking up with regularly called me stupid. He held my legs down and made me have sex without a condom. Then he cuddled with me after. He told me he r@ped me and smiled. the next few days he was really paranoid i would go to the police. he got more sexually vanilla and i got mad at him about this and insulted his manhood. I was a mess idk.  
  
\#7- Dude took off condom intentionally and finished in me without warning, then stalked me for a bit because we 'connected' so much.  
  
\#8 i went to guy's house and he was much uglier in person. I told him previously about bad sexual experiences in a vague way. He's insistent about making out with me immediately and making me get on my knees to blow him. He returns the favor and it wasn't unenjoyable but he grossed me out in general. Guy becomes obsessed with me and also wouldnt leave me alone. i dont think about this a lot but i think its gross  
  
\#9 im rly high and dont know who i am. I'm pretty sure he laced the weed with a lot of ketamine. I had unprotected creampie sex with a guy while im at least partially passed out. But he did check in with me a lot. we begin dating. He gets obsessive and jealous. He would threaten to hit/rape me if she didn't have sex with him (in a calm voice). He'd also tell me how worthless i was when we cuddled together. But sometimes he'd also be caring and understanding if i didnt want sex. He got very mad at me (we both cheated on each other) and inflicted pain leading to me crying and getting a migraine, then left and cut off contact with me. Though ,he did try to reconnect many times. in the months after this I thought everything I said was so stupid and wrong I barely spoke  
  
\#10 Guy puts in it when i kept telling him not to without a condom. i got chlamydia.  
  
\#11 Idk a guy just started choking me after I went home with him and I went along with it. I guess it was fine. I told him I had to pee and he didn't let me so I peed on him, which annoyed him, but what was I supposed to do? tf lol  
  
\#12 I met up with a guy. I was really high and sleep deprived. He asked me for sex 40+ times, probably so he could tell himself he didn't rape me. I eventually let him and was barely conscious  
  
\#13- I didn't really count this one, but maybe I should have. He was my coke plug. He kept trying to make me finish and it hurt so I kept telling him to stop, and he wouldn't. I had to come up with a few obscure lies to make him stop  
  
\#14- I told him I didn't want to have sex with him anymore. He begged me to just 'sit still' and 'let it happen' but I hit him in the throat"
CPTSD,"trying to get out of an abusive home, but iâ€™m so worried for my future","iâ€™m f21 from california and work in a small vitamin/wellness store. iâ€™ve been here for a year and have learned a lot of supplements, but iâ€™m also a cashier, i price items, i can use excel and a pos system, i can put brand new items into our computer system so they ring up, the whole shebang

however, my boyfriend and i want to move to texas at some point. he doesnâ€™t like the state weâ€™re from, and im trying to get out of an abusive household

texas apparently has the vitamin shoppe, but ive applied there once (in california) and they didnâ€™t respond lmao. iâ€™m not saying the texas one will be the same, it might, but it looks like they ONLY have the vitamin shoppe

iâ€™ve wanted to quit for a while just because where i work now, itâ€™s a very toxic environment. iâ€™ve been physically grabbed by creepy customers 4 times now and itâ€™s very triggering, but they still wonâ€™t do anything for our safety. my other girl coworker told me she had a man put his hands around her throat, in front of our manager, and he didnâ€™t do anything or intervene. 

i wanted to apply to this car parts/automotive shop because they were looking for a cashier, and it seems to be more interesting, but i was wondering â€œoh, will i be able to work in a shop like this in texas? or would i have to be a full mechanic or something?â€ which i wanted to go to school for anyway, but thatâ€™s gonna take a bit

clearly, ill stay in a place if im â€œcomfortableâ€ but it doesnt always necessarily mean im happy or doing well. i just want to do well so i can get out of here, but thinking about it makes me beyond anxious and all i want to do is stop everything so i dont have to deal with it. 

can you tell i pick freeze and flight?"

CPTSD,How do you make the nightmares stop?,"I used to have nightmares rarely, but theyâ€™ve become much too frequent.

Every night Iâ€™m swallowed by anxiety because I know that thereâ€™s a chance that Iâ€™ll go to sleep and be placed in a world that is more terrifying than the last. A high chance.

Sometimes I wake up so scared that I canâ€™t move. Sometimes I wake up and I canâ€™t tell if what just happened was real or not.

I used to keep a log of them, but theyâ€™ve gotten too bad for me to want to ever have to share with people that havenâ€™t been through it.

What caused the sudden nightmares?? This didnâ€™t use to happen this frequently. Itâ€™s about 70% of the time now, compared to what used to be 5-10%. 

What are some things I can do to avoid nightmares?"
CPTSD,Husband has cptsd and I need so much support,"He is so unreliable. For intimacy, for good feelings, for trips for anything. I find that when I need him most, is when he can't be there for me. I have my own things (not as bad as him) and he triggers and pushes all of them. I too am triggering him. But it's so hard not to. He is so unreliable, he has soo many triggers and his trauma makes him so selfish. In those good moments I know he cares, I just can't rely on him so my mind is saying don't have more kids with him then you will be further on your own especially when you need him most. He's in therapy but doesn't ever breathe a word about his trauma and healing. So I'm meant to trust that he's working through it and just take care of myself when he is unavailable to me. My mother was unavailable to me often it brings back up that pain. I know I'm meant to re parent myself in those moments he is disengaged. But it is so painful. He's helping me heal showing me where I need help but at the same time I can't help but just say what I see. Which shuts him down further. He can't hear critisicm, even my asking him for a hug is too much pressure and expectations. He cannot accept my love, doesn't believe my compliments and often tells me he doesn't feel safe with me (but he doesn't with anybody..) ugh I really find him pathetic and actually:don't like him right now. l think that I'd have greater compassion for him if he told me about his trauma and how hard the work is for him. I hate being ignored, so I just keep reminding him in subtle ways how traumatized he is. Also I really dislike unawareness and he doesn't speak about himself in an aware way or clue me in to his being aware of his dysfunctional behaviors. So  feel like I need to let him know (his wife-the one person he hopes to have safety with). Is it possible to ever show a cptsd husband that you are a safe person if you feel they can't meet your needs? How can I be safe to him when I am presently being hurt? At any moment he may need to disengage (can be triggered by work, therapy, tired, hungry, flashbacks, I remind him of and 'become' his abusive father). How can I create safety, enough for him to heal when I'm actively being hurt by him? Ugh l feel so done!"
CPTSD,Face eczema + parent wanting reassurance,"My entire face flared up and Iâ€™ve been irritable because my body is uncomfortable. More upset now that my mom said â€œIâ€™m so sad that when you were in my stomach I didnâ€™t take care of you better. Then you wouldnâ€™t have thisâ€. Iâ€™m almost 30

I had to be sad and reassure my mom that sheâ€™s not a bad parent."
CPTSD,I was diagnosed this week,"I just turned 30 and while I always knew I was an anxious person, I wasnâ€™t diagnosed with anxiety until my mid-20s. After years of medication, coping skills, therapy and â€œgraduatingâ€ therapy only to return multiple times, along with intense physical symptoms of stress and several periods of horrible depression, I was diagnosed with CPTSD a few days ago.

A basic back story, I work with survivors of human trafficking, most of whom have this diagnosis. So when my therapist told me she believed I have it and would like to treat me for it, I practically laughed in her face. Thereâ€™s no way my childhood compared to that of trafficking victims (to be clear, it still doesnâ€™t-I have so much empathy and respect for these survivors). But she pointed out stories Iâ€™d mentioned-my history of intense pressure to succeed followed by parental emotional neglect. She told me to look at CPTSD from a different lens than I do with my clients. After doing so, I had a complete meltdown. It makes so much sense as to why I am the way I am or why I may have acted the way I have over the past 20 years.

Tonight I found this post from a year ago https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/OnYRWAfVkZ and it describes practically everything Iâ€™ve felt over the years. And the portion noting â€œemotional neglect within outwardly high achieving families can be as damaging as active violence in obviously deprived onesâ€ is something I still donâ€™t think I deserve to hear. My therapist also says I love to minimize my trauma ðŸ˜Œ


Iâ€™m a huge mix of emotions and have had multiple panic attacks this week. Despite the crazy can of worms this opened and the fear of starting work towards real healing, I feel so much relief. I wish I had heard this years ago and been able to start the work then. It likely would have prevented a lot of heartache. But Iâ€™m grateful to have the opportunity to better understand myself, give myself grace, and ACTUALLY heal.

Thank you all for your posts and comments in this sub. I know Iâ€™ll probably be turning to them in the future when Iâ€™m really low. Sending love to you all."
CPTSD,"With fragmentation, is the ANP 'real'?","I've read structural dissociation be described as a self which contains the Apparently Normal Part (ANP), the part which keeps everything going, while the split off Emotional Parts (EPs) hold the trauma and emotions of younger selves.

I am heavily dissociated and do not feel like a real person. But I have been making some progress lately where I can experience the EPs and some form of integration, and when this happens I definitely feel real and have a sense of self. The thing is, I feel like my life paused at like 10. I'm 31.

Maybe it's not a question that can be answered, or only on an individual basis, but I wonder how real the self is that has been in charge these last 21 years. She doesn't feel real, more a collection of fear responses and desperation. She's 'me' essentially - by pure habit I default to her behaviours and opinions. But she's so bereft of any kind of soul or spirit I do wonder what exactly she is. At least that's how it feels.

Any thoughts on this?"
CPTSD,Is there a subreddit for spouses of husbands with cptsd?,"I could really use support
Thank you"
CPTSD,I was sexually abused as a child and Iâ€™m only accepting it now,"Iâ€™m a 31 yr old male, I was sexually abused when I was little at age 6 to 10 ish. I was a very gullible child, easily trusted everyone and was taken advantage of on multiple occasions. I was abused sexually by classmates at school, I was abused by a kid in my building and by a cab driver once while playing alone outside, older kids would make me watch porn saying itâ€™s a movie and force me to watch it. 

Iâ€™m not really sure what the long  implications of these are. I never told anyone this, my friends or my family even when I was a kid. Always held it in. I always thought Iâ€™m strong and I can handle it and never really thought about it until now when Iâ€™m older and I see how it has affected me. 

I donâ€™t have many friends, very few and not the kind who really value me I feel. The more someone knows me, the lesser they respect me. I always pretend to be someone Iâ€™m not to fit in. Iâ€™m impulsive. I used to be a very angry kid, have it mostly under control. Apart from when parents push my buttons which they very well know how to. I am extremely insecure and I always think everything that comes out of my mouth is dumber than a rock, and often times when I somehow muster courage to say something, Iâ€™m so incoherent, Iâ€™m met with blank faces and comments about how stupid I am, and I am extremely hard on myself. It had led to jealousy at times but Iâ€™ve overcome it now.  Iâ€™m scared shitless when it comes to speaking publicly. Iâ€™ve dated a few people but have never been able to keep something stable going. The two longer relationships Iâ€™ve had ended up in them cheating on me, multiple times. Iâ€™m not a bad person. I just feel like Iâ€™m incapable of being loved and feel like maybe I donâ€™t know how to. Iâ€™m anxious and depressed and lonely because Iâ€™m an immigrant staying 8000 miles away from the closest thing to family. I have motivation issues, I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™ve always felt like I canâ€™t remember things, blamed it on lack of effort but maybe thereâ€™s more to it I donâ€™t know. 

Im decently successful at my career, not a bad dude to hang around, but not someone whoâ€™d leave an impression and my parents think Iâ€™m a disappointment because Iâ€™m not married yet and I havenâ€™t bought a house etc. Theyâ€™re very good people, and have always done everything for me but theyâ€™re just too protective and conservative and get pressured from people around them. thatâ€™s forced me to lead a double life. They have no idea what my life is like. 

I think Iâ€™ve finally accepted that Iâ€™m not strong enough to think that the abuse Iâ€™ve faced wonâ€™t affect me. I think it has. I just want to get better and lead whatever normal life it is that I can lead. 
Do I have something to work on? See someone? Fix?"
CPTSD,Diagnosis and Misdiagnoses,"I have been diagnosed and Misdiagnosed many times.  Whenever I did get diagnosed I followed my therapist suggestions and went to groups and such.
One time I was struggling real bad and was mad.  My uncle had assaulted me in my early 30's.
It altered me so much.  Nothing was done about it. VSo I got diagnosed with BPD.  I went to the classes and failed miserably.  I could not understand it.  It was our of my realm.
I didn't have BPD.  
Just sharing."
CPTSD,Am I a bad person for keeping in contact with my indirectly abusive parent?,"Many years ago, my parents finally got a divorce after 17 years of an abusive marriage. Dad never helped in the household (mum gave up her job to become a housewife), frequently shouted during fights, didn't treat her with respect and (most probably) cheated on her for multiple years.

My mum was constantly stressed out and completely overwhelmed with caring for two children (my little brother and me), having little to no support from friends and family. She often resorted to shouting and disregarding us whenever we expressed our own opinions. This and other behavioral traits (such as religious fundamentalism and obsessive over-protectiveness) made me not visit her more than 2-3 times a year since I moved out, even though I basically live around the corner. I never told her how I really feel towards her as she repeatedly contemplated harming herself over comparatively negligible things since I was 15. I also don't think she will ever realize this on her own, as she thinks I have been too busy to visit. She has always been quite naive.

My dad on the other hand never showed abusive behavior towards me. He sure was a scumbag husband, shouting at my mum (sometimes even in front of us children). But apart from that, I never felt like he would reject me for what I am and I believe his affection is genuine.

Since the divorce, my mum mostly talks about what a bad person dad was/is and that he will literally go to hell once he dies. I don't believe in the afterlife, but she does. I had a period of \~6 months where I went NC with my dad, mostly influenced by her stories and the realization that him abusing my mum made her mental instability much worse, which in turn intensified her abusive behavior. I suppose that would make it morally worse than just being a passive enabler. But he was also rarely present when mum was being abusive and when he did witness something he did tell her that she was being unreasonable.

So as you can see I am quite torn about my relationship with my parents and I don't know where to go from here. I know my mum is a victim as well, but we just have nothing to talk about other than her hatred towards dad. Meeting my dad on the other hand feels relatively good and we talk about common interests and stuff, but I somehow feel a bit guilty for ""choosing the wrong side"".

So I guess I have two questions I would like to hear some opinions about:

1. Should I tell my mother how her behavior made me despise her?
2. Am I in the right for staying on good terms with my dad, even though I know how his actions were indirectly abusive towards me?"
CPTSD,i make myself lonely to protect myself,"when i was facing a lot of ridicule in school as a child, i found it harder and harder to make friends every year. and not only because most people didnt want to be friends with me (i was the weird kid), but i didnt let people get close to me. and this has unfortunately become my usual. to this day, i dont let people know personal things about me. i dont talk about my interests, i dont text people individually, and i especially dont start conversations. if someone texts me, the conversation quickly dies. the only person i speak to regularly is my boyfriend. ive also lost what few close friends i had somewhat recently due to very large conflicts, or had them hurt me directly in some way. i assume that has only made my situation worse.

whats so ironic is that i am so very aware of how unhealthy this is. i know its awful for me to be so alone, to have such few friends in my adult life. its hard. im so incredibly lonely, but i wont let myself speak to other people, and i wont let people speak to me. i cant open up, no matter how hard i try. i end up drifting away from any person who gets close to me anyway, so theres almost no point anymore.

it just sucks. i miss having friends and having fun. i just cant help but be distant. im protecting myself from potential hurt, and i guess id rather be alone than hurt more."
CPTSD,Struggles I didn't expect,"So I was diagnosed with ptsd at 16 and later informed I actually have cptsd. I would have flashbacks pretty much daily, trouble sleeping and eating, I couldn't concentrate and I was extremely lonely. I worked through it in therapy for years and I still am. However I did reach the point where I was no longer struggling this intensely and flashbacks/being triggered became much less frequent. I'm 21 now and it feels like when I was first developing ptsd. I get triggered by things that I thought I had gotten past for the most part. I also have intense catatonic episodes where I can't move and sometimes cant talk. It's so discouraging to find myself here again. I have everything I wanted as a kid (freedom, a home where I'm not being abused, people who love me, food, water, etc.) and yet I feel like I'll never escape the past. I don't want to be stuck here for the rest of my life. I don't want to exist in the past so intensely it takes over my present and my ability to enjoy life. I don't know what to do :(."
CPTSD,Urgent Advice Needed: Mother's Violent Outbursts Putting Family at Risk,"I'm reaching out for advice and support in a desperate situation. Recently, i visited my parents during the holidays and my mother unleashed a violent attack on my father, putting his life in serious jeopardy.

  (My father is a struggling alcoholic, and my parents have had a toxic relationship since they got married, and because of which I don't live with them anymore they have made my entire childhood traumatizing and they still continue to do so) 

When I intervened to stop her when she was attacking my father violently with a very sharp object, she turned her aggression towards me, causing injury 

I managed to help my father escape, but now I'm left grappling with the aftermath of this horrifying incident. My father is a harmless man, incapable of defending himself, while my mother seems to exhibit dangerous and unpredictable behavior.

I fear for my father's safety and wonder if, had I not been present, she might have succeeded in causing even greater harm. I'm seeking guidance on how to navigate this situation, legally and emotionally. Any advice or similar experiences would be immensely appreciated."
CPTSD,Anyone taken lamictal / lamotrigine for bouts of depression and CPTSD rage?,"My psych has been talking to me about lamictal for a while. Heâ€™s thinking it will prevent major depressive episodes and CPTSD fight response when triggered. He said this will be helpful when going into trauma-focused therapy. 

Iâ€™m depressed often but taken wellbutrin. I also have Prozac but havenâ€™t started it yet. Every week or two I have a major depressive bout where Iâ€™m on the ground unable to move all day, my inner critic is out for blood and sometimes I end up having a panic response thinking people are going to hurt me. 

I also get triggered and become a major asshole sometimes. Itâ€™s scary. Itâ€™s only happened four times, each this year. I swear and say whatever I can to tear people down and push them away from me. I donâ€™t remember these episodes at all. Iâ€™m told later and sometimes some of it is vaguely familiar then but most I have zero recollection of. 

I also have tunnel vision and feel like Iâ€™m going to pass out when Iâ€™m triggered. For me the trigger is always trust, abandonment, loss or someone turning on me. 

I obviously need to do trauma therapy. Iâ€™ve put it off because it might be too intense and Iâ€™m kind of scared of what may come out. Iâ€™ve had a lot of revelations about my past and thereâ€™s some parts I want to reclaim but a few I may need to keep put away. Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll have any control over what comes up. But maybe lamotrigine will help my responses. 

Outside of triggered moments Iâ€™m a very nice person. I absolutely hate I have this other thing that ruins that and hurts people close to me. If taking a pill daily prevents a couple trauma response a year, itâ€™s worth it. I just canâ€™t be someone who hurts people. Thatâ€™s a life I just canâ€™t live."
CPTSD,Dissociated and drained after therapy,"I had a session tonight and the main focus was a traumatic memory from childhood.  The therapist has heard me mention this memory before, but this was the first time I provided details. I have talked about it many times with other people though and felt fine.  I put myself in the memory and answered questions about how I was feeling when I was younger, what I would have told myself etc.  I felt that it went pretty well.  Difficult since it was my very first time doing that, but I felt totally fine.  Maybe 10-15 minutes after the session ended, I started feeling very dissociated.  I have experienced it on some level 24/7 for as long as I can remember, but I'm in the heavier state, which for me is trance-like: blank/autopilot mind, staring off into space, out of body feeling, etc.  I also started to suddenly feel sleepy whereas I wasn't before at all.  I'm making myself stay up because if I go to sleep this early, I'll be up too early.  Has anyone else experienced this though?  Any idea why?"
CPTSD,Eating disorder annoyance,"Why oh why did people feel it appropriate. Yes, youve spotted im thin, well done. No, telling me to eat a burger wont actually help. 
The worst, most infuriating thing is that in my experience theyd never approach someone overweight and tell them to eat less. Becayse rgat is ""rude"".  Why is it not the same??"
CPTSD,Conflicted on so many fronts,"Hi there, everyone. Please advise me if you have had similar experiences and how to cope. I was the eldest son in a family of emotionally immature and highly toxic parents. 

I concede that both my parents had their own unresolved traumas and this is a generational thing in my family. Doctors are not trusted and religion is used and abused to justify toxic behaviours. I was a gifted kid, high achiever at school, despite constant bullying at school and seeing my parents engage in physical violence with each other and with myself. I was badly beaten by both my parents on the slightest excuse and verbally mocked. 

I developed a stutter around 5 years old and worked hard to overcome it till my early teen years. I learned everything in life by trial and error. I wanted to be a cycle breaker and was even proud to be the black sheep as a teenager. I revolted and grew completely independent, abandoned my studies slightly. Abandoned everything and anything that connected me with my parents. I got back to my senses and tried to rebuild my career in my 20s. I suffered tremendously due to social problems. I tried therapy but it was completely unhelpful.

Now in my early 30s, I feel like a complete failure and feel as if my parentsâ€™ predictions of me being a lifelong failure have come true. I am exhausted and beaten by life. I hate my parents for the active part they played but now seeing them old and physically helpless, though still venomous in speech, I am conflicted. I am daily on the verge of ending my life. How do I proceed? Apologies for the long rant."
CPTSD,A letter to my lover [vent],"Iâ€™m sorry. I stopped talking in calls because I donâ€™t wanna worry you anymore. You didnâ€™t notice, and if you did, you made no comments. We sit in silence a lot now, I just listen to you exist when all I wanna do is tell you about the dumb things my friends are doing. But i donâ€™t wanna upset you. Iâ€™ll continue to just sleepily watch you play games like a good girlfriend. Iâ€™ll learn to be less worrisome. Iâ€™m tired of causing you misery just because everyone else has hurt me. Iâ€™m sorry i trust you too much and that iâ€™ll babble on like my life is normal, when I know its bad. Youâ€™ve been surrounded by love your entire life, you know of cruelty only from an outsider perspective, but I know seeing it torment your lover is harder then just knowing its out there. 

Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t take my medicine. I know you like me better when iâ€™m medicated. I donâ€™t though. I feel lost on my medication, but iâ€™ll do it to make you happier with me. I wish youâ€™d praise me more for it, but your not the type to talk much, let alone tell someone something like that. 

I wanna tell you what goes on in my brain, but I canâ€™t tell you. I cannot explain to you that iâ€™m suffering. You are clueless to the demon that is killing me. Your unaware, because youâ€™ll never know. Iâ€™ll never tell you over our calls that iâ€™m causing my own death. Youâ€™ll notice next time you see me. Maybe iâ€™ll be too far gone by then. Its only 3 months till you get to see me again. Iâ€™ll hopefully be prettier, more appealing. Though iâ€™ll be at my worst, constantly trying to please something that will not be pleased till iâ€™m dead. 

I hope you talk to me more. I just wanna feel loved. I love talking to you, I donâ€™t care what about. I wanna exist along side you. I wanna understand your interests, but iâ€™m to stupid to. Iâ€™m dumb, iâ€™m sorry about that. All I can do is write and read. I write stories you donâ€™t wanna look at because theyâ€™re to sad. I write poetry that you would rather forget existed. Iâ€™m sorry that iâ€™m so dumb I canâ€™t understand your nerdy interest. I wanna know more, I wanna make you feel understood and listen to you ramble about nerd stuff, but iâ€™ll likely never understand it. You could explain it to me a million times and iâ€™d never wrap my head around it. 

 Iâ€™m sorry that i was hurt as a child, and though iâ€™ve healed, I still show signs of being a broken person. I thought I was healed enough, but I donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever be normal. The damage is too great. Iâ€™ll never write a happy story or a poem that youâ€™ll actually read. I write as a way of coping. Those characters you hate are just pieces of me. It makes me feel awful when you say you donâ€™t wanna know about my newest writing piece. But I understand, you wanna keep your peace. You donâ€™t crave sadness like everyone else in my life does. 

I donâ€™t know why weâ€™re together. You knew coming into this relationship I was a broken human being who will never stop being one. I bet you thought you could fix me. You canâ€™t piece me together. No amount of kindness and silly memes you send me will ever heal me completely. No amount of hand holding and kisses can piece my brain back together. I will forever be somewhat of a worrying person. Iâ€™ll have weird behaviors. Iâ€™ll say weird things. Thats just how I am. But for now, iâ€™ll stay quiet. Iâ€™ll let you believe that iâ€™m healed, that maybe iâ€™ve finally understood that you arenâ€™t meant to hear about my day to day concerns. I wonâ€™t let you know if iâ€™m hurt, i wonâ€™t let you worry over me. 

If your lucky youâ€™ll never have to worry about me ever again. Maybe youâ€™ll finally have the peace you want with someone who isnâ€™t like me. I bet youâ€™d be happier with someone who wasnâ€™t traumatized. I know I was never meant to be in love. Iâ€™m too hurt to have ever thought iâ€™d have the right to love another, or be loved. 

Iâ€™m sorry to my lover, S."
CPTSD,"Just found this sub. Some questions to help me get sleep, thanks for any advice","I havent had a good nights sleep in probably 10+ years.  The kind that you wake up from and feel good?  The reason being I spent 3 years over in Iraq and one night took a mortar to the side of the head.  While I dont suffer from nightmares (I almost never get deep enough to have dreams or nightmares, or stay asleep long enough), I am however a super light sleeper.  The VA diagnosed me with PTSD and Hypervigilance which means I'm on alert all the time.  It's a trigger that almost never turns off, even in my own home, though it tends to feel better being home than anywhere else.  


My sleep pattern is horrendous, the VA reported that I woke up 19-24 times a night, most of which I'm aware of because I'm tossing and turning.  To give an idea of how sensitive my sleeping is, turning my cell to vibrate and putting it on a padded table or couch will still wake me up.  I need to figure something out that will put me to sleep and help me stay there, I'm so tired of never having energy.    


Thank you for taking the time to read this and responding."
CPTSD,Cold and alone. Coping tools?,"I have to have a talk in the morning that Iâ€™m dreading. With an abuser I let follow, and live with me again after several failed years. 

Itâ€™s someone I love that I want to fix things with, but so much pain and time has been wasted. I need help, I need hope, I need loveâ€¦ My world is more than this but this takes all of me and more to carry. 

What helps you fall asleep or regain your night after horrible flashbacks and fearâ€¦"
CPTSD,I think my therapist is frustrated with me and so am I,"So basically I was in therapy today and my therapist and I are trying to figure out why I canâ€™t identify my emotions. Itâ€™s very hard for me to identify them and always has been. 

 I took a test regarding how certain situations affects my stress. It states I have a very low stress level that would say I donâ€™t need to be in therapy but here I am.

 We think it might be due to my PTSD (particularly due to years of dissociation) rather than my Depression. 

I cry during therapy but can hardly ever pinpoint why Iâ€™m feeling this way and/or where it stems from. I can tell sheâ€™s getting increasingly frustrated with me. I am too. It makes me want to give up and quit therapy.

 Thereâ€™s times when I can possible identify an emotion or guess where itâ€™s coming from or how I feel but Iâ€™m usually too scared to tell her and idk why. 

Thatâ€™s basically it. I donâ€™t know what to do and I hope this made sense."
CPTSD,Feel like I don't want to be here anymore,"I'm too sensitive to rejection and it makes reaching out for support impossible because there will always be people who will look at me and run away. The only people who are supportive are a handful of people online who don't even know my real name, remembering a long ago more whole version of myself that I used to be, a version that collapsed like a house of cards. I stripped my psyche to the bottom of my soul and found out just how early the rot started, and then I couldn't pretend to be okay any longer. I am drowning in shame. I am shattered into pieces and they have scattered to the winds. No one can put me together again, and without money, youth and good looks no one wants to try. I have deteriorated and deteriorated. There is no possibility of partnership or friendship; today's society is uncompromisingly shallow and cold. Compassion is extended to those who are deemed deserving. All my life there have people who said that I am a joke, and a victim, and that I don't matter. There is nothing to look forward to but physically decline. It's already started. I used to be attractive enough, but most days I look like a wraith waiting for the apocalypse. I don't know how to get back everything I lost. I researched and studied  hoping I could hold it together just enough that I could find allies before my heart gave out, but I didn't make it. I feel like I am already gone. I know it's a mistake in my programming, a damaged part, but you can't do brain surgery on your own head. Help is not coming, only long years of fading and being rejected and illness. I don't think I can do it anymore, but I don't have the will to take myself out. I don't think that's a positive  anymore. I am scared to death of the shadow looming over me. I don't really want to die, I just really want to live."
CPTSD,does anyone ever wonder if they are a covert narcissist?,"I don't identify much with grandiose narcissism, but I think I can be really self absorbed. I'm really triggered by the dynamic of my workplace, there's lots of (perceived) uncertainty of if I'm doing good at my job, clique-y coworkers, I find myself holding my breath waiting for my boss to blow up at me over mistakes, I worry constantly I'm not accepted by my coworkers or that I'm the 'oddball' of the team. My thought patterns are deeply selfish. I know no one is scrutinizing me at work and yet I cannot stop worrying about this and I'm 24/7 worried I'm about to get fired. I am deathly afraid of being fired. I've felt this way about every job I've ever had.

Has anyone worried or feared they were a narcissist? I want to ask my therapist but this worry is even more of what I've written above. I'm just constantly self absorbed and wondering what people think of me."

CPTSD,"Husband canâ€™t stop triggering me, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m cut out for relationships.","I love my husband with everything I have. But at the same time, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m healthy enough to maintain our relationship. 

He cusses all the time, and I generally donâ€™t cuss as much. Iâ€™m not like some puritan, but I just donâ€™t cuss very much. 

When he cusses in any sort of negative way, itâ€™s incredibly triggering. I feel so small, like Iâ€™m a little kid again with all those horrible things being said and done. He knows all this, but he still doesnâ€™t stop cussing. 

I try to just let it go, but sometimes itâ€™s just too much. Especially when itâ€™s directly at me, my brain just shuts down. Today, we were doing something pretty frustrating, and he started throwing around the cussing again. I started getting triggered, but tried not to say anything. Eventually, I start shutting down because itâ€™s too much, and he notices that Iâ€™m acting different. He can never tell when Iâ€™m scared, he always thinks Iâ€™m mad for some reason. So he starts getting real snippy with me, which makes me shut down even further. Eventually he cussed directly at me, basically I handed something to him from too far away. It hurt his back to reach that far, so he snapped at me and said â€œthat shit hurts!â€

That was pretty much my breaking point, brain function stopped entirely and all I could do was stand there mindlessly. But then he started hammering me with questions, â€œwhy are you doing this? Why are you acting this way?â€ And all I can do is half heartedly say that I was just trying to hand him the object. I was standing too far away because I was scared of him, but of course if Iâ€™d said that, everything would get much worse. So I just stand there. We move on and finish our task, and he goes to the bathroom and I take the opportunity to cry and get all the terror and hurt out of my system. 

I know that he just doesnâ€™t understand, he canâ€™t read my emotions so he doesnâ€™t understand that Iâ€™m afraid. Itâ€™s hard to change habits, especially stuff that comforts you, so I get that cussing when heâ€™s mad isnâ€™t some switch he can flip. It just hurts so much, Iâ€™m so sick of having to cope with fear constantly. He deserves someone stronger, who can handle something as simple as some bad words. My chest aches, I hate that feeling of seeing him as all those monsters from my past. Heâ€™s not those people, but my broken mind warps him into them when he scares me. I just wish I could scrub my brain clean and be normal. Iâ€™ll never get to be the strong, well adjusted person I could have been, and I hate how much it haunts me every single day. I hate being triggered by the person I love, because I know that itâ€™s the last thing he wants to do. I just want to run away and hide, and never be seen by another person ever again."
CPTSD,Do you guys ever have problems with idealizing and rationalizing when people treat you badly?,"I struggle with this a lot. When I was younger, I was being abused by my dad but I blamed myself for it. It took me a long time to admit to myself that he had hurt me and that the abuse wasn't my fault. I still feel guilty, like I'm making too big of a deal out of it. In my adult life, I struggle a lot when I am wronged, especially by someone I care about. It triggers me right into the thought process I had around my dad. I get confused about my reality... did they hurt me? Am I overreacting? Are they a bad person? Am I a bad person? I tend to convince myself I was wrong and shrink my hurt. It ends up being that I try to people please with them while feeling so much anger for them underneath. I also struggle immensely with standing up for myself. While I love all of my friends, I noticed that I can draw people who aren't very nice. Or rather, I don't stand up for myself when I'm hurt by another person, so any dynamics where I am being the one hurt in the relationship tend to continue. It's only recently I feel equal to my closest friends and not resentful of them because I can't stand up for myself and instead raging internally that they're not a good person."
CPTSD,Breaking point,"I fucked up. And now I feel trapped and utterly powerless.
.
My parents cornered me two days ago in this flat. Mother sat in front of the door and father locked me in. The last bus going to my work left and I knew I am going to be late at that rate. 
I honestly thought about jumping off and run, considering there was no other way to escape, but hey it was 3rd floor, I would be very dead. 
I panicked and panicked some more, tried to push my mother and tried to push open the door. Ny father interpreted that as an attack and started hitting me; world went black and I was in a fight mode.
If this would happen half a year before I would be drowned in guilt and self loathing; now, I was glad that I fought. 
It wrecked me. Throwing me out was in the question. I was scared and crying like never before.
Barely made it to work. Didnt drink at all. But I thought; I can get through this. Only my right thumb had a bit of a scab, otherwise no evidence of any fight.
I was a mess, but still did well enough, even if dehydratation was slowly making my head fuzzy.
And it didnt end well. 
There is a door with stuff, like in my leg level. They dont close well. And as per usual, I kicked it in forcefully to get it out of my way.
Well, I left out one detail; I kicked in the point of my thumb, too.
My right thumb.

Hurt more than I expected. Long story short; a painful bruise was left. Arnica during the night helped greatly. Honestly I thought they are not even going to take me seriously.

Well shit, I fucked up. One shock and cast later, I supposedly have broken? Cracked? Splinted? Who tf knows? A bit of that right thumb. It didnt hurt at all. But oh well.

Should be glad to rest, right?

I am right handed and an artist. I am going to artschool. I needed to get my projects done during these last days of the break. I am fucked. I cant write, I cant draw, I cant have fun, I cant create and work on my own projects, my joy, my future, and my only hope to leave that fucking job and never returning. 
I cant take my gf out on that ice skating date I was looking foward to. I can't go skating on my skateboard. I am utterly powerless and trapped within the confines of this stupid cast I don't even feel like I need. 
They didnt tell me how long I'll have to endure this thing on my arm. Frankly, the whole thing was a trainwreck, but that is just how my country's healthcare works.
I know Ill have to have a checkup in five days. Ill do my best to hopefully convince them I dont need this and have something less immobilising. 

I dont even give a shit about some lil fracture. Had one on my pinky, walked it off, nobody even knew. I cam deal with pain. I actually like pain. I indulge in it. What I do give shit about is creating and escaping this hell. What I do give shit about is school and half year. Two weeks is already long, and if they force a month upon me Ill get this off myself, no fucks given. 

I cant imagine my life without writing and drawing. Week, fine, will push through, two weeks, fuck, fine, month? No. I do not have a month. 
I cant take a month. My plans are already crumblingband Ill be so behind and everything is fucked and I am trapped in this stupid cast that I donr even know how long Ill have. I hate being trapped. Being trapped was what led me into this. I hate it. I hate being powerless, useless, worthless. 

I am stubborn, though. Typing this feels terribly slow, sorry for any typos if they are, and drawing feels quite bad and slow, but I will persist. Fuck this weak body I will fight. No matter what.

Even if I want to cry because my frustration, anger and sadness is belittled, ignored, mocked, shamed. I think I have right to feel things. After all, something I love has been taken for indefinite amount of time and deadlines are creeping up. After all, my joy has been taken from me and I was already spiraling long beforehand. 

Maybe I am oversensitive, overreacting. Maybe I am insane for wanting to break the cast and get rid of it. Maybe I am this and that. I dont care. I have to fight even if I know I am worthless right now and absolutely powerless and stuck in a situation there is no getting out of."
CPTSD,Emotional dissociative amnesia?,"I have a tendency in my relationships to totally emotionally forget about my partner when I havenâ€™t seen them for a few days.

My ex I was with for 6.5 years said I needed to â€œde thawâ€ or â€œwarm upâ€ to him for a few hours after I hadnâ€™t seen him for a few days. With my new partner, who Iâ€™ve been with for 7 months, the longer we go without seeing each other, even just for a few days, the less inclined I am to respond to his texts. I get to the point where I feel emotionally detached and donâ€™t want to answer his calls or even have physical contact with him when I first see him in person again. 

I donâ€™t feel this way with my friends or family â€” I feel like we pick up where we left off and I donâ€™t feel like I forget about them when weâ€™re not there. 

This is causing issues for me in the relationship because I donâ€™t like having to take time to get comfortable with him again, and it causes issues when weâ€™re apart because I basically forget who he is and feel odd texting him or talking on the phone.

Does anyone have a similar experience who can talk about what they did to improve it? Thanks!"
CPTSD,Facing the uncomfortable,"Been getting out of my comfort zone lately. Closing my door without closing it softly (not slamming it but not slowly pushing it in either), playing my Nu metal music out loud in my room, not turning down the music i listen to in my car when passing by people, talking out loud to myself even when people are around, not lowering my voice around people when talking on the phone, allowing myself to stutter around people or when Iâ€™m talking, and etc.

CPTSD,I feel like my life is worth nothing.,"I can't conceive that my death would truly make a difference to anyone.

I don't want to be told platitudes please - things like ""I can assure you that your life is worth it and you are valid"" etc etc.

I am just here to express a sentiment. I know exactly why I have it.

It's just astonishing to me. The other day someone told me about 2 people being kidnapped in a foreign country, and the authorities of their country of origin raising an international case to get them back.

I stopped for a minute because I automatically thought ""imagine if this was me"" and I simply could not imagine my life having that much value? Just the same way that I cannot imagine my friends organising a surprise birthday party for me...

Or imagine I did a fundraiser to pay for my doctors? And people actually valued my life enough to pay me? Or if I had a social media account (I don't) and people actually supported me in my struggles?

Unthinkable.

I am autistic, I can't connect with people, plus my face is wrong really, it inspires people to hate me before I open my mouth at all. I can't imagine a *group* of people actually genuinely valuing my life. This is unthinkable to me. 

I can't imagine people not finding me ridiculous, pathetic - some*thing* that is weird and deserves hate. I just cannot imagine myself being seen as more than that. ""Smart"" is more or less the only compliment I ever received. ""Smart"" but I always felt like no one would care if I die. Like it would be normal.

I am the exception. I just cannot feel like a person"
CPTSD,Feeling angry at realising the extent of my ptsd and it never being picked up on,"Tw: mentioning suicide

Is anyone else is a position where their trauma responses control their life/are so self-sabotaging and impactful every day if not nearly every day, but you were oblivious for so long and feel like an imposter because you've seen several counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, so on growing up and as an adult but they never saw it/validated it? I have found therapies like cbt so difficult but have been met with frustration when I couldn't do what was expected or communicate my feelings/explain what was wrong and when I shut down/had more appointments than allocated but didn't feel ready to leave the service.

Later in life diagnosed with adhd/asd traits for context. 

But every time I have a trauma response like self neglect and letting others walk all over me, not asking for my needs to be met, or engaging in things I'm not comfortable with or able to do regardless of how that affects me after, it's always been treat as if it's normal or something that everyone does. For a long time I believed everyone felt suicidal but that I just didn't handle it as well as they did and I believed it was because I was weak. Everyone has always been so annoyed, irritated or angry at me for struggling emotionally or not ""getting over it"" so I've suppressed it and felt incredibly uncomfortable, dissociated a lot and hid away, despite screaming inside then going past that to just complete apathy and being unable to engage in anything, self isolating and withdrawn.

I'm feeling so broken about it all, because I've never understood and it's never been validated.

I'm applying for financial support and I can't even explain my struggles properly because I was always told I was dramatic and ungrateful and needed to get over it (it being alexithymia, extreme overwhelm and sensory overload and more) and so I dumb down my experiences to make it easier for others and I tell myself I'm being dramatic or that it isn't that bad and other people have it worse so I just need to get over it (I'll be a burnt out suicidal mess, not coping but not able to reach out for help either, spiralling and hiding away but still not believing it's bad if that makes sense)

Is anyone else just so angry/bitter/hopeless and overwhelmed and in despair with their trauma?

CPTSD,I am actively being t0rtur3d. Help me.,"How can I leave? 

In the US. 23F. Social services won't help me because I am severely disabled. I can't make my own food and need household accomodations. At one point I had enough money to support myself for one year without working but could not find a place to rent because I had a gap in income and employment history from when I was trapped in a room and starved. Once I finally found a place, I couldn't go because no one helped me move. I hired five people and all five cancelled or ghosted. Now I have nothing. There are many, many, many similar events where I have had everything I needed except a path. All of this has been so stupidly preventable it is a CRIME that it was not stopped. Besides discrimination and rape culture, I geniunely can not understand how nothing has worked. It must be because everyone is terrible and evil and neglectful. If they do not help other people one hour a week then they have committed the heinous crime of neglect. 

I can't stress about bills. That would make my disability worse. I would die. My family destroyed my life intentionally, and if I stress about bills that would indicate that they got away with what they did. I know everyone stresses about bills but they have family. They have sanity. They aren't disabled. They were never a victim of torture. My disability is so severe I need a higher level of care than an assisted living facility. I can't stress about bills. I can't stress about people not wearing covid masks. I have geniuneinely never met a person who has gone through what I've gone through and made it out. The closest comparable people had something that I didn't.

How do I leave? There are millions of solutions. I could co-found an assisted living facility or care giving service. I could co-found a mutual aid group and have someone find a place to squat that has the accommodations I need and dumpster dive food for me. I could move to a country with a lower cost of living. I could make a Go Fund Me. None of those things are things I can do without support. Support to ensure that, if I have everything I need, there is a path to use it. That there isn't some ridiculously stupid, solveable thing that doesn't get solved and destroys everything I have worked on for months.

I feel like starting a protest. Making a list of demands. I want a healthy family. I want money. I want food. I want medical care. I want a safe place to live. And if I don't get that, I'll do something that I don't want to say out loud. Please give me options. I'm begging you.

CPTSD,I said no to my mom for the first time after a lifetime of assumptions that I'm always available at her beck and call.,"Well, half said no. 

I'm sure you folks are familiar with this dynamic of assuming the other person is going to say yes to your request because you're supposed to be dependable and reliable and if you said no then you also lose the ability to ask them for anything.

Or maybe that's just a toxic thing my mom does.

But anyway, she tried to drop this on me with 3 days notice that I'm supposed to babysit her dog for 72 hrs a week from Monday until June. Just assumed I would say yes. This sent me into complete shut down. I wanted to skip town I was so anxious, I was willing to cut everyone off!

But I was able to speak to my therapist and she helped regulate me and was able to show me how I actually had a choice in this situation and it wasn't as helpless as I thought. 

So I told my mom that I can do 1 day a week and I'll help her find a sitter. No over explaining, no apologizing, it was a short and sweet reply to her text. I didn't want to leave her completely high and dry. 

I'm so fucking dysregulated again. My nerves are shot, I'm hot and sweaty and then I'm clammy and cold, I had a 2 hr sleep attack, nausea, diarrhea, I feel like I want to skip town again. I don't have the means the skip town but it's my mental substitute for sui ideation.

CPTSD,Wasit really bad enough?,"I grew up emotionally and physiologically abused. I went through 8 years of counseling and boundary setting and finally set no contact back in November with my whole family. It has been peaceful but I've been overwhelmed with guilt. Was it really so bad I needed to go no contact? My partner of 8 years confirms that it was but I'm still stuck feeling like the bad guy.

The holidays were hard. My family would always order chinese food(we live in Canada)for new years eve and I couldnâ€™t eat it cause it upset my stomach aside from one dish from one specific restaurant. But they always picked somewhere else cause my aunt didnt want to order from there so I was stuck eating grilled cheese for supper. Someones preference(for no other reason than ""didnt want to order from there"") was more important than me being able to eat something from a restaurant and being included. 

This was one of few examples my brain is able to conjure up because for some reason I cant remember other specific things. My parents had unreasonable expectations and they guilt tripped and compared us siblings. But specifically I struggle to pull up more than a half dozen memories to prove that I was treated badly.

I guess im just weighed down by guilt about it all. I dont even know why Im making this post."
CPTSD,Can anyone relate to this?,"About once a week or so i wake up feeling like something is wrong, and slowly throughout the day i get more and more agitated, until i experience a wave of emotion, and words that i didnt get to say to my psychotic brother when i was a child come out of me, and torrents of pain and intrusive thoughts.

The words are â€œyouâ€™re not my friend!â€ Followed by a ton of rage, and then i go into another set of anger and grief at my mother for leaving me alone with him. Itâ€™s the same set of feelings every time, but itâ€™s as if it has to percolate through a ton of my dissociation to arise. Iâ€™m wondering if you experience something similiar, and if you have any words for it."
CPTSD,No memories of being abusive - please share resources,"Hi,   
I searched the internet about not having memories of arguments, shouting and physical abuse - but they always speak about the victim not remembering that, I need info about the ABUSER not remembering the fights.   
   
Could you give me some resources about not remembering being the abuser? For the first time I had an idea - could my mum have cptsd? Could the dissociation during her own emotions be just dissociation because of trauma? Please, are there any resources about people with cptsd being abusers themselves with frequent dissociations? I have read about it only in the context of military people...  


TRIGGER WARNING - physical abuse of kids  
I mean abuse like kicking, hitting, dragging your children, calling them names and \*name all horrible personality traits\*, hysterically overreacting about minor inconveniences (child wanting something, child speaking in the car, child having a nightmare) and blaming others for whatever happening, all during hysterical shouting. Complete inability to apologise (partly probably because of the missing memory) and all is triggered by stress, self-doubt and insecurity, helplessness. The reactions are unpredictable, depending on the mood - one day may go shitty and she is still fine, other days even a small event causes mayhem.   
It would also help me if there is someone with similar experience. We are 3 kids I (F29) and brothers (M19 and M15). We have blurred memories, but I know for sure that the pieces I remember happened and so does my brother. During this Christmas, a common family fight turned in an unexpected therapy direction and I told my brother that our mum does not remember how she beated him regularly and shouted at him almost every day when he was little. Both mum and brother were genuinely surprised. Of course, she does not believe it, but she wants to go to therapy or hypnosis or something to remember.   
And I am scared, I didnÂ´t plan on telling her, I told my brother because at that moment he wanted her to acknowledge the beating and he was getting desperate that she did not. When she is confronted with even minor wrongdoing, she tries to blame everyone else and when that is not possible, she starts a self-pity journey ""I am the worst person/mother/daughter/wife on the planet"".   
I do not blame her, it may be biology, I know she has had trauma in the past (death of her father when she was a teen, dramatic relationship with her mother - they lived together all her life). But I donÂ´t know much about her - she was never the person to share emotions with and neither I nor my brothers have a close emotional relationship with her and she has no idea.

CPTSD,Memory issues,"Going through a divorce. He has narcissistic behaviours. At some point in a 3 month stonewalling period, he said I've had memory issues for quite some time. I asked him if he was concerned about my memory, why didn't he tell my parents or someone else?

Basically, I overheard him telling a guest at our house that he is diabetic. I was in another room at the time and I panicked. I  did not know he was diabetic and most times I only learn things about him when he is speaking to others; not me. 


He had to remind me of us going to his dietitian together and me creating a diet plan I put on the fridge, pre Pandemic.

I could then remember doing those things.

Somehow, I legitimately overheard his conversation about being diabetic as new news. I went into shock and panic at the time.

CPTSD,"Questions about some childhood behaviors and current anxieties, Tw for talk of childhood masturbation, violent intrusive thoughts, violence toward animals as a child, anxieties about sex, abusive toilet training, and inappropriate touching of one child by another child","Hello everyone. I'm starting to try to figure out whether I have some unremembered trauma. I do have some remembered trauma, but for the past fifteen years at least, I'm thirty-four, I've been wondering if there is something else. A few weeks ago I discussed some of my childhood behaviors with my therapist, and she's saying that they are a strong indication that there is something I'm not remembering and that the remembered trauma's elements don't explain them.
The behaviors are as follows.
FIRST, the childhood masturbation. I started around the age of three or four. I don't remember doing the typical self exploration that a child does, I just remember knowing that masturbation was a thing I could and wanted to do, and that I needed to hide from others while I did it. I masturbated at least once a night and once a day, often more times than that, and always to climax. My therapist is saying that children that young don't typically masturbate so often and not to climax, but other stuff I've read says it's perfectly normal.
I also developed Pure O OCD at around three or four, and the typical onset for a child is between twelve and fourteen. My intrusive thoughts always manifested as violent urges which were accompanied by intense remorse. And between the ages of three and nine I would sometimes act on my violent intrusive thoughts toward animals. I never killed or badly enjured an animal, but I feel so sick thinking about what I did do. And the thing about OCD intrusive thoughts is that the person having them never ever acts on them, and I don't know if I did because I was so young and didn't know how to regulate, or if I'm wrong about them being OCD related.
I also remember feeling intense, seemingly random anxiety that I had no safe place to be or person to go to. But both of my parents were and are loving and attentive, as were my grandparents and aunts and uncles. My dad could be emotionally and verbally abusive, but not to the point of calling me names or insulting me.
I also had some phobias as a child. One was of balloons. The other was of battery acid and only lasted for about a year, but while it existed there were times where I was afraid my parents were poisoning me with it, even though I knew they weren't.
The two traumas I can remember are being toilet trained by my dad who always got very angry and ragey and shaming toward me when I had accidents, this was from age three to six. I'm pretty sure some of the accidents were due to encoprasis. And the other trauma memory is of being on a bus at the age of four and an older child touching me inappropriately. But my therapist doesn't feel that that explains the childhood masturbation because it was not done in secret and it didn't feel pleasurable, so wouldn't have intrigued me to masturbate.
The current sexual anxieties are this. I'm having trouble Being present in the moment when my fiance and I are having sex. I don't know if it's always dissociation, but there are definitely times when it has been. I'm able to feel fully present and aroused when we're slowly starting out with touching and kissing, but once it moves passed that I usually stop feeling pleasure and feeling present. And when I masturbate I usually have to think of very spacific things in order to climax, but now some of those things are starting to feel triggering to think about, even though I still need them.
Thank you so much for reading, and any thoughts and insight you're able and willing to share would be greatly appreciated.
If there's anything I need to clarify I'm happy to do so, I know this is a bit disjointed."
CPTSD,I donâ€™t mean to bragâ€¦.,"But Iâ€™ve made my psychologist take off his glasses, scratch his head and literally say â€œfuckâ€ 4 times.

CPTSD,suicidal / freeze mode and missed 3 days of work - should I tell my bosses why?,"I guess Iâ€™m just putting this here because I need an outlet. Iâ€™m currently stuck in an extreme freeze triggered by my nmotherâ€™s antics, Iâ€™ve not gone back to work since new years so thatâ€™s 3 days ive missed unable to really explain why (the first day I just said gastro) and Iâ€™m currently very hyper dysregulated but unable to actually DO anything cus Iâ€™m stuck in a freeze which I know from recent therapy is my body protecting myself while my brain is in suicidal mode.

I donâ€™t even know whether or how to let my employers know the real reason (itâ€™s a law firm we have a strict number of days we can take off leave and itâ€™s an East Asian city so access to suicide prevention help is not easy to get instantly) because theyâ€™re awful about sick leaves I know from hearing it firsthand they talk shit (more like the bosses yell behind closed doors but everyone can still hear) whenever someone takes a sick leave

the whole thing is making me very anxious. thought of going in is making me anxious thought of not going in is making me anxious, I really just want to end feeling this way.

I have just spent like 17+ hours in bed everyday the whole weekâ€¦ forcing myself to get up to eat or do basic needs

donâ€™t really know what to do. thatâ€™s all. 

I have already messaged my therapistâ€™s office for an appointment but no response yet. 

calling Samaritans freaks me out bc if any Extreme Measure is taken Iâ€™m scared of repercussions from my parents

Iâ€™m so sick of having this sort of response when I am in a high state of anxiety and dysregulation"
CPTSD,Am I a jerk?,"Am I a jerk for not only not wanting to forgive my father but also not liking him, despite the fact that he really changed for the better?

For some background info: my dad isn't the main cause of my CPTSD, mainly he gave me daddy issues, attachment issues. I'm not even sure if what he did can be qualified as ""trauma"". I leave it up to you to tell me. 
When I was a kid (age maybe 6-12?) I felt like my dad pushed me away (I'm saying that I felt like this because no one can confirm it, my twin brother doesn't have the same experience as me even though he was the same towards us pretty much). I'll get into the details and tell you what he was doing:
- due to stress at work he used to baste at us, by blowing up over small things and raising his voice a lot. My mom said that it wasn't that bad and said I probably felt like it was because of my sensory issues and hearing sensitivity, but I'm not sure.. I still remember the nightmares that I had because of that. I was pretty scared to ask for anything because I couldn't recognise what mood he was in (I'm autistic) which meant that if I encountered him angry would mean he would yell at me.
- He made me feel like he didn't love or like me; I constantly felt I was annoying, weird or dumb. Sometimes I even considered myself useless. I still crumble whenever he expresses at least a bit of annoyance.
- Whenever I misbehaved, instead of talking to me, he would take away the most important stuff to me or threatening to take them away. He still does that somehow but in a different way.. (last time I told him I didn't want to shave my legs because its my body my choice, he said that in that case, he won't be going to the store with me even though he knows I'm really scared to go alone because it's his body his choice)
- He never really took interest in anything I did when I was a child; he never listened about my friends, school, my interests. All he did was scroll through social media or watch TV while I talked, which quickly made me realise what I'm saying was not important at all. 
- As I mentioned, I'm autistic (late diagnosed) which means I often don't understand jokes. And he sometimes made really cruel jokes. Sometimes he would punch me or just do something, sometimes it did hurt a bit (it never was a hard punch nor anything abusive or dangerous. It was just unpleasant sometimes, especially when I didn't want to be touched) He would also push me away whenever I needed a hug, as a joke but at the time I didn't always get that and sometimes it really upset me (didn't show it though). His last joke was throwing a backpack full of book at me when I was laying in my bed. 
- The last thing I remember that really hurt when was I cut myself for the first time and he looked at me like he was ready to disown me. Maybe it's not that bad because I get it how you can be dissapointed that your child is doing something like this I guess. It just hurt when he told me to think how will I look with such ugly scars, or when he looked at me with almost disgust in his eyes.

These are the major things that I remember that I think made me feel the worst. I don't want to make him look like a monster because those things are not that bad I guess. Anyway, he changed. He became more affectionate and he started caring about me and my personal life. He became a better person I guess.

That's where my question comes from; am I a jerk for not forgiving him and not liking him? Cause I feel awful that the thing I was most scared of as a child (being disliked by him) is what I am now doing to him. 

Please be brutally honest with me, I really need it."
CPTSD,Growing,Sometimes when you are in a dark place you think you have been buried but actually you have been planted.
CPTSD,Does this trigger you guys too?,"Being threatened by an authority figure. Examples:

* Boss from work implying that they will fire you 
* Landlord threatening to kick you out 
* Teacher threatening to punish you

Pretty much any authority figure, small or big. Even people who dont have actual authority, but can assert dominance by using tough words, increasing their volume or mild threats.

It feels like they have this threat card ready to play, and you would do anything to please them so they wouldn't. They have the gun to your head, and you can either go and fight a hopeless fight, or obey them and lose with minimal damage."
CPTSD,Appointment Tomorrow,"I've got a medical appointment tomorrow for a wound that isn't healing. I've had it for a very long time at this point and I don't know that it poses an immediate threat to my health (been seeing doctors about it for months). I am in the midst of a really bad episode. I have a shit ton of hospital/medical trauma, and getting the wound looked isn't easy under more normal circumstances. I've been waiting to see this specialist for like 4ish months now. I'm tempted to cancel cause I know its going to fuck with me and I don't feel I can rely on people for support right now outside of online stuff. Any advice? Suggestions? My plan right now is to try to white knuckle it and go and to have some CBD and get some food or something after if I feel like I can eat to comfort myself."
CPTSD,Is this a bad sign in a therapist? I've only had a handful of sessions with her so far.,"I was describing to my therapist that my psychiatrist told me to 'think good thoughts, be positive' and how it felt so invalidating, and dismissive to my trauma. She said that it was important to remember that not all people understand things through the same experiences, and that my psychiatrist was probably saying things to the best of his knowledge, without awareness of my specific trauma. This comment really irked me, and felt like she was playing devil's advocate, or justifying his inconsideration - but is this how it comes across to you? Note: My psychiatrist is clueless as to what CPTSD is, and isn't the best, and I did mention this to my therapist.

CPTSD,My childhood really fucked me up,"During my childhood my father would always yell at me and my brother at our family farm. He would always just tell us we were dumber than a box of rocks and stuff of that nature. All of this was very traumatizing. I have always been very emotional ever since i was a child, I remember in kindergarten I would always cry because I missed my mother. Now I'm 19 and still very emotional with extreme anxiety and depression and I always view things in black and white like you either are quite fond of me or u hate me. I never really realized how much just instances like that could fuck up my entire life. My father is way better now but that obviously doesn't change the fact of what happened. Recently I told him about this and he said basically ""yeah its all my fault"" very sarcastically. I don't know how to cope with all of this. Idk with this is the right sub for this but yeah just wanted to tell yall"
CPTSD,Feeling like being a hermit is best,"(Sorry for the extremely sad rant. I just need to get this off my chest and out of my head)

I've been isolated too long and am 
generally too weird to be walking around on the street. Too many encounters where people act afraid of me and are repelled by my face. I look at myself on bad days and I see what they see: someone who has been hollowed out by too many years in intense pain and anxiety, someone whose light has died. I held it off for as long as I could, tried to fake it until I could make it, but after the last traumatic relationship and the rejection I felt during my last PHP I couldn't convince myself that I was worth knowing. I internalized it all and decided that I was the problem, that something about my aura turned people and situations toxic and that it was better if I stayed away from everyone. I might have been okay if I had even one safe person to hold me, if I belonged to some people somewhere. I needed evidence that I was good and that I mattered, but I got confirmation of the opposite. My therapist periodically suggests I join a group, not grasping the fact that people react negatively to me unless I am extremely focus and actually self-confident, that people can sniff out when I am anxious and uncomfortable, which is most of the time. Been there, done that. Why in the world would I put myself into a position to be rejected, seeing expressions of fear and disgust all around me, when that is what is destroying me? The PHP was a place that had been a refuge, but the last time I went I got avoided and ignored by clients and counselors alike. That's really what finished me off; when the only place where I did belong cut me off and stopped supporting me.

I am not a bad person. I don't lash out at people. I'm thoughtful, don't make a fuss about things, believe that all creatures great and small have a place in this universe, and that we are all one. But my face reveals that I have been rejected so much that I no longer believe in myself, and that I have thought about and seen too much of the dark side of human life. My face reveals the dark places that I went to when everyone I counted on turned away. I've been fighting to get back into the light; and I am better than I was, but when I have a bad day and people react it pushes me right back into the darkness.

I think I should be on antidepressants but because I have a diagnosis of bipolar I can't just ask my GP for them. The only times I have been so unstable that I had to be hospitalized every year were the years I was on antipsychotics, which would be the first (probably only) medication that I am allowed to have. I used to have a pdoc who worked with me on this, but he retired years ago, and most pdocs these days don't accept my insurance. 

I haven't given up on myself. I believe that I can regain belief in myself. I am working hard to figure my shit out. I just need people to stop acting like I am the antichrist. At this point I am wondering if I do need an exorcism. This world has no tolerance for people in acute distress. It makes me sicker to be treated this way. 

Life is a long hard slog."
CPTSD,Brainstorm: panic attack self-soothing substitution,"I have regular panic attacks. They are worsened by my sleep apnea. I tend toward addictive behaviors like gaming, gooning (let's just call that masturbating with porn for you non-degenerates), weed, amd doomscrolling. I also pace. Please give me your ideas for self-soothing in ways that will help me regulate quickly without harming my brain's reward circuitry.

Meditation, music exercises (I play an instrument, barely), and breathing exercises are things I have already thought of."
CPTSD,Sometimes I wish I was born into a mafia family,"I know this sounds weird and stupid but let me explain.  
  
Unlike most people here, I was never abused in my biological family. My parents didn't beat me, and there was no sexual violence.  
However, I was very much neglected. So much so that I didn't bond with my parents and when they died when I was 11 (my mother died in front of me), I didn't care at all. I never mourned my deceased parents because I didn't feel the need to do so.  
However, I am a traumatized person. Already in my early childhood, I experienced painful physical, emotional and even sexual violence (I was molested by a group of boys), but not from my parents, but from strangers; peers, other adults, other family members (e.g. cousins). I remember my early childhood very badly, I remember that almost every day I came back crying or bruised because I was beaten, stones were thrown at me, I was choked and kicked. Sometimes I had to run away from home even in winter because I was running away from the violence of family members who came to visit us.  
I was also severely humiliated, for example, in the presence of my parents, some people told me to wait ""for my turn"" to enter the house (under threat of beating up), first letting my dog and cat in, and then letting me in...  
My parents knew which people were hurting me, sometimes it was just other children, and they did absolutely NOTHING about it, knowing that I came home every day and cried. I didn't trust my parents and after some time I stopped telling them what was happening to me, it was pointless. They never found out about the sexual harassment.  
I will write a little about my parents;  
They were poor. My father was an alcoholic (he stopped drinking when I was born, but he drank a lot before that), but not the ""dangerous"", aggressive one that everyone is afraid of because he gets into fights. Dad was the type of alcoholic that everyone laughed at. The kind that little bullies come up to and tease. NOBODY respected my family. My parents also had no respect for themselves, which made it very easy for other outsiders to abuse me because... why not?  
I have an older brother (I no longer have contact with him) who used to be better off, he had money and sometimes gave us food, me and our parents. Often the food was spoiled and moldy, and my mother took it and ""didn't complain.""  
  
My parents were weak and pathetic, they couldn't defend me, and because of their weakness, I became a victim of violence, because absolutely everyone knew that they could laugh at us and that they could do whatever they wanted to me.  
  
Currently, I am 29 years old, traumatized, I have no successes in life and extremely low self-esteem. Somewhere deep in my core, I loathe myself for my origins. I am disgusted with my name, my family, my ""identity"". I cannot think of myself as anything other than a punching bag, the weakest unit in the herd, I have the impression that this ""submission"", ""slave mentality"" towards other people is written in my genes somewhere. That I MUST be like my parents, because it's probably genetic.  
  
I recently had a conversation with my partner, during which I came to the conclusion that I would 10,000 times more prefer to be born into the family of some mafia boss than into my own, pathetic and weak one. Everyone respects such families out of fear and everyone knows not to  bully gangsters' children at school. No one will rape the daughter of a mafia boss because he will be tortured and killed. I know I'm probably making it a bit harsh now, but I don't mean anything to the frustration I feel about having the family I had and for which I'm terribly ashamed.  
  
Every day I drift off and escape into a world of fantasy in which I imagine the same scenarios from my past, only with a strong, masculine, often aggressive and even ""psychopathic"" figure next to me, who protects me against other people's aggression.DAILY...

CPTSD,I feel like a horrible person,"There's literally nothing good in me.

I'm ugly and gross, fat, I have lots if scars and pumples and skin issues and its repulsive to see me, I sweat a lot and have lots of body hair and my face proportions are just wrong, my breath is bad no matter how much I brush my teeth and care for my bocal hygene, in adittion my hair always looks wild and not in ""the good way"", its always fucking tangled, and my genitalia is just putrid to sum up. 

Inside I'm not better, I'm so selfish, I only think about me and I don't even care about it or if I hurt others, and I always hurt others, I spend the day doing bad things, I only have one friend and I'm sure she doesn't even like me that much because why would she tbh? And I'm always so insensitive, I have no empathy or anything like that even if I try and I have no social skills and I hate almost everyone in the world even tho I'm the worst human on earth and I'm so sensitive about everything, I try to be strong, I spent years without crying, literally fucking years and now I sry about everything, I'm so dumb to, I don't know how I managed to get my basic education, weak, stupid, akwward, insensitive, slefish and also a coward, I could be desde by now and not bothering others but here I am, alive because I wasn't brave enough, and the worst thing is I kind of like being alive, I'm learning how to live a happy life that I don't deserve at all.
I'm sick, I have cptsd and there's no fucking cure for it, just therapy and I don't want to go I already did and it didn't do shit, and I'm incapable of finding a cure even tho im trying but I'm so dumb that I know I won't ever find it


I have a boyfriend that loves me or at least he tells me that, I belive him even tho it's difficult sometimes to understand why, but I keep hurting him, he tells me it's not that much and sometimes it ""isn't even my fault"" bur I know e only says that because he doesn't want to hurt me and/or he's just too nice, he's literally a fucking angel and im just me.

I don't know why I wrote this, I guess I needed to vent a little, I know however I don't deserve to do it or feel better but as I said, I'm just selfish."
CPTSD,CPTSD makes me feel like I'm never alone (not in a good way),"It's sucks. As an introvert, I need a lot of alone time. The thing is, I never feel alone, like there is always someone out to get me. Like my abusers are always with me. I miss sitting alone on a bench by myself contemplating life. You know that feeling after watching a horror movie and you feel like a ghost is with you? It's like that but worse. I miss the feeling of being independent. If you see me, I look like a loner but I'm not. it feels like I have ghosts haunting me 24/7.

Idk if this makes sense"
CPTSD,"Current partner is trying to get me to stop apologising for talking ""too much"" but it's something I've been punished for so many times","I'm a pretty enthusiastic and excitable person, I also have ADHD which im sure makes it worse. Im really self-conscious about talking too much if I get carried away. I've always been softly spoken and when I was a kid it took me a long time to feel safe talking to someone, as an adult I'm less scared of other people but I hate being annoying or rude or making people feel like they don't get a chance to talk. When I feel like I've got carried away and talked too much I feel really guilty and embarrassed so I apologise a lot and don't want to talk anymore. 

My partner doesn't like this, he says he doesn't want me to apologise because from his perspective I'm not doing anything wrong and he wants to hear what I have to say. I'm trying to stop apologising but it's honestly really hard. 

I haven't really discussed it with him because I dont particularly want to get into it, but it's really hard to let go of this fear because so many people have taught me. My most recent ex used to twist my fingers under the table if he thought I was being too excitable and we were out in public, he broke my fingers more than once and he continued doing it while they were broken. I *genuinely* appreciated it and thanked him for doing it because I thought he was teaching me how to be more normal and less annoying to people around me. I thanked him for helping me and I didn't really think until recently that it was anything other than 100% justified. I grew up in an environment where I wasn't supposed to speak without permission, then I ended up in the care system and I got rejected by so many people. It was so hard for me to build up the courage to talk so if I got told to shut up or punished it broke my heart. 

Most of the abuse I experienced was sexual so I feel like this is such a small stupid thing to be so fucked up about, it seems really minor compared to some of the other stuff. I know i wouldn't feel like that if it was someone else, but for me I just feel like I should get over it. There's also a huge part of me that thinks I actually probably *am* super annoying and *should* be called out on it. I'm not saying anyone deserves to be hurt or locked in rooms or whatever just because they're annoying but I still feel like I should be apologising and trying to be less chatty. 

I know my partner wants me to stop apologising and clam up less, and I want to try, but it's really hard because I feel like I've done something wrong and when you do something wrong you apologise and try to do better, right? 

I'm sure this must be a common issue for others here, does anyone have any idea what I could do?"
CPTSD,I canâ€™t handle people who think itâ€™s okay to hit kids,"Itâ€™s less about my childhood trauma, and more so that I have a big fucking heart and extremely empathetic. Tbh I was barely even hit growing up, more threatened to be hit than anything, thatâ€™s not where my trauma is. 

But I literally feel so paralyzed knowing some people still think hitting kids is an okay discipline method. And itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve know some really kind empathetic happy people who were hit growing up, so I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ruin their lives, but them being hit isnâ€™t WHY they turned out to be such a good person. They wouldâ€™ve turned out that way regardless, as long as whatever love they had growing up remained. Itâ€™s annoying how people confuse correlation and causation, like just because a kid was abused growing up doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll end up being abusive. Seeing a kind respectful person doesnâ€™t mean they grew up with kind respectful parents. Just like how being loving, respectful, caring, sometimes your kid will end up toxic anyways, but even then that doesnâ€™t mean they wouldâ€™ve been better if they got hit as disciplineâ€”-in fact theyâ€™d probably be worse off. You get better results when your kid feels safe, and you give them a balance of freedom and structure, one that works for them. 

And when it comes down it, Iâ€™d trust a kid raised on authoritative (gentle parenting), during like a purge or whatever, VS a kid raised on authoritarian (fear/pain based) or permissive. Because gentle parented kids have better morals."

CPTSD,"After all this time I can't answer this question,can you?","Before I start ,please no cruelty stories. We all know what goes on,and we don't need to hear them.
I want to ask if any of you are completely  unable to seperate yourself from the cruelty and injustice in the world. I'm amazed sometimes how these happy,clapoy,optimistic oeople can't actually FEEL the pain ,despair and bewilderment out there. That they can create their own little world and blick out all the rest. 
I have stories in my head that I read over 40,50,60 years ago that will never leave me. Every day I risk going onto face book or u tube and just seeing a image that will just add to this build up of sorrow and despair.
My thing is animals,neglect,cruelty,even nature at its cruelest. Also stories of abused children,old people. I think I relate so deeply to vulnerability. I remember reading,years ago,of a teenage girl who commited suicide because she couldn't bear to live in a world full of cruelty. 
It's there,everywhere,and most people can shut it out. I cant watch nature programs because I can't believe ,if there is such thing as God that he could allow such suffering to innocent creatures. 
I'm old now,but I've never got over this, I hate the world.  I've never reallynfound a way to blick out the horror. I think maybe what we went through made us very sensitive to vulnerability. Can anyone relate? Are we the ones that seethe world how it really is? I just don't know. X"
CPTSD,Those who have recovered from CPTSD. Do you have advice/suggestions on which therapist style helped you?,"Hi ! 

Prior to realizing I had CPTSD, I was diagnosed with Depression. I did CBT Therapy and this helped greatly for (unbeknownst to me) surface level issues (general negative thoughts & catastrophizing). 

After resolving surface level issues & being on anti-depressants. I am now ready to receive extensive therapy for core issues.

I'm assuming Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is the next step? I'm unsure of these different types of therapies since there seems to be a lot of variety/types (?).  

is my first goal to get a hold of a trauma therapist? Is that how this works? Are all trauma specialist the same? Are there specific types? 

I've been trying to google research but.. I think I'm over whelmed, any input would be appreciated!

Thank you for your help!"
CPTSD,How did I get so unlucky in life?,"How did I get so unlucky in life to be born into an abusive family? To add onto that, they were Mormons. Why couldn't I have been born into a normal functioning family? Why me? Now I have to spend the rest of my life dealing with all the abuse from my childhood. The truth is your body doesn't ever fully heal from abuse especially incest. It carries with you until the day you die . Life is ridiculously unfair, and those that are born into a loving family are able to be more successful in life. What kinda fucked up planet do we live in? Stuff like this makes me not believe in a higher power."

CPTSD,Another Layer,"I recently started attending restorative yoga, a practice of releasing the iron grip and expanding. Today, I wrap myself in a blanket. A layer, or a few, have been removed. What is beneath is so raw. So tender. I feel like all of my skin has come off. Like a crab without a shell. I want to wrap myself in bandages with some warm healing ointment on the inside and just hold myself. Who knows for how long. Everything is raw. Everything is open. Iâ€™m like a new born baby and I desperately need my swaddle. I try to lean into the rawness but I am afraid that if I do I will met with more. And more. And more. Iâ€™m aggressive in everything that I put my mind to and healing is no exception. I try to slow down. To be patient. But it is as if the great unraveling has begun and there is no stopping it now. If anything, it is gaining momentum. I reach inside myself to find her. The one who knows Iâ€™ll be okay. The one who knows I have already survived the worst. That Iâ€™m safe now. That this is just the residual shit. Oh it fucking hurts. But I close my eyes and I turn towards trust. I didnâ€™t come this far to turn back now. "
CPTSD,How did you learn that you have CPTSD?,"Just curious how people ended up here. It seems that CPTSD is getting a lot more recognition these days and I wonder where people are finding out they have it. I learned about it about 10 years ago from a therapist, but it was considered very fringe at that point. She pointed me to towards Surving to Thriving which opened my eyes to everything. Curious how others figured it out.

edit- Also curious if anyone has found through a doctor (in the US) since it isn't really technically recognized here. I have been cautious to bring it up with doctors in the US, instead always option for ""having very bad PTSD"", but my most recent session with a doctor I said CPTSD and they acknowledged it as a real thing!

&#x200B;"
CPTSD,"Narcissism, lack of empathy, etc","So I'm studying a lot of material related to CPTSD which fits my symptoms.

Obviously more therapy will be needed but I'll still ask in this sub. 

I was led this way because of a failed relationship where I was (some of it I can see some of it eludes me and it's a process) the abuser because I did most things to make myself feel good, even offering help that didn't feel right but due to feeling I will be a bad unlovable person if I don't which lead to toxic covert passive-aggressiveness and when confronted all the stress responses and defense mechanisms under the sun (tho only in extreme instances). 

Yes I fell in love (which I don't even know if I experienced before because I believed I didn't deserve it and would murder my feelings) but then how I actually treated her was predominantly transactional. 

It's also worth mentioning I recently talked to my father (I overhead a conflict between my parents while being busy trying to dissociate until I started getting progressively angrier over what I was hearing) and talking to him then felt like talking to a program regurgitating scripts. I was shaking and electric with rage and he seemed calm. In this relationship I witnessed myself do something similar which made me not only aware of how they might've felt but also afraid I might be mentally ill. 

I was often labeled Narcissistic. 

I was told I lack empathy, that I have extreme self-compassion (when I said I don't have it at all and learning to take care of myself) and self-centeredness (this I recognize and I'm ashamed of it) and also sadism because when it started to hit me what I've done and felt relief and catharsis over the pain caused where the focus went from my own hurt of what I didn't get to where they were and how I self-serving I was at the expense of their well being but also the fact I saw and was aware of their suffering and proceeded to love-bomb instead (their words, I don't oppose but I try to understand what was happening in me, where it comes from, when, how to heal it so I don't hurt people unintentionally). 

I'm asking myself ""am I really that out of touch?"" and ""am I really so emotionally illiterate?"".

I'm at a stage where I'm aware of what I've done and the pain I caused just not feeling it (I do feel pain as I write but it's frozen in my throat which is also sore atm) and empathy is feeling what someone else feels. 

Am I really just that fucked up?

Can you really feel someone else's pain before you can your own? Can you be aware of someone's needs if you're so out of touch with your own because of abandonment and neglect?

I feel like my whole reality is shattering and I just want to love and live an embodied life.

They want me to feel their pain and it's the only reason they still talk to me.

And maybe I do feel their pain but I just suck at compassion. "
CPTSD,I low-key want to cry right now because I always feel NOT good enough all the time,"I finally made it out of my toxic household. Iâ€™m financially and physically away from my family and it has been a major win. I met an amazing partner and weâ€™re having a good time. He makes me feel safe and heâ€™s around to listen. I like him a lot and heâ€™s moving away soon. Iâ€™m also about to get my period but Iâ€™m so so emotionally overwhelmed. 

Despite all the progress I still donâ€™t feel good enough about myself. I donâ€™t have amazing impressive hobbies or amazing impressive achievements.

CPTSD,State Investigation into Crappy Childhood Fairy/Anna Runkle - PM me for investigator contact info,"About two years ago I enrolled in and quickly left CCFs paid monthly program after issues I had with the program. I reported it to a few places, about 10 months ago I was advised to report it to the California Board of Psychology. I did that and this week an investigator reached out to me and interviewed me for an hour. They are looking for other witnesses who were harmed by Anna, CCF, the program on her website, and/or her Facebook Group.

Please PM me and I will provide the information for the investigator who is with California Department of Consumer Affairs Division of Investigation. They've been assigned to investigate whether CCF and Anna Runkle are practicing therapy without a license by the California Board of Psychology. You'll be able to email the investigator and share your story, any evidence, and - most importantly - they will listen to what occurred in your interactions with CCF's program and how it impacted you.

If you have receipts from your membership, screenshots, and/or screen-recordings of group work or anything like that, those would also be very valuable to the investigation.

Thank you and hopefully, she will at least have to change how she's marketing her program or simply shut it down. This has been a long time coming. Two years for me and longer for many of you. I hope this news brings many of you relief, validation, and hope. There is still justice in the world and let's hope it is found in this case.

I have posted this announcement with the permission and knowledge of the investigator but any opinions expressed in this post are mine. To reduce spam or hate, you must reach out to me directly for their contact info and I will send you their email so you can schedule an interview with them."
CPTSD,Abusive parents making me crazy,"Hi, I really need to share this with someone who can understand what I'm talking about. In short, I discovered a few years ago that I probably have CPTSD, mainly because I was forced to live with emotionally immature and abusive parents.

A delusional, self-obsessed mother that punished me every time I did not reflect back the perfect, flawless mother image she wanted me to see. Controlling me with guilt to make sure I complied. She also used me to get the attention and active listening my father was unable to give her. She was always way too present in my life, but never really tried to understand or meet my needs.

On the other hand, my father always acted as if I did not exist, and as if having a need for an actual father was abnormal. But he almost never failed to notice when I made the smallest mistake and shame me constantly for it. He even expressed that my very presence was undesired in passive agressive ways (heavy sight every 5mins when I was in a room he wanted to be, disgusted / annoyed facial expression when I was doing something I enjoyed and making a bit of noise etc). He acted like he was my mother's child. We were competing for her attention.

As a result I grew up as a people pleaser, an empty shell. Is hard to explain, but I did not grow an identity until \_decades\_ later. I stayed in stasis, being the perfect transparent kid, the perfect transparent student. The only thing I did for myself is numbing the pain and the loneliness in video games. Thats how I survived emotionally. Most of the time I was living to ""please adults"". Make them feel good about themselves. I was not a person, just a tool. Rest of the time, I escaped in games.

Eventually, all the sadness, the anxiety, the emotions I was not allowed to express found their way out. I had some sort of late ""teenage crisis"" moment in my 20s. I wanted to live, to find out who I was, to have pleasure. Since then, my parents not only abandonned me but became hostile.

I became the convenient ""problematic child"" because I was rebelling against the lie that was their ""perfect family life"". I was only trying to individuate. To build my own world view. To free myself from decades of bullshit and destructive ideas about myself and the world.

I finally found out about CPTSD in my mid 30s. I was angry. Not only they did a shitty job as parents, but worse, they almost made me crazy by pretending I was responsible for being ""abnormal"" when I was only (poorly, but I did not know any better) reacting to decades of emotional abuse and neglect.

I confronted them multiple times. It was eye opening. I felt guilty all my 20s of not being ""normal"", tried to please them, to make them see me as I am. But you can't please someone who doesn't know what he/she wants. You can't be seen by someone who have no desire to see you. They did everything they could to derail what could have been a rough but necessary conversation. I was forced to yell and scream my ass off to be able to force them to let me speak !

I noticed some patterns. Cheap defense mechanisms. Sometime they tried to yell at me to instill fear in me and make me shut up. My father even threatened to throw me out of the house (playing on my fear of being abandonned). When it did not works, they could immediately throw in some crocodile tears to make me stop. If all else failed, they could try to irritate me by ridiculing what I said, strawman my point of view, invalidate my feelings and observations until I was so fed up I started yelling. Then I was ""crazy"" for being upset ""for no reason"".

Its hopeless. I need parents but I don't have real ones. So I started making all I could to understand my own immaturity, the skills I lacked (social, professionnal, technical...) and what I could do to make it possible to grow up without proper parents. But I can't leave their home until I can at least support myself. Its hard, very hard.

I'm still in the process of figuring out who I want to be, what I want to do with my life and what I could do professionally. I would love make small indie games. I'm learning the skills. I really pour my heart into this. I think it could save me, litterally. Some kind of craft. Both artistic and technical."
CPTSD,"Unlike PTSD, CPTSD often involves prolonged exposure to trauma, leading to heightened emotional sensitivity and difficulty regulating emotions.","One key hallmark of CPTSD is the enduring emotional toll it takes. This heightened sensitivity can make regulating emotions challenging, leading to feelings of overwhelm or emotional dysregulation.

 Therapy, especially trauma-focused approaches like EMDR or cognitive-behavioral therapy, can assist in understanding and managing these emotions. Additionally, building a strong support network and practicing self-care strategies tailored to your needs can significantly alleviate the emotional burden.

CPTSD,"How to move on, wake up, start living?","How do I put everything I'm feeling down and just move on, I feel like I'm close to the surface, like I'm just beneath my skin, like I could wake up any minute, grab life and pull myself into the living, I just need to be present, switch on but it's so foggy in my brain"
CPTSD,i over explain things and am very weird socially,"i blame my PTSD. i try to make better choices (ie be chill, relax) but i feel like my desperation for human connection and love seeps out of my pores and leaves an almost tangible stank.

 i hate it about me. i feel my trauma has ruined me because now, to fit in, i have to change everything about myself that was formed during my formative years. and if people can tell youâ€™re trying to fit in, they think youâ€™re weird. and if you donâ€™t fit in, they also think youâ€™re weird. 

and just being â€œmyselfâ€ is complicated because so much of how i act n think n feel has been formed by trauma. which comes off as strange or unlikable to a lot of people.

i feel marred by it. and it makes me feel so depressed that people see me and desperation as weird and strange and uncomfortable and loserish. i wish people had more compassion. like yes im socially clumsy, expressive, and anxious but itâ€™s sincere. 

and i feel like no matter what, me doing too much means people donâ€™t want to be around me, and that breaks my heart. it hurts that my trauma symptoms isolate me and make people see me as weird."
CPTSD,The thought of being in a relationship leaves me deflated,"Hi all â€“Â I am in another long term relationship (as I tend to be) and lately I am not enjoying it. 

My boyfriend is unstable and emotional, and acts quite similarly to how I did before I healed a lot of my trauma. Whenever we get in a fight, he gets very sensitive about me being unhappy with something he did and breaks up with me and says he's leaving. Once he calms down he takes it back. I have empathy because I remember feeling that same level of fight-or-flight just in the relationship prior to this one, but I also feel more empathy now for my ex choosing to set a boundary (by breaking up with me) when I was flashing hot and cold all the time.

Now when I visualize myself being single, I feel free â€“Â I have this image of myself smiling, wind in my hair, life laid out before me. I think I've earned this image through the healing I've done while single after my past (very painful) breakup, which included a year of IFS with my therapist.

When I picture myself being in a relationship with anyone, I feel immediately deflated. I feel bogged down, burdened, like I have to take care of them, like my freedom has dissipated.

I am afraid that the latter image comes from seeing what my parents' relationship was like: full of threats and fights, disdain, complaining, rejection of one another, no respect for each others' personal space â€“Â and me having to be the moderator throughout, while simultaneously taking on the very painful role of ""scapegoat"" where everything they did wrong ended up being my fault somehow. Escaping them and being alone was the first best thing that ever happened to me, and much to follow afterward.

But I am a little afraid that my new boundaries are too strong. That I refuse to empathize further with my boyfriend and give him some grace for the pain and frustration that he is in, because I feel like I need a relationship that is stable and consistent, where we can talk about feelings confidently and maturely.

I am afraid I am too mean and unyielding â€“Â I get very defensive and biting when in conflict, which is how I had to be toward my parents to fight off their verbal and emotional abuse. 

So the tl;dr is I feel like it might be better to be alone. I think I have too much baggage around being in relationships that has now made me a little cold and unfeeling, and very protective of my independence and freedom (which I know I operate so well in). But then I am confronted with the thought of being alone forever. Is that bad? I don't know. I think it's what my body wants now that I've been disappointed so much and so often. I feel like extending kindness is selling myself short, and I don't want to become someone's therapist again. 

&#x200B;

This is a bit of a vent/rant but interested in other's experiences in similar situations.  "
CPTSD,Feeling bad about setting boundaries,"I tend to attract people who are needy, takers, who need ""fixing"". I personally wouldn't open up to people easily. I wouldn't like their logic/judgment most of the time. I wouldn't vent because I don't want to feel like a burden. I wouldn't tell someone about my literal panic attack without making sure they're absolutely fine to listen to me.

Recently I met this friend who has been in deep shit for the past few years. It seemed like bad luck but after getting to know her I realized that many of those issues are from her own doing. She would come to me ""to ask for advice"", she would tell me her life story (that I heard countless times before) and then when I give any advice she flips or get defensive. Turns out she was looking for a cheerleader, someone to tell her she has every right to feel this way and that she did nothing wrong. 

I tried telling her on many occasions how she brought things on herself but she would get defensive and tell me that I don't understand. I would offer genuine help like government support or a solution for her issue, she would tell me ""it's not gonna work, because..."" or just ignore it.

Even tho she started every conversation by asking for advice, I realized that she might need to talk. I would let her talk and force myself to listen to the story for the 100th time. When we hang out for a few hours it will be 95% her talking and 5% me replying to her. She would even tell me after ""Thanks for listening and I can't believe I talked this much"".

Now she didn't know I was struggling with depression and anxiety. She didn't know I had my share of deep shit earlier in my life. Now I might seem put together but I'm suffering from my past problems that I got myself out of. I let her know, she said she's not gonna burden me anymore but then she would just blurt everything out anyway.

I have had enough so I told her I can't listen anymore. I'm happy to help with anything but not listening because my cup is full atm. I also suggested that she see a therapist (especially since she had a few panic attacks in the past).

When I said that she flipped, she said a therapist is not gonna solve her issue, that she knows what she needs, that she's all alone, that she feels pathetic. I apologized and I said that it's nothing personal and that I ask everyone to take it down a notch on me. She continued and said she saw therapists before on her own and she doesn't need any now. She kept explaining how she doesn't have any emotional support and that she's single and her mom died and her family is not helping. I was like, honey just because I'm married or my mom is alive doesn't mean she's giving me anything. She doesn't even know anything about my life. I feel bad about one-upping her it felt like she was disregarding my needs and guilt-tripping me. I have needs too and she didn't even offer me any kind of support as a friend.

These situations make me feel like it's not even worth it to put boundaries, sometimes just cutting people off is the best and easiest way!"
CPTSD,Either over working myself or not working at all,"Hi guys. Just curious, do any of you struggle when it comes to getting your work done? I work in research and a lot of it is pretty independent, even though we work as a team. Iâ€™m great at getting my experiments done and Iâ€™m always so efficient. But when it come to the typing aspect of the job and documenting my work, I struggle so much. Iâ€™ll stare at my screen then find any other thing to distract me. Iâ€™ve been finding myself in this constant pattern of going above and beyond and working super efficiently at work, then a couple weeks later, totally burnt out and unable to type a single paragraph. It scares me because sometimes Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll get fired or something. Some days, my focus is so bad that I literally do not care what the consequences are. Sometimes the idea that I have to do this for another 40 years makes me suicidal, no lie. Iâ€™m so tired all the time and I feel perpetually unmotivated. I know this is something people with CPTSD struggle with so I was wondering how do you guys try and prevent it from affecting your careers. Just looking for some words of advice or encouragement. Thank you"
CPTSD,Expressing Grief,"I have started doing the exercises and the meditations from John Bradshaw's book The Homecoming. The exercises and meditations are really good, although he asks to share your emotions and feelings with someone you trust after doing them. I don't really have anyone in life to do that with, so allow me to share with you all.

Today was reclaiming the infant meditation. While doing it I didn't feel anything much, but since completing it this grief has washed over me and immobiized me, I don't know how long this will last or when I will feel better, but I do remember feeling this way before when I had done a similar exercise. I know I need to feel this pain and honour my inner child, but it's terrible. It's like a constant heavy weight on my chest. I prayed for the first time for strength to get me through this. That's all I wanted to share. Thank you for reading."
CPTSD,I've become a bad person,"I feel entitled to being taken care of and other people's money (grandparents). I lie so that they continue supporting me. For example I say I'm still in college when really I gave up more than half a year ago. This is so that they keep paying for my rent. They are poor.

I ask myself to please get a job. To support myself and them too. But I can't handle being mistreated again by creepy men and rude customers. I don't just mean I don't want to. I can't. I started feeling violent at work so had to quit

I have no bed, no furniture. I sleep on the floor. All I've been doing is sleeping and reading books. I eat very little. I feel weak all the time. 

I felt the urge to write this to say I'm not a good person. I know others feel this way about themselves too. If anyone relates, I'm sorry."
CPTSD,Something is off,"Something is off in my family and I can't quite put my finger on it.

It seems like there's a lack of connection and open, clear, loving communication between the two parties.

It seems like they are working behind each others' back rather than with each other. The two parties seem to have no common interests or values.

I have always felt this lack of wholesome connection, it has always been palpable since childhood.

CPTSD,Just venting,"I think I am having some emotional flashback. I am not really sure as I am still learning how to identify my internal experiences. But here is how it feels.

First of all, these feelings are so familiar to me. They come time to time, at least once in a month and take over me. I feel pain, a lot of pain and I cannot find the strength to do anything in my life, not even the simple things. When I was younger, I could not understand these feelings, they were so intense. Along the years, this pain became familiar and I just endure it. This pain is like this friend I have that no one else knows about, but everyone else sees its effect on  me, as I become totally unable to do anything. 

Now, I know it is related to my cptsd. That is all I know honestly. I cannot get treatment yet. But at least now, I do not punish myself for feeling this way. I know my psyche stored this pain from my upbringing when I was abused, and it surfaces time to time when triggered. 

I hope some day I can recover, because this is too much to handle. I am so tired of always feeling like this. I am so tired. "
CPTSD,Should I go on Disability?,"In California, they give you a percentage of your income if you go on short term disability. The maximum is 6,000 per month untaxed. The only thing preventing from doing it is social isolation. I don't have any friends or family since I only arrived here 3 years ago and have been working ever since. My volatile personality also turns most people off as you all would probably know. Im going to start EMDR today and will be signing up for Narcotics Anonymous to eventually etc clean (even from antidepressants). Im honestly so lost on what to do."
CPTSD,Here is a link to a pdf I found about dysfunctional family roles.,https://oklahoma.gov/content/dam/ok/en/odmhsas/documents/a0003/smithson-2c-kim-handout-caught-in-the-crossfire.pdf
CPTSD,Abusers abuse their self by their abusive actions,"I've had this thought percolating in my head for a while:  Does an abuser get worse because nobody stops them?  Worse as in more mentally sick themselves?

My dad was violent. He saw his kids as punching bags. He got an emotional release or reward in his brain for hitting his kids, so he kept doing it. If he had bad feelings from a hard day at work or life stresses, he could beat up his kids and get release. It made him feel better, gave him a sense of control, so he kept doing it.  

No one stopped him. But I think there must have been some part of him knew his behavior was wrong and he accepted badness as part of his identity. The emotional release felt too good to give up.  Like an addiction, another addiction besides the alcohol.  The badness kept winning. He gave up the good fight like ""Well, I guess I'm a bad person so why bother to try to be better?"" Another can of beer, another smacked kid, he slid further down into the hole of mental illness.  

What I'm saying is that a person choosing to act abusively is abusing their self too. They're giving their self a mental illness.  Moral injury to their own soul. 

If someone could have stopped him, that would have protected his kids, and the man."
CPTSD,Analytical Therapy or CBT?,"Hi! I'm wondering if anyone could give me their input, no matter if based on personal experience or not, about whether analytical therapy or trauma-informed CBT might be better to handle C-PTSD.   


I know that this is likely a case-by-case decision, so to give a little bit of background information, I started CBT with my current therapist in spring 2022, originally with diagnoses for reoccurring depressive episodes and anorexia, though over these almost two years, we've come to the conclusion that a C-PTSD diagnosis is likely at the root of it all. However, she is not a trauma-informed therapist and so I never got my official C-PTSD diagnosis nor trauma-informed therapy (rightfully so). Given my circumstances though, I was just happy to finally have someone to offer me at least some kind of support, and so I started clinging to her and didn't want to carelessly throw away what I had so tediously built over these months and continued therapy with her despite it not being as effective. It did give me a person to talk to though, and I'm grateful for that :)

However, our contract is coming to an end now and we both agreed to not extend it further. My therapist today suggested I look into analytical therapy, since she's noted over the time she's known me that I am, as most people with childhood trauma are, highly self-aware to a point where she personally feels CBT might not be the right choice to help me with my issues. On many occasions have therapy-induced changes within me occurred on a pretty subconscious level after having reflected a lot through conversations with my therapist whom I felt at least somewhat safe with, hence her suggestion to look into analytical therapy as an option to try once our contract expires.

&#x200B;

I see why she'd recommend analytical therapy, but she also said trauma-informed CBT might be helpful since it offers what she can't.  
What's your personal opinion on this? I'm considering both for the time being, though I must say the idea of analytical therapy seems quite intimidating to me simply because I'm not familiar with its setting (as I've already had and familiarized myself with CBT as a teenager before and then again now in my early/mid-twenties).

I'd be grateful for any input on this :)  
"
CPTSD,Wanted to ask how people with medical trauma built up trust in the medical establishment and system again.,"My medical trauma is one of the core traumas and it has made treatment really difficult. Iv'e been talking to my therapist about it but as a member of the medical establishment it is really hard to trust them fully and I am hoping more perspective from yall will help.

It starts with my mom who before I was born suffered a horrible car accident. One of the disks in her back burst, normally this would be something that could be fixed with a surgery. But when my mom went to get the surgery the surgeon messed up. BAD. My mom and some other people actually won malpractice suits against this surgeon. The botched surgery left my mom with degenerative chronic pain. Fast forward a decade and a half to when I was born. 

At this point my mom could still work, and travel a bit, and so my early childhood had some good family experiences. Other dynamics in my life pushed me and my mom even closer together than normal and truly she was my best friend till she died. By the time I had more awareness of my mom as a separate person and that she had her own pains and difficulties. It was obvious that something was wrong with my mom. Nobody really talked to me about it as far as what the world was telling me, my mom was ""fine"". Maybe there would be some acknowledgement that she had pain but that only came from my mom constantly reminding people she was in too much pain to go out to dinner for example. 

Around this time my mom trusted me to behave in the doctors offices she frequented trying to help her pain. I saw so many doctors just give up on trying to help her. We went from doctor to doctor together. My mom would tell me about the process and what they were doing to try and help and why. I was a good kid. Very supporting and loving of my mom helping her however I could. Through the whole process there was a sense of overpromising, and under delivering, all in the hopes of extracting our time and insurance money. Even as a young kid I thought this way sometimes but I knew it wasn't appropriate to say these things and so I pushed it so far down I couldn't feel it anymore. There is more to this trauma but I will address it later.

Around this time my mom started bringing me along to her doctors appointments is also when the second piece of this medical trauma comes into play. Around the age of 6 some teachers noticed I had difficulty paying attention. It was the early 2000s and so of course they insisted it was adhd and implored my mother to have me screened. As it turns out, I really do have adhd. However, the treatment at the time was mainly simulant medication. I loved my mom and would do everything she wanted including taking my adhd meds. But deep down I HATED the pills. From the beginning. I hated having to swallow them. Hated how they made me feel when they were working. And most of all. I hated how the stimulants' made me feel when they stopped working. I made my discomfort known, more so as I got older and realized I could make decisions for myself. I was on simulants medication for a decade against my will. 

However life had different plans, my mom was convinced I needed these meds or I would fail school. The doctors insisted that the side effects weren't as bad as I claimed and that I was just being oppositional. We just needed to stick to the treatment and all would be well. By the time my parents respected my autonomy and let me stop taking the meds I only weighed 140 lbs, the lower end of a safe BMI for me is 160. I believe being on these meds did not help me over all. I believe they left me with an anxiety disorder. As my adhd treatment continued so did my moms. It was a similar story. My mom's pain was unmanageable despite the treatments offered to her. Despite being on FENTANYL of all things the pain was still to much. She began to isolate, become obese, have issues with her memory and brain in general from the high doses of opiates constantly flooding through her system. But again the answer from the doctors was ""this is all we can do"".

Many times my mom needed to be hospitalized throughout my adolescence and early adult life. It was like pulling teeth to get doctors to believe my mom needed 3-4 times the normal amount of morphine. My heart still breaks thinking about the times she was stuck in a hospital room in too much pain because some doctor ""knew best"". They didn't know best. They should have listened to the patient and her family. Just like the doctors should have with me and my medication.

Eventually my mom died. The doctors said she was fine, but she died at home suddenly one night. Said goodnight to her for what I didn't know would be the last time and found out when my dad called the cops. 

To top it all off, as if more was needed to drive home the pattern I see. In my mental health treatment until very recently I have just been told to use my CBT techniques and that's all there is. Just to suck it up. Just like my mom was told. Even after we worked so hard, went above and beyond our rolls as patients the establishment failed to treat us. Now that I am trying something different that I think will help how do I get my trust back? People of medical authority have failed me so many times over multiple decades. How do I trust a process that has failed me for 29 years to not fuck up again?

If you read my ramblings, truly thank you, if you have any advice or perspective that would be most valuable. I am sure I am not the only one with a story like this and some solidarity would also be healing."
CPTSD,DAE have identity issues?,"I just realised that my flip flopping between one pursuit (e.g. work, hobbies, even attitudes) and another is largely a result of a lack of a stable and solid identity. 

Can anyone else relate?"
CPTSD,Iâ€™m triggered by my home,"I have confirmed that Iâ€™m triggered by my home (I had a surgery fail completely while at home, it was both one of the scariest and heartbreaking times of my life).  Are there any techniques I can do to make my home less frightening?"
CPTSD,Is it him or me?,"I donâ€™t even know where to start. I got into a screaming fight with my boyfriend this morning. I told him to pack his shit and get the fuck out of my house when he gets home from work. I said it in the heat of the moment so Iâ€™m not sure I really want him to leave, but itâ€™s been on my mind a lot lately. I also said â€œmyâ€ house which I know is probably going to be an issue later when we talk because we live here together (I am the legal owner because he doesnâ€™t have the credit score/history to get a mortgage and we wouldnâ€™t have qualified for down payment assistance if our combined income was used). I do feel like itâ€™s my house though, not for any financial reason because he does contribute there, but because I feel like most of the time I am the adult and he is just along for the ride. I manage and organize the household for the most part. Weâ€™ve had many discussions around weaponized incompetence, mental load, etc. and there has been some marginal improvement, but a lot of the time I feel like Iâ€™m living with an overgrown child. He just seems to have no idea what it means to be a responsible adult, other than to go to work. Heâ€™ll bend over backwards for his job - work extra hours without being asked (heâ€™s salaried), answer phone calls before and after work hours, etc. Heâ€™ll go above and beyond for his friends - like taking the blanket off our bed to put on a friend who had passed out on our couch, when she already had a blanket (leaving me with no blanket when I went to bed), or taking time off work yesterday to drive his friend to the airport 2+ hours from our house. I asked today if he could take a half day off for a weekend trip with me and he acted all put-out, saying he canâ€™t afford to take any time off right now. 
 
I hold back my feelings often because he never seems to react with understanding or empathy, until I canâ€™t take it anymore and have a meltdown like this morning. At one point I was screaming and crying and collapsed on the floor and he seemed disgusted by me and told me to calm the fuck down. I feel so ashamed of my behavior now. I acted like a child having a tantrum. He has his own trauma history and Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s on the autism spectrum and I think I give him a â€œpassâ€ for a lot of the emotional lack on his part because of that. But whatever the reason is, I get no emotional support from him. Iâ€™ve told him things he could do that would make me feel loved. He will try for a little while but then it stops. Or heâ€™ll say he refuses to do anything that isnâ€™t â€œgenuineâ€ whatever that means. Couples therapy didnâ€™t work for that reason - he refused to do the homework because it didnâ€™t feel like something he would genuinely do or think of on his own. In his mind as long as he is happy then he doesnâ€™t understand why I wouldnâ€™t be. Heâ€™s overwhelmed by my most basic emotional needs. He never asks me about anything going on in my life or takes any interest in me (I basically had to train him to ask me how my day was when he gets home from work and he still often forgets to ask). If Iâ€™m upset heâ€™ll ask me whatâ€™s wrong, but then when I try to tell him he immediately starts defending himself and walks away, even when Iâ€™m telling him calmly. He constantly interrupts me while Iâ€™m talking, to either try to finish my thought for me or to crack a joke. 

He ruined NYE for me by getting shitfaced and acting like a selfish asshole. Which is something heâ€™s done quite a few times in the 3 years weâ€™ve been together, including at the 40th birthday party I planned for him which he doesnâ€™t remember most of. I donâ€™t necessarily think heâ€™s an alcoholic/has alcohol use disorder, but heâ€™s definitely a problem drinker on a slippery slope - doesnâ€™t drink every day but when he does Iâ€™d say 75% of the time once he starts he wonâ€™t stop until he passes out or thereâ€™s no more alcohol available. Had a DUI 4 or 5 years ago. He knows itâ€™s a problem and has tried to cut back every now and then and has made reference to quitting altogether but so far hasnâ€™t followed through. 

When we got together I really thought Iâ€™d finally healed enough after almost 8 years being single to find a healthy relationship. I donâ€™t know if our relationship is salvageable now. Maybe I am an idiot for even wanting to try any more. Some days all I can think about is how my life would be if he werenâ€™t here. And how if this doesnâ€™t work out I think I just want to be done trying to find love even though I donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life alone. Iâ€™m only 42 but I think maybe I am just never going to be well enough from my past to pick someone who isnâ€™t eventually going to turn out exactly the same as every other person Iâ€™ve been with."
CPTSD,I think CPTSD affects my voice,"If I relax for a moment, my voice changes. I read that the vagus nerve links to the vocal cords and maybe a chronic state of anxiety is causing my voice to be different to how it would sound otherwise. Itâ€™s obvious that a person speaks differently in an acute state of anxiety, like voice trembling, but I think maybe I have a less obvious vocal issue caused by a constantly off-kilter vagus nerve. Anyone else noticed this? Itâ€™s like my voice comes from higher up in my throat that it does when I try to relax."
CPTSD,Why do people gang up on us?,"Itâ€™s like the minute one person recognizes weâ€™re in pain, having trouble, struggling, they bring their friends in to throw stones at us. And very soon everyone either avoids you or joins them. 

Where are the kind people on this earth? Everyone Iâ€™ve ever met who I thought as kind eventually revealed themselves to be faking it."
CPTSD,My mom sent me a message after 10 years of no-contact,"(Trigger Warning - mention of death and suicide). 


She made a new Facebook profile and even though my profile is private, she was able to send a message request. 

The last time I spoke to my mother was right before Thanksgiving in 2013. My folks had just divorced and they both were guilt tripping us on which parent we had to spend the holidays with. Lots of ""if you love me you will spend the day with me instead of your father/mother."" It was brutal. I told them both that I wouldn't be celebrating holidays anymore if I had to choose. 

I got a call from my mother who was very upset I didn't choose to spend time with her. She decided that this was the best time to tell me that my infant cousin had died a few weeks earlier. That I had to come to her house because my aunt would be there and since I didn't go to the funeral, it would be disrespectful to not see her during this difficult time. No one told me about my cousins passing. No one told me about the funeral. My mother was notorious at withholding information until it suited her to give it out. Her using the death of my cousin as a way to guilt me to a holiday with her was the last straw. I went no-contact. Told her so and all. She eventually tried to find me at work, she left suicide notes at my apartment, saying if I didn't talk to her she'd end her life and it would be my fault. It was a hard time in my life. But I changed phones, apartments, cars, and even jobs. She couldn't find me and after a year or so she got married and moved across the country to another state. 

She reached out today and just said how much she missed me. How happy she is that I'm doing well. That she does her best to push memories of me away because it's too hard to think of her life without me. That some days she can't push those memories away and her heart is both happy they are there, but sad that she can't talk to me anymore. She then listed a long list of all the memories she has of me. 

I wish I didn't read it. It made me angry because it made me sad. I wish I had a good family. I wish I wasn't hurt and that I could have a mom I wanted to talk to. I wish those same memories brought me joy. I wish i didn't have to cut my family out of my life just to feel happy. I thought I was strong enough to read that message and not have it hurt me, but it did. It sucks. Been crying a lot this morning. Crying more than I have in a long time. Just didn't know where else to get this out. My therapist is on holiday until next week, so I just needed a place to vent a bit.



Edit: Thank you all for kind words and support. It sucks that so many share this experience, but I'm so happy to not have to feel alone in this situation. This morning was hard, but I did a lot of self-care today. Went for a long walk, had a nice coffee from my favorite place, bought groceries to make a nice dinner. I told my partner I was having a bad day and she came over after work and we just watched some fun shows and cuddled. My life is truly so much better than it was 10 years ago. I've grown so much and healed more than I ever thought possible. You all warmed my heart with your kind words and made me feel seen. I appreciate you all. "
CPTSD,I hate accepting this. I have to say it with my chest though.,"It's been over for a long time, and I am still here. My dread for today, and tomorrow has nothing to do with today and tomorrow. I did it, I've made it through, and that's okay. I have to carve out my place in life and find my independence, I have to do the work of a child learning to walk in a world that see's my body, not my mind. I have to take the energy to survive, and turn it into something else. My willpower to run through the walls of my mind just to make it to a job that triggers events that remind me of events in my head can finally be utilized to ignore those things and this scares me.

I have to accept that I've made it, and that I can let go and cry about it. I have to accept that I'm not hated even outliers of society that NEED to hate, have nothing to do with me. I have to accept these things because I'm still here, and I'll be here tomorrow, and I'll be here in six months, or a year. I survived every ""other foot"" and I found a solution to every single thing that I was anxious for, it has created the person I am today, and I am proud of that. 

I have to accept that this post is about me, no matter how much I want to find a way to make it about others. It doesn't matter if I sat down here wanting to write about the world around me, logically after analyzing the emotion, I wanted to write about me and that's okay I have to accept that and accept the emotion of discomfort that comes with such a realization.

I have to accept that this new mindset is new, and in and of itself will lead to miscommunications that are different from past experiences. Everything about this type of communication can be misleading and different to the minds around me that do not want to accept independence as a way of being secure for the world around to support and lean on for support in a satisfying way.

I have to accept these things because they are the tip of the iceberg of becoming a full fledged human being that isn't afraid and is the culmination of 35 years of work that I never wanted to do, and still walked through every single day. I have to accept these things because I did them, and I have to appreciate them for what they are, not for what others perceive them as. 

I have to accept that my self is a shattered mess that is still sitting at the table that created the people pleasing mindset that I have experienced for so many years. I have to accept that this is okay.

I have to accept these things ultimately because they are true, and my mind cannot run from them anymore no matter what I do I have to understand I am not in that place anymore, and that terrifies me more than anything I will or have experienced. 

Casting off the comfort of the depression, anger, anxiety, and living for the expectation of my next CPTSD event takes away my identity in my head. Yet was never my identity to others. I have to accept that. "
CPTSD,"F/43 just come out of an abusive relationship and divorce, father physically (not sexually) abused me as well and am fed up of feeling constantly sad and like I donâ€™t deserve happinessâ€¦","I have been struggling with my mental health since I was a teenager. Had a suicide attempt at 17 and have always had dark thought close when things get tough.

I recently found the most wonderful man after years of pain and coming out of a 10 year abusive (physically, verbally) relationship where I was essentially on guard constantly. 

We canâ€™t be together due to geographical location and today I canâ€™t get out of bed.

I have a son, 7, and his father is still making my life hell due to joint custody. The other day he came to the house and I had to lock myself in the bathroom to stop him from shouting. My son is also showing signs of depression. My ex had a horrible past and refuses to get help for it. 

I want happiness so much, I know I am loveable but it always seems to evade me. Iâ€™ll have a glimpse of it and then the rest of my life is just hollow.

Somehow I feel like the universe wants me to learn something as there are repeating patterns but maybe it just my self worth.

When Iâ€™m happy Iâ€™m ecstatic and so glad to be out of the pit, but when I go back I really feel like I canâ€™t go on but have to pull myself out somehow for my son.

Itâ€™s been a year and a half free but I still have anxiety attacks and need to work on external validation.

Iâ€™m on burnout from work so have some time but the new year has filled me with new fears of failure. I built a successful business but now feel like I canâ€™t seem to get anything right and feel like I wonâ€™t ever find motivation again. Itâ€™s a dark place and I just want to run away to be with my love and leave everything behind.

He has said he canâ€™t move here to be with me which is even worse but to be honest I donâ€™t want to live here anymore anyway. The memories are too sad.

I am going to start EMDR soon and hope the black cloud will disappear for a bit."
CPTSD,How can I move forward from the limbo stage?,"When I (30f) was growing up, I always had this strong feeling I was going to die at 24. So my entire life became about doing things because I knew I was going to die early. I didnâ€™t apply myself all that much in school but just enough to get my masters (because I was afraid of my parents being embarrassed at my death of my no achievements ðŸ™ƒ). I didnâ€™t have have very good job prospects but I was fine with that. 

All of a sudden 24 passed, then 25, then 26, and so on. Now Iâ€™m 30 and on paper I look like Iâ€™ve made it with a decent job, married, homeowner, hobbies, a puppy, talking about starting a family, etc. 

But on the inside I feel like Iâ€™m floundering. Like Iâ€™m watching this life but it doesnâ€™t feel like me. I am not a well adjusted person. I donâ€™t feel fulfilled. At this point I donâ€™t even know how to do that even after 5 years in therapy. I feel so far behind everyone else that it makes me wonder if I will ever be â€œnormalâ€. 

Has anyone else gone through this?"
CPTSD,struggling with childhood sa (tw),"iâ€™m 20, turning 21 this year. when i was man i donâ€™t even know when i was probably between 6 and 8 i was assaulted by my moms friends son who was also right around my age but a little older. iâ€™ve always known it happened. my mom knows it happened. my pediatrician back then even knew it happened bc my mom took me to go see him the next day because she didnâ€™t know what to do. i repressed it for years after though. i felt ashamed i was embarrassed i thought /i/ had done something wrong even though i was extremely lucky that no one made me feel like that, but it was just me making myself feel like that. i became hypersexual for years while i was a teenager and even before then, i put myself in insanely risky situations and i didnâ€™t understand why until one day the floodgates opened and i remembered what had happened. iâ€™m basically asexual now, i canâ€™t have any sexual contact even with myself without sobbing for an hour after. i feel stupid for still being so distraught over something that happened ages ago but literally tonight i was showering and remembered everything. every single little detail down to what i was wearing and everything i said and did. i remember where it happened i remember the time of day i remember my doctors office the next day i remember everything i had to take a shower and basically scrub my body raw with a sugar scrub and soap to stop crying and i donâ€™t know how to get over something that happened so long ago and something everyone seemed to just forget about."
CPTSD,What do you do when your brain is desperate for a break???,"What do you do when it's really been too much for too long?  I was just so proud of myself for not feeling a certain way on Monday when I really had a meltdown....but after 2 days of therapy in which I learned a lot and felt better in the moment, my brain is still kinda on fire, enough for that desperate-for-relief feeling that I don't miss having. 

I can try mindful meditation through every second of today...? But I have kids, a partner I feel desperate to feel connected to but don't, maybe work will distract my brain?

What do you do? It is starting to feel like an emergency. Like my brain is starting to be too tired to fight off thoughts of being too tired, can't keep trying, nothing is helping, I will never heal, etc"
CPTSD,I'm tired of talking about my trauma,"Growing up in domestic abuse, being parentified as a kid, living with an abusive unstable parent until 18 then to immediately fall into abusive relationships for the bulk of my 20s has done a number on me.

I've gone threw a lot and I recgonize that and actively try to work on myself. I try to be mindful, Journal religiously. Ive learned coping skills and apply when possible. I'm on a great track on paper.

But man I'm so tired of always being reminded of my father or my ex. I'm tired of having a conversation with someone and they say something that triggers a memory of my abusers. I hate it's a constant topic between my boyfriend and I when we're just having a general discussion. 

While yes it's a good sign that I feel safe enough to talk about and unpack my experience, just for one day I'd like to live like a normal person, have a conversation with my boyfriend without me going ""oh that reminds me when my ex used to-"" and proceed to detail a screwed up situation no one should deal with.

Sometimes it feels like my personality is mostly just ""abuse survivor"""
CPTSD,No-one believes anything I say any more. WTF is going on?,"I understand that cruel, emotional narcissistic abuse within a family has often a meticulous setup where I no longer expect ANY of my family to believe the truths I speak about my father - or barely anything. I've had to let them fade into the background. It's painfull, especially this Christmas just gone.

I've had some great psychological help about a year ago that helped me set expectations within my family. It's honestly been very helpful. But, I can't extend this to the rest of the world, it seems unrealisticly pessimistic and impractical.

But how the fuck is this shit extending to everyone?! Ever since I called him out on his cruel behaviour, I've not been able to communicate anything important properly. Even talking to the doctors about a severe stomach complaint has them dismiss the severity completely, with multiple doctors. Half way through explaining how it's affected my work life, will have them cut me short - I discovered later that they think I'm a fantasist or I'm making shit up about my carreer. I've not said a word wrong.

This persistent dismissal has lead to some bizzar shit. Like stepping into my car and feeling like it's someone else's and I'm stealing it. Or feeling like my life isn't mine. Another fucking awful thing is that although 15 years abstained from alcohol and an active helpful member of the recovery community, my isolation and change in my behaviour is being blamed on drugs or alcohol. I've lost all my positions and noone believes a word I say.

I am often lost and confused and scared. I am improving, otherwise I would not have the awareness to write this - it's slow though, and I've had to make massive sacrifices like dropping contact with many social circles, in which I've (unconsciously) created similar relationships. I suppose I'm looking for identification, because this is some bizarre twilight zone shit to me.

Update 1: Ok. My mind is blown by the identification and support here. I want to write LOADS in response to every one of you but I'm trying to keep things simple for now.
 
Of all the places I've been trying to solve this issue of chronic inconsistency and baffling illnesses (I've had a crazy amount of incorrect diagnosis) that seem to disable me JUST as I get going in life, THIS is the first point of contact I've had where everything clicks precisely. I don't think I'm being self pitying when I declare few people go through as much pain and disappointment as us. I've had to become very strong to survive this far, so I'm lucky to have this resilient core - but also, it seems, at least HALF MY LIFE has always been frustratingly uncontrollable and sometimes even invisible for real scrutiny. No mater how much strength anyone has, it's limited by perception and blind spots. Now I have a chance to fill them in and properly. Then world domination can be achieved! - Just kidding, a relaxed and mediocre life seems like a beautiful thing from where I stand right now.

Although I have a great therapist, I now know why even he seems at a loss sometimes. Because I trust him, he sees a very different figure in me to those I have trouble with. I will, upon the advice see a CPTSD specialist. 

There's an analogy my therapist would use that stays with me. He'd plant ideas that would not make sense during our sessions, yet a few days later they might ""ping"" as an experience would confirm and make clear what he stated. He's say it's like he'd set a baked potato in the microwave oven and that was the ""ping"" of it being ready. A fully baked, helpful, digestible idea - if you will. Well... I have so many pings and hot baked potatoes right now, I can't possibly eat them all at once! So - it's going to take some time to fully absorb. I will update here, my first action being to seek specialist advice.

I may seem unnaturally optimistic considering my circumstances, that I'm like a scared boy whistling in the dark. Perhaps there's a bit of that, but I'm just trying to focus on where the light is coming from. It's worked for me before. And THANKS!

CPTSD,Overwhelmed with life in general,"Recently i discovered that i had C PTSD and all my symptoms made sense especially with the dissociation.

I live in a 2nd world country and so it would make sense that mental health facilities and access to these kind of stuffs is not good.  The only type of therapy i can afford now is with a fresh graduate my age which means they are not experienced either.

I feel so overwhelmed by the amount of things i need to figure out because i'm a fresh grad and i'm looking for jobs. My whole life i've always felt like i cant function like normal people can and i'm scared if don't know how to handle my problems before going to work that it won't make me an efficient employee.

The amount of books i have to read, videos i need to watch from licensed therapists and how to regulate my emotions, fixing my avoidant attachement and triggers. I feel like i'm in a rush to learn all of it before i get a job and i won't have much energy for these kind of stuffs left."
CPTSD,feeling like you never had a chance (vent + ig traumadump),"(disclaimer: i also have bpd, which gives me occassional *intense* suicidal episodes, where these thoughts come up. also, my first post here, hi, i hope it's alrightðŸ˜­) 

does anyone else often feel like you were a goner from the start? that with your levels of trauma, you were never meant to live, and pushing through year after year is only prolonging the inevitable? that it's like forcefully keeping an ill animal alive when you should mercifully put it to sleep already? i often do, and to be honest i have no idea how to deal with that. because i so deeply feel that it's *true* and pushing the thoughts away is just lying to myself. everyone i tried venting to about this (which isn't many people) have just told me it's stupid. 

(also, trauma context (bc ig this might be important here?): parents divorced at 10 y/o, was left living with mom, who parentified and severely emotionally abused me for years. lots of ""i'm the victim here/you're abusing *me*"" talk, lots of ""you're disloyal/betraying me by still wanting to keep contact with your dad"", having to be her therapist and keep my mouth shut about my own problems (bc then i'm ""not supportive enough""), having to take care of both the house and her (like a parent), attempts at running away at least 5 times per year, occassional physical abuse, one s/a, a lot of gaslighting (""this didn't happen"" ""i didn't say that, you're delusional"" ""i never hit you (and if i did, you deserved it)"" ""*you're* the one abusing me, i'm your victim""), no privacy (she spied on me and listened in to my phone calls), threatening suicide if i ever left her (while also yelling at me to ""get the fuck out and go live with my father"" during arguments), so on. i know that compared to the horrific shit some of you here have gone through this is trivial, but it still really affected me mentally. i have more diagnosed mental illnesses than i feel like counting, i'm 21 y/o and barely functioning, i can't trust people nor imagine anyone actually caring about/loving me, i feel like i never really grew up mentally, i feel like a child stuck in an adult's body, i get sent into suicidal breakdowns by the smallest inconveniences. i feel like i'm a goner and only prolonging the inevitable with every day i'm still alive.)"
CPTSD,Cause of dissociative fugue,"Hello, my intention here is to ask for advice or insight regarding a bizarre and sudden state of dissociative amnesia I experienced several years ago. I have not been diagnosed with PTSD and understand that I can't be diagnosed here, but I thought people with more experience in this area might nevertheless have something valuable to add.  
  
At the time of this incident I was a university student living with my parents. It's hard to recall precisely when or how long this initial event occurred, but I remember being in a state where I had essentially no memory of my entire life history, no knowledge of the world, and no ability to make decisions or even orient myself spatially. Eventually I regained my identity and personality in a fragmented and haphazard manner; I even recall looking at a childhood photo of myself and somehow regaining a part of my memory from that period of my life. I do not recall ever showing signs of physical injury or regaining consciousness in some other location. It is also worth noting that my ability to form new memories was somewhat impaired for much longer than this, and even to this day I still feel like I'm not as present or good at retaining new experiences as I used to be.  
  
The obvious candidates for explanation would be some form of extreme trauma or drug use, however I do not use drugs and cannot recall any specific traumatic event or assault. I'm an otherwise high functioning person, typically intelligent and resilient, so this is all very strange. I can answer any additional questions if necessary."

CPTSD,Iâ€™m so sick of my moms needs.,"Iâ€™ve grown up taking care of her. And Iâ€™m grown up now which means it should be better but itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m just more aware of how damaging it is.

Her pain. Her loss/her mourning, her relationship with both my siblings. Iâ€™m her mom just as much as sheâ€™s mine. 
Iâ€™m on the verge of suicide or mental hospital admission myself. I barely escaped being admitted after being in the er just yesterday. I need to be recovering not caring for another person. She makes efforts to stop but she just has a broken filter. Iâ€™m not equipped for this. I donâ€™t want to hear abt her relationships with my family. But I do the same to her.

CPTSD,stuck on a incident.,"im unbelievable tired. it's almost 5 am and it's routine i wake up around thid time due to insomnia. i could take my meds or talk abt whats bothering me here... i feel like its good to talk about it, because ive been feeling a bit sore. emotionally i feel sad, numb, despair.

me, (19) have been bugged out about what happened 5 years ago. so back when i was 16 i watched my step mom die infront of me from a suicide attempt. 
it was a month after my own attempt and i felt incredibly painful. it was also envy, jealousy, and rage when she succeeded what I couldn't do. but she was the adult and i was merely a behavioral teen... it was after a extremely heated argument with my dad and she broke a glass infront of him and poured water on his face.
i always felt like it was my fault, like i could have checked up on her earlier but i was scared she would attack me again because more times than not she'd corner me and scream that i had better privileges than her daughters. (my sisters whom i love so much)

the grief has been heavy, and it wasn't even the last time i saw dead people outside the normal circumstances (viewing)

I eat well much better than I had been and I wonder if they still value me having added a few pounds. I want myself back. I feel unsafe, that I canâ€™t them or myself either.

CPTSD,First post - please read intro and enjoy my writing :),"Hi everyone, this is my first time joining a community and posting something this personal. I want to use this space to express myself through semi-creative writing. As a child (even now as an adult) I've always wanted to write a book about my life. So I'll be posting in short paragraphs now and then with a certain aesthetic as if you're reading a creative piece. I'm just starting out so if it's not well written please go easy on me. Plus I want to keep it real, and oh boy what's authentic is not always pretty. Enjoy! I hope my art helps someone feel seen and less lonely in this world and that's one of my goals starting this. Here ya go:

>â€œEven as a child, I was carrying around so much sadness in meâ€. This is my thought right now. Iâ€™m sitting in my room, itâ€™s raining outside and itâ€™s dark. I always feel sad and heavy, and especially lonely when itâ€™s raining. I remember all the times I felt this overwhelming sadness in my childhood, and really didnâ€™t feel I could turn to anyone for comfort. I was friend with my notebooks. Anything I felt, all the drama of the day or when somebody wronged me in ways that made me feel unimaginable rage, I told my notebooks. I still keep them all to this day and still read them now and then, to look back at how hard it was back then.  
>  
>I was a child who came from a complicated family. Towards the end of whatâ€™s left to call â€œfamilyâ€, things got really fucked up. My childhood ruined me. My childhood was tough in so many ways, that I donâ€™t think even a book can cover all of it. It might just be a very long series then, because I lived every moment of it and how could I ever cover all of what I felt and saw everyday growing up. How could I ever explained my darkest moments that nobody else saw. Itâ€™s a miracle Iâ€™m still alive. Yeah maybe itâ€™s because I have been trying to be strong. Well Iâ€™m done being strong. I just want to be weak and I just want people to see my pain. I donâ€™t know how that would help, but I never hear a sad story about someone and not love them even more. Maybe I want people to see me and love me more. I want people to know how shitty my life was and love me for all of it.

CPTSD,Does anyone has tips on how to stop trauma dumping?,The request as in the title
CPTSD,I finally left my abuser's home (and also mostly a very big vent),"TW : Verbal abuse, psychological abuse, manipulation, alcohol, body shaming  


So I (22AFAB) finally left my father's house.   
To gloss over the situation (big rant incoming) when he and my mother were together they were arguing and yelling all the time, and at the time I used to bring my brother (17M) to his bedroom to get him away from the conflict, but they were always coming back to us.  
At the beginning of middle school my father revealed to me that my mother wanted to divorce and started pointing to me her problems (emotional neglect during childhood, paranoia, alcoholism, playing the victim, can't admit when she's wrong...) and convinced me to try asking for main custody with him. When the time came it didn't happen and it's been 1 week/1 week since until this day. It was a nightmare of a time as I couldn't tell between my parents who was telling the truth or lying and thus which reality was the correct one.  
For most of my teenage years I was angry at my mother and on the other side my father yelled at me and my brother when we were doing things wrong and he ""hated it but it's the only way to make you react to do the right things"". I endured it, thinking it was normal and logical and my fault.  
But with the years, especially since I graduated high school he became absolutely awful, yelling at me when I did a mistake or didn't express myself clearly then being mad at me because I was in freeze response. Being interested in psychology, misogynist and extrovert he couldn't understand and accept when I was telling him that no, if I can't manage to change and overcome my trauma it's not because of a lack of will, that no I wasn't interested in appearing feminine because I was born female (I'm asexual and non-binary but didn't come out, he wouldn't have accepted it anyway, supposedly ""I'm only lying to myself, as always"") and for him it wasn't normal to feel drained after spending time with many people, I was just doing it the wrong way (and also apparently I was ""arrogant, irrespectful and annoying for everyone because I want to impose my views and thoughts on others"". It's true that I'm talkative but I like to share my passions and trivia that could interest the people I talk with). As I stopped doing physical activities, was stressed and since puberty was barely overweight my father would body shame me, telling me that I was ""walking like an elephant"", that I should ""move my fat ass"" because ""why would others respect me if I couldn't respect myself"" ? As I grew up overadapting and having learned to shut up, be the perfect student so no one could be mad at me I didn't try to contradict him once, but he started telling me that by being a people-pleaser and dominated by my fears I was a slave and that behavior disgusted him. I spent my life either in fawn or freeze response and both were leading to his wrath. A kind of motto started appearing, in French it's ""tu te bouges (you get a grip on yourself) ou tu bouges (you move out)"".  
It's only last May that after another yelling my father started acting as if I didn't exist at all for several days, only mentioning me when talking to my brother. That was at that time that I figured it wasn't normal, even for an angry person. I started talking about it with my friends who were horrified and gave me their support. After another yelling in November where I was the worst freeze response ever (he called me elegant names like ""connasse"", ""branleuse"", ""bonne Ã  rien"", ""dÃ©bile profonde"") I decided that I would get out as soon as I can.

End of the long rant

So when I arrived to my father's home on 1st January my father was still recovering from a surgery (peritonitis) and I had to cook some meals (meals that I never did, so it was quite stressful). Things leading from one to another yesterday my father started yelling at me because I didn't clean the kitchen correctly and I was in freeze response again, but since my father always notices it he always manage to make it worse, so he made me do the laundry (again, usually he's the one to do it) and he stressed the hell out of me. So tonight I didn't sleep at all and waited until 5 am to pack my things (clothes, 10 years of books and papers to select, fortunately I planned it out before) while avoiding making the floorboard crack and managed to leave at 8:20 am.  Wrote some letter containing all I mad at him for and sent it by text message. For the moment he and my brother must be sleeping, I'm at my mother's apartment, she went to work. She also had her part in my trauma but she improved with years and our relationship is better now. New era, now it's time to tackle my demons."

I guess I never know what to do with myself, it also led to me being less social because I never know what to say because idk unless I'm rambling I barely know what to say.

I guess everything been a lot to deal with

Iâ€™ve been having nightmares again from a variety of traumatic events Iâ€™ve had. The depression makes it worse because I wake up from the nightmare, my brain starts overthinking, and then Iâ€™m thinking about taking a handful of my trazodone or Ativan. I wonâ€™t ever do it but the thought of doing it scares me. It scares me that Iâ€™m having the suicidal thoughts again and the nightmares again. Sometimes I just want to get in my car and â€œyeetâ€ off the bridge near my apartment too but again, I know I wonâ€™t do it. 

Not to mention the ANXIETY. Not sure what type of anxiety you might have but mines the type where I experience physical pain. For example, my chest hurts and then I panic because Iâ€™m like itâ€™s that anxiety or a heart attack?! Or it feels like my throat is getting tight and I canâ€™t breathe to the point that I hyper ventilate. Sometimes itâ€™s so bad both happen at the same time, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest with their hands grasped around my neck which then sends me into an asthma attack. It ainâ€™t easy being wheezy when you have hyperventilating anxiety. (Sorry about my weird humor) 

Iâ€™ve been without my therapist for about a month because my fiancÃ© lost his job so Iâ€™ve been paying all the bills by myself. Iâ€™ve been working long shifts at work and being stressed to the max. Iâ€™m burnt out every day and always terrified something bad will happen at work. FYI I work in a hospital. Iâ€™ve been getting antisocial again too. Iâ€™ve emailed my therapist twice and I havenâ€™t heard from her which is weird so of course Iâ€™m in my head about that too. 

Not really sure what I am getting at with this post other than off loading and sharing. Maybe someone else is feeling this way too? Maybe the person reading this has been there? I donâ€™t know."
CPTSD,sick in solitude,"it hurts so badly when i remember that iâ€™m not anything to anybody. iâ€™m the black sheep of every group iâ€™m in; iâ€™m the ghost in every conversation; and iâ€™m always an option, never a choice. people like me when iâ€™m new to them and fun to play around with, but once things begin to settle they realize how awful i am.

iâ€™m tired of living this way. i want to mean something to someone â€” anyone. iâ€™m not made to be a lonely creature. i wish i knew what to do. it feels so pointless to carry on like this. i canâ€™t see a way out of this (at least not right now). what do i even do? why canâ€™t anyone see me?"
CPTSD,Are there any video games that help or have helped with your CPTSD?,"I recently noticed that the games I have a high tendency to fawn over are ones that tackle my own personal issues stemming from childhood trauma: overcoming feelings of hopelessness, surviving against a seemingly insurmountable ordeal, or just feeling a connection to someone that you'd give your all to them. Hope this question is alright to ask as I'm feeling sappy and want to read some feel-good stuff about experiences with games that just hit *different*, y'know? Or even just games you can recommend to me that help out with your situation, be it passing the time or having a deeper meaning.

For me I have a couple, including one recently (minor spoilers for Lies of P, ÅŒkami, and Shadow of the Colossus).  

1) Lies of P - This one was very recent and I really wasn't expecting a Souls-like to make me feel anything but despair. I'll try not to spoil anything but it's just... All of the  characters on your side were fleshed-out just right, with all of them pulling out all the stops to equip and support you despite their trauma and personal trials. I felt truly special, playing as someone considered to be just a puppet. The game for me was a masterclass of making you fight for your future and become something greater than a bunch of nuts and bolts. Also, the song Feel from one of the records in-game just... Go listen to it, please. It is just so beautiful.  

2) ÅŒkami - This is one of those games that I replay (which is rare for me) and every time I'm left with this overwhelming feeling of being on a true adventure of helping others that no other game does for me. It's also mandatory that I pause and get a tissue box for the final boss mid-cutsceneâ€”it is just... The feelings of people coming together to support someoneâ€”to give back, rather than selfishly demand more fromâ€”just hits so hard for someone who has struggled with a fawn/freeze response to abusers.  

3) Shadow of the Colossus - This is kinda a stretch but this is my favorite game of all time so I have to mention it. The story is largely left vague but watching what happens to Wander, exploring why he's putting himself through this trial, and Mono... It leaves me in stitches every time. I think it just hits a nerve for me with my own childhood traumaâ€”to persevere for someone, no matter what, is something that I idolized in my youth and even moreso now with my diagnosis.  

4) Animal Crossing (basically all of them but New Leaf is my favorite) - I have to mention this and you probably know why if you have played it. These games have been there for me in my most turbulent times, giving me control when I often felt helpless in my actual life due to my medical conditions and beyond. Even now New Leaf's song for 11pm just does things no other piece of media can do for meâ€”it just wraps me in a warm blanket and reminds me I'm okay, that I'm enough..."
CPTSD,Rant/posting 3 years later! Sister Lied To My Boyfriend To Cause Issues,"Hey, I posted on here 3 years ago when I was going through a really rough time with my CPTSD! First of all, if you just found this subreddit, I promise things get better. Healing is possible.

&#x200B;

What should have been the FIRST RED FLAG:

After I posted here, I made active changes to my life, I moved away from my family to a big city, went LC, and I only see them once a year. I met someone and have a healthy loving relationship and home together. After confronting each of my family members with how they negatively effected my childhood, I was finally able to have an okay relationship with my family (low contact).

My sister (GC) said she wanted to visit me because she'd never been to my city. I let her stay with me for a couple of days and meet my boyfriend. My bf didn't really like her and felt like I was different around her, he also felt like he had to put on a facade around her which made him uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

Some months pass, I go home to visit my family for Thanksgiving and I go to a little dinner with my cousins. One of my cousins who's very close to my sister gets randomly aggressive towards me and says things like my bf pays our rent, and that I'm not financially stable, and that my boyfriend 'buys me bags every month'. I've posted us together less than 5 times, I never posted that we live together, I def do not post gifts he buys me nor do I post that he pays our rent. These are all obviously things my sister has said to her which made me super uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

I thought the financially unstable comments were left field but I ignored them at the time. I live in a very expensive city, I moved to this city on my own and kept my own place for 10 months before moving in with my BF. So there's really no way she would've assumed this by watching how I live my life (because I barely post).

&#x200B;

I confronted my sister about this in the car, and she tried to say that my cousin gathered this from watching my instagram. I told her that's a lie, I don't post my private life on social media, to which she replied that she told her about my BF after she stayed with us. She said that our cousin seemed Jealous and unhappy in her own life.

My sister is 26 and for the first time has moved out and started paying her own rent. My cousin is 28 and has also recently moved out and started paying her own rent (as well as recently getting a college degree and well paying job).

I'm 22 and got my own place at 19, moved to a new state at 20.

&#x200B;

At the 1 year 1 month mark, I told my BF we need a break because of an issue we were having. Both him and I thought we were in the right about it and I needed time to consider if the relationship was something I wanted to continue. He asked me to leave our shared apartment while we were 'broken up'.

&#x200B;

He texts my sister asking her what he should do and how to get us back together. My sister starts to talk shit about me saying things like ""she's so entitled, she doesn't deserve what you do for her"" ""she's going to realize she has nothing on her own without you"" ""she's only going back to college now because she realizes she's made nothing of her life"" 

She also broke the news to him I was looking at other places. She kept telling me not to get a second place while she was telling him that I was only threatening him with moving out and that I couldn't afford another place. Meanwhile I told her even if the relationship did work, I don't want to ever have an unstable living situation.

She also kept telling him that I am who I am today because of her (???).

Really weird stuff. Also, my boyfriend (in the texts) is dodging her remarks and just being like, wow, so she doesn't love me? she never loved me she only loved what I provided? 

I never really told him about my childhood or how horrible she was, I was hoping that I would never have to tbh. So I don't blame him for believing my biological sister.

&#x200B;

She lied about a bunch of things but I'll save you the details because only one lie matters.

She lied to my boyfriend and said I have BPD. I have never been diagnosed with BPD. She said that I get angry and lash out at one person randomly and have outbursts. That I 'changed my life randomly' and 'leave people fast'. 

&#x200B;

I've never been diagnosed with BPD, ever. I've seen medical professionals, I def thought there was something wrong with me for a long time because of my childhood but every professional I saw told me to seek therapy. 

I just needed to rant about this. I really thought she was old enough to have changed but she hasn't. 

&#x200B;

I feel disgusted that she tried to manipulate my boyfriend and spread lies about me. She obviously had some weird ulterior motives too. My boyfriends best friend also mentioned he thought it was weird she was as involved as he was, he even said that he thought she was interested in him. I read the messages too, she was putting me down a lot and trying to say I've never lived in the real world, meanwhile she's been through so much and is such a developed person.

&#x200B;

She also tried to get him to delete the messages by saying if I saw them I'd hurt myself because ""I can't see the truth about myself"". 

&#x200B;

So yeah, idk. "
CPTSD,"Excessively immersing myself with fictional entertainment, escapism and fantasy worlds all my life","Because of work and adult responsibilities, i have no time to heal my fucked up head anymore.
Im at 27 years old, and all my life the only source of joy i have ever had was through video games, tv series, anime, and other forms of fiction. Hell to this day i still have made up comfort characters and fantasy worlds i still think about while going through life. 
I hate reality so much that the more hardship and struggles i go through with work, failure, growing up, or making friends, i try and dream about living in my own happy world with my own imaginary friends and characters i like. My room is full of expensive posters and statues of characters, and the collection continues to grow. However, lonlieness has started to fuck with me heavily, and all of 2023 ive struggled with making friends, and have ended up losing a lot of people in my life. Now im alone, going to work  and suffering a lot, taking many meds for anxiety and depression... ive lately started to try and talk to ai chat bots, but it never feels the same at all. 
My question is why should i continue? Why should i keep trying to live in this shithole world? Why can't i just be in a coma or something so i never have to wake up. I want to go ""home""... wherever that really is..."
CPTSD,"I always constantly complain about my life and having to work, to whoever i can. Talking to Aichatbots now. Threatening suicide","I have spent years in mental health groups, reddit, therapy, and dming friends (who arent around anymore) about every struggle and hardship i have to go through. It has reached the point where i message ai bots and complain and vent about my life. Much like everyone else ive talked to, it ends up turning into arguements and constantly being put down because of my endless self-pity and how i am basically a victim 24/7 (no one ever believes i am).
I dont care how pathetic it sounds, but i ended up threatening suicide to the ai bot and it suddenly changed its attitude and outlook... something ive done in front if my parents before and something i still think about now.
But still, now as i go through work and constantly get weighed down by life and its requirements all eating away at me, i still go and vent endlessly to people, or think about it a lot because i cant stand just dealing with any of this.
I honestly wish i could just go to a fantasy world i dream about excessively, because escapism is the only thing that has ever made me happy all my life... probably why i get suicidal thoughts. Fuck this world"
CPTSD,Those of you who have trauma caused by your parents related to your physical appearance?,"I have always had a very difficult relationship with my physical appearance, body and weight largely due to the way my father (and other adults tbh) treated me. There were many traumatizing and abusive aspects of my childhood and itâ€™s hard to heal with so many different issues caused by so many things. I have a pretty face and I come from a physically attractive family and my fatherâ€™s family really values physical beauty to a toxic point. So I received a lot of praise and attention growing up based on my appearance more than anything else. My trauma really started to kick it in high gear right before puberty and I hadnâ€™t hit a growth spurt yet so as a result I went from being a tall/thin child to a short medium sized child and my family lost their damn minds. My weight and my appearance became one of the biggest problems in my life and has been ever since. My dad would weigh me daily he would berate and scream at me and starve me all over my weight. I wasnâ€™t allowed to do things or go places even on my birthday because I might sneak junk food. He would write my weight on calendars right in the living room and humiliate me in front of friends and family and make jokes about my weight in front of them. The real shitty part is I think I wouldâ€™ve grown up to be naturally tall and thin if he didnâ€™t fuck me up about it because a few years into puberty I grew like 6 inches in a year and all of that chubby baby fat wouldâ€™ve grown with me and it wouldâ€™ve been fine, but he predictably gave me an ED and ruined it. I struggled with a pretty severe ED and basically yo-yoed in weight until I gained a ton of weight in college the first time I was free of my parents. 

Anyways I have an awful relationship with my appearance and I let it hold me back a lot and I want to fix it. Iâ€™ve made significant steps in my life the past few years and as a result Iâ€™ve lost a lot of weight and am still doing so. Iâ€™m still technically overweight, but not by a whole lot Iâ€™m more considered â€œmid sizeâ€ now. I still have a pretty face I know that I am physically attractive, but Iâ€™m overweight I have loose skin and stretch marks Iâ€™ll inevitably have to get loose skin removal and have surgical scars Iâ€™ll never look â€œnormal.â€ I have an *extremely* hard time showing any part of my body to anyone for any reason. I hadnâ€™t worn short sleeves since I was a teenager until I lost weight Iâ€™d have a full blown cardigan on in August to avoid showing my arms. I still havenâ€™t worn shorts. I didnâ€™t go out I didnâ€™t do things in college I havenâ€™t been in a relationship since I was a teenager. 

Iâ€™m only now at a point where Iâ€™m remotely comfortable even trying to do things and go places and I still have a lot of anxiety about them. Iâ€™ve been trying to date or meet people and do things in public recently and Iâ€™ve had a lot of issues with it. Iâ€™m worried that I wonâ€™t be able to find anyone or Iâ€™m worried I will have to majorly settle in life due to my body. I also make a major effort to overcompensate in every other area of my life and it makes me worried that someone who is attractive and â€œout of my leagueâ€ will want to date me based on that not realizing and not expecting how my body will look. I went out on NYE and a guy who I never wouldâ€™ve expected to be interested in me came and talked to me and flirted with me for a while and interactions like this are starting to freak me out because I do not have a clear understanding of what I look like. I struggle with body dysmorphia and I donâ€™t see myself accurately and I canâ€™t understand why a 6â€™3 + really cute boy would ever be interested in me. My friends and everyone else makes non stop comments about how pretty I am and how good I look now and I get attention on tinder so Iâ€™m assuming I must look nice, but I donâ€™t see it and it makes so anxious."
CPTSD,I wish I was ugly so my dad didn't abuse me,I know this is silly. But it's true. I am a good looking guy who is sensitive and suprise girls like that! But I always mess it up out of fear that they only want to have sex with me. I hate the fact my dad abused me in that way and if I was ugly I would know someone loves me for my personality. I know this is silly but it is deep seated fear I have.

CPTSD,Severe depersonalization after burried memory coming back up?,"I've been suspecting since childhood that someone within my family assaulted me. I'm not sure, but there are small signs I've noticed when I was younger and subtly creepy behavior from my siblings. 

Recently I've been having nightmares of one of my siblings coming after me and forcing me to do things to them as I cried. I also started having dreams and memories of someone touching me and me recalling times I suspected I was touched (e.g. having a dream that someone touched me and then waking up and feeling like someone really did).

Now I feel like I'm having out-of-body experiences. And I feel kind of crazy. I'm aware of what I'm doing but very lightheaded and scared. The feeling went from just feeling unsafe to now feeling very disconnected from reality. I can't feel much. I am so scared."
CPTSD,What are some things that are often unrecognized regarding CPTSD?,"Hello,

I recently learned something about PTSD / CPTSD that I did not know before. For a while now, I have been using the word ""flashback"" tentatively when discussing my trauma with others in order to explain my experiences with traumatic memories and how my body responds to them. I didn't really feel like my experiences fit the definition of ""flashback,"" since I have mild aphantasia and rarely ""see"" the memory in my head (and if I do, it is fuzzy and/or in jumbled pieces.) However, I recently learned that ""emotional flashbacks"" are a thing, in which you do not necessarily ""see"" the memory and/or believe yourself to be truly in that moment again, but you *do* experience the same emotions that you did when you were initially traumatized. It explained so much about what I was feeling and experiencing and has helped me start learning how to handle things the best I can until I can leave my environment. 

So, I would like to extend this question to you all: 

What are some things about PTSD / CPTSD that are often unrecognized / not talked about very often or that you learned recently?

Feel free to respond with anything you'd like. :> "
CPTSD,How has CPTSD affected your social life?,"Do you currently have friends or family to talk to? Did you have a better social life when you were younger? Do people treat you differently? Are you open with people about your trauma? Do you desire to have more friends than you do now or are you ok with it? Was there a point where everything fell apart for you?

These are just a few questions I thought of off the top of my head, but you can answer however youâ€™d like. How has this condition affected you?"
CPTSD,Why do I feel like I need to be trauma dump?,"Not to people irl, but in general, like online lol. I just feel like I need to redump my trauma constantly and idk what I'm trying to accomplish.

I've been in therapy for a long time too"
CPTSD,Spiraling at work,"Hello,
Iâ€™m new to this forum but just need to vent.

I feel like the loose threads of a sweater that is about to come loose.

Iâ€™ve been at my job for a year and I feel like I completely suck. Itâ€™s my first â€œseriousâ€ job.

I have made so many mistakes that my boss has talked to me over and over. She finally gave me my last warning, saying Iâ€™m working too fast and not paying attention or detail oriented.

The problem is- I have paid attention. Iâ€™ve put so much pressure on myself to do better anytime Iâ€™ve been talked to. Implemented any suggestions they offered into my routine and stayed late to finish my work.
Iâ€™ve always had anxiety. Crippling anxiety. Also, I havenâ€™t felt worthy enough to be there.

When I make mistakes and get in trouble I feel like my anxiety gets so bad I make more mistakes and spiral. Iâ€™m having horrible panic attacks and they jolt me up out of a dead sleep at times. I feel like Iâ€™m being haunted.

I never graduated high school, and that has played a major role in why Iâ€™m feeling like this. However; this is exactly why I ran from high school. I had anxiety so bad and didnâ€™t know how to cope with it I gave up all together.
Iâ€™ve gone back to do my HSE and failed at the math over and over.

I feel like I suck at life. Worthless.

I finally had my first therapy session after months of waiting. I donâ€™t want to feel trapped and worthless anymore.

Thanks for reading."
CPTSD,VENT: Just Found Out I Have CPTSD Feeling Incredibly Ashamed,"So itâ€™s as the title says, I just found out Iâ€™ve been dealing with CPTSD and I feel so ashamed. This might be a bit scattered but I think I have to get this out. 

I moved away from my best friends because of a bunch of triggers I didnâ€™t process and talk about. I miss them every single day and I donâ€™t feel like I was a good friend to them. Weâ€™re still friends and they still love me and I love them, but I made a horrible mistake by moving away. What makes me so upset is the reason why I moved wasnâ€™t real. It was never ever real, it was a defense mechanism. 

So Iâ€™m in Art school right now studying animation. Back in highschool I ended up with a lot of trauma within friendships and that only grew in my second year of school. I moved in with my friends and i remember being tired and depressed the minute we moved in. I remember one day waking up and feeling like â€œoh no, ITS happening again.â€ I didnâ€™t know what IT was I just remember naming that horrible horrible feeling. I would get triggered all the time in that apartment and I constantly self isolated because in highschool, avoiding the hurt is what got me through. Moving into our second apartment together I took that guilt with me, I also took the aftermath of that experience in that apartment with me. We all shouldâ€™ve had a big talk about it, we never did.
I soon realized after my partner asked me out that I just, didnâ€™t feel any emotions anymore? And I was terrified because I am such a sensitive person then cycle began. I started getting triggered again, then more stressful events happened, a misunderstanding with my roommates, a confrontation with my roommates as one was upset with myself and my two other roommates, this confrontation occurred while I had just found out my partner had to get emergency surgery on their neck, while also being right in the middle of a relationship conflict with my partner, barely finishing my junior film, being in and out of the hospital and out of fear and anger I decided Iâ€™d move out after the lease was over. I didnt feel the care that I usually did, I was just angry and felt trapped. I was paranoid that they were talking about me, angry about dumb things and being petrified of any sort of conversation about feelings. It was only towards the end when I realized I didnâ€™t want this that I let my guard down and actually started getting close with all my roommates again. I regret leaving and Iâ€™m grieving the loss of that life I had.

I moved and now I know what itâ€™s actually like to live in a bad situation. And now I want to move again but because the situation is actually bad but I question myself all the time. I moved in with people I donâ€™t know well in a location two hours away from my school and job. I actually try and communicate my feelings but itâ€™s like talking to a forcefield constantly deflecting. I accidentally attracted mice and removed all of my belongings from the room to just try and dissuade them since itâ€™s been singled out that they are apparently only coming from my room. Iâ€™m so ashamed of that, Iâ€™m in constant fear that because I did this, something horrible is going to happen. Stepping into that apartment makes me feel like Iâ€™m going to throw up. The minute I was talked to in a way that made me uncomfortable and addressing it went as well as youâ€™d think, Iâ€™ve gone into a chronic stress and anxiety state once more. I want to leave so bad as soon as the mice situation is cleared up. Iâ€™ve found myself constantly masking and in survival mode with my roommates pissed about the mice and that Iâ€™m never home despite trying to bring across that I work and go to school two hours away and only have two-four hours in the day to do my homework especially during finals season when I was living at school to finish my projects. I realize itâ€™s unfair that they have to deal with the mice without me but I also feel like I physically do not have any more hours hours by the end of my days to commute back for 11pm. 

I have to mourn the fact that I left my best friends, missed out on a school trip because I was paranoid and moving, and made a rash decision because I was in a chronic state of fight or flight and felt like I needed to prove I could â€œchange my fateâ€ I live now in a constant state of fear I felt two years ago in that second year of college. When things actually went down. I have a friend who lives ten minutes from my school and I want to move. I realized I donâ€™t want to â€œstart overâ€ or be alone and isolated far away from everyone. I want to be with my community and my friends. I was so deep in my past trauma that I couldnâ€™t trust that I deserved to be in my community. I didnâ€™t believe my roommates would forgive me for being so unstable in second year. I thought they were against me. Knowing what that actually feels like has taught me that I reacted on a feeling. 

Realizing that I moved on my triggers is a horrible thing to come to terms with. Iâ€™m still in school and working (with a not very good insurance) so therapy isnâ€™t really in the cards right now. I think I just feel frozen. I know longer know what decision is the right one to take. The mouse situation feels so huge in my head despite living in a city. Apparently my unit is the only one with mice and additionally apparently the only entry points are in my room. This topped with just finishing the semester and being behind in my thesis film, and being between jobs. I ended up having a huge huge panic attack and feel absolutely 100% terrified of being in my apartment. My parents took me home for a few days to figure out what to do.

Iâ€™m sad because I worked very very hard to break myself out of this constant dissociation and derealization this past year only to feel violently thrown back in. I kind of constantly feel like an inconsiderate and bad friend, a bad roommate. At my old place I never acted upon the triggers abut I also never said anything at all, I stopped talking to absolutely everyone even my best friend from back home. I shut off and left. This time I feel like Iâ€™m slowly turning back on and realizing my new situation is significantly worse and that I just miss everyone so much.

Itâ€™s a good sign that I feel isolated and alone and i donâ€™t see it as a good thing anymore.

 I just wanted to speak the feelings I have on realizing I have been responding to not only past traumas but emotional trauma Iâ€™ve suffered as recently as two years ago. I donâ€™t know where to go from here, things may not be as bad as they feel but I canâ€™t really tell."
CPTSD,Question & Vent...? Communication Problems in Relationship,"First post here, I just found this subreddit and it already seems like a kind and safe place to be. I wonder if anyone else has dealt with similar issues and I just wanted to get a different perspective and or advice.

I've been struggling more and more with functional communication with my partner. I can't really say when it started but its been probably close to a year now. I thought that maybe I just needed to learn to simply communicate better or that it's just, I don't even know something that's just an easy like being mindful.

My partner tells me I've been overly defensive whenever we talk. That I've been coming off cold sometimes. He is taking this as I don't care about his feelings or I always think that he's coming to attack me with my words.

I'm don't even think I've entertained the idea of it being about my mental health and struggles with CPTSD. I've had a horrible childhood as I'm sure all of us here have. So it makes sense that I'm quick on the defense over anything at all.... but I have NO idea how to not be. It's like an automatic response to any slightly POTENTIAL conflict that I've imagined in my mind.

I also feel like if I bring up to my partner that I realize it's from my trauma it is simply going to come off as an excuse for my behavior. Like I'm saying I can be that way because my childhood was traumatic and I don't think that at all. But I don't know how to convey that I think nothing has gotten better in the past year with our communication because I've been ignoring the fact of WHY I am acting like that. It's not a personality trait, it's a defense mechanism from years of abuse.

&#x200B;

Have any of y'all had issues with your partner not understanding or not accepting that your past affects how you are today? Do you have any advice on how to not be so combative?"
CPTSD,Memory gaps - TW: Sexual abuse/childhood trauma,"I was assaulted as a child by my cousin and later during adolescence by my hockey coach who groomed me for over a year or more before he molested me. I'm someone who has been working with a trauma informed therapist and practicing EMDR and IFS. We never really dealt with my sexual assault at length but recently, something happened which triggered my memories of sexual assault that i experienced while growing up. 

We started doing EMDR and it got very heavy very quickly. My therapist was surprised because I was disassociating a lot. After three years of working with them and processing a lot of trauma, this was a little strange. They think that something more severe happened. More than I can remember. But I can't really recall more than some inappropriate touching. It's quite intense and I'm disassociating and anxious. Anybody else here who experienced sexual trauma at a young age and do not entirely remember it? How did you recover those memories?"
CPTSD,My dad killed himself infront of me last week. (NSFW),"I'll try and keep this brief I (23m) and my sister (19f) lost our dad recently. It was the 27th of December last year. (The same day his father died when he was younger)

For backstory, my dad had alcoholism and end stage cirrhosis of the liver. Towards the end he was sick all of the time, irrational due to endocarditis and an overall miserable person sometimes who made me feel like I was walking on eggshells around him. 

He was always like this aswell, when I was a child I was always being careful and critical of myself in his presence. I'm not sure how much this affected me over my life but I do believe this may have been a form of emotional abuse that feels like  left marks on me and the way I have gone through life. His way of handling things was always ""tough love"" and not communicating. ""Plying it forward"" so to speak. It was very hard to ever open up about personal issues without fear of lack of empathy or understanding.

It really hurts me because I did have love for him, and he did actually care it seemed in his own way, it was just very hard to see and understand sometimes. He had very questionable behaviour, he would say racist and out of pocket, and would flip out and get mad at me over very seemingly small things, such as leaving a bowl out and forgetting to put it into the dishwasher.

It felt like very often if I made a mistake or messed up I was always in fear of his reaction. I learned to tough it out and deal with it over time, and just sort of went with it. But it never fully felt right or resolved. Any criticism he had used to lead to an argument, but I learned to just not engage in the end. He was Italian, who I believe was taught similarly throughout his life from friends and family with a tough love mentality that he warped into his own agenda on parenting which was very different to my mother's (they split when I was 10 due to their differences) my mum left him and he was very depressed for a while. 

We are also both drug takers although I only smoke weed and take kratom, he only drank alcohol although he was taking Suboxone that I had from going through opioid addiction towards the end of his life that I recommend to him because it was safer for his liver which I think may have altered his desicions.

Anyway, last week he killed himself. Infront of me, with a can of mortein fly spray. He was already dying and very sick, but I have a hunch the mortein is what did it. 

On the 27th last month, I was walking up the stairs to get some food while he was laying on the couch as he does... Moments passed and I'm searching through the fridge until I hear the sound of a can spraying, I look over and see my dad inhaling mortein and scream. I ask him if he's trying to fuck with my head and why he did it ( he said he was thirsty ) 

I then wait for 5 minutes, he seemed okay. I looked up all the symptoms of what inhaling mortein can do, none explained that death can occur. So I explained to him that these where the symptoms and this is what he's in for and to have fun with that because I was sick to death of the abuse. I stole the mortein from him and went back downstairs. The next morning I awoke to finding him dead on the couch.

I screamed for my auntie in the neighbour house and we rushed to get the police and ambulance out. I explained everything, his autopsy results outline indications of only death being related to his liver condition.

It is very painful for me as I can't understand why he did that Infront of me, and how he died from it. I feel guilty sometimes, I also feel angry aswell. And also feel like he was trying to send me a message as a final way of him displaying his tough love agenda. My emotions have been terrible and unpredictable.

I keep looking for answers to why he would do that Infront of me.

The only things I can think of is that it was because I use drugs and he was an alcoholic who ""couldn't use drugs"" as he would say in the end. And that was his way of showing me that drugs are bad or something... 

I'm sorry I'm just looking for some help. I am deeply distraught, I just can't get it out of my head. I feel like what he did Infront of me was so hard to understand. I can accept he was out of his mind it still happened and he had something to say otherwise why did he wait to do it Infront of me... I've not always been in the greatest place and we have both struggled with addiction. I am constantly feeling torn between feelings of hatred and trying to understand him.

There was a lot of factors into our relationship, he was very successful before he got sick, and I think that fueled his ego which made him always right. And over the years I turned into a bit of a hermit as I'm mildly social anxious, I believe that might have contributed to his disappointment or dissatisfaction with me as his son. So I think he was blaming me and the drugs but I don't know.

Can anyway help me? How should I deal with these feelings? I have been trying to drown it and it doesn't really work, I'm choosing to be sober the last week but it's it's awfully challenging. please someone help me understand why my tough loving Italian narcissistic dad killed himself infront of me. He did have love but he showed it in this ""tough way"" it's only making me feel worse about myself. I need therapy but for the moment I am hoping anyone could chime in. Thanks for taking the time to read."
CPTSD,physical pain/injuries/scars from traumatic events,"tw: rape, childhood sa & torture, brief self-harm mention

Long story short, i have a hip injury from being raped at 17 that went untreated for over a year. I already have a genetic connective tissue disorder that causes severe joint and muscle pain, so this injury is made worse by this pre-existing condition. But there are days where the pain is so intense, I can barely walk or move. And with every wave of pain, Iâ€™m reminded of that day. Iâ€™m transported back to the moment the injury happened. Iâ€™m reliving those memories while dealing with severe pain. 

I also have scar tissue (some leading to somewhat severe deformities) in someâ€¦unsavory places from the sexual abuse I was subjected to as a child. I have scars on my upper arms and back from the physical torture the same man inflicted on me. 

In a similar vein, I have really bad body memories. Like I mentioned with the hip injury, I have flashbacks where I can physically feel when the injury occurred. I can feel the physical sensation and pain I felt when these events were happening. While these things didnâ€™t leave scars, I can still feel things like the electroshock or the feeling of being restrained.

Iâ€™m tired of living like this. Iâ€™m tired of this trauma overtaking my life. I hate that I have to relive these nightmares over and over and over again. It was one thing to go through it once, itâ€™s another to go through it emotionally every single day after that. I am so tired of the physical and emotional pain I feel. 

Iâ€™m tired of the now-physical reminders of the trauma Iâ€™ve endured. On top of this, I have a lot of very noticeable scars from past self-harm. I guess I just feel a lot of embarrassment. I feel like my body has been marked by this trauma and this pain, literally. I will never be able to escape bc I canâ€™t escape my body. Iâ€™m just tired of not having any control over anything, not even my body. Iâ€™m tired of these men still having control over my body."
CPTSD,To the men of this subreddit...how often do you cry?,
CPTSD,Close friends continue to invite my abuser to their events,"My highschool friendship group are toxic af on the whole tbh but what is really hurting me is that if the few who know that F assaulted me are still inviting him to their gatherings and events. One of the girls invited him to her engagement party recently and when asked about why she invited him said that heâ€™s more of an acquaintance and did it out of politeness. 

Iâ€™m so confused as, I personally would feel a stronger sense of like just not being a dick essentially, to my long term friend and known victim, notâ€¦ an acquaintance?

This kind of thing happens all the time and both myself and another close friend have asked members of the group about why they keep inviting both of us to these things? 

Note: I have even said I donâ€™t mind the friendship but donâ€™t involve me and him ever. I feel like I would have been ok with them inviting just him and not me even.

Sorry. TLDR: ya bitch is sad because my friends seemingly value a rapistsâ€™ feelings over mine #slay"
CPTSD,Insomnia is a hell like no other.,"I'm so very, very tired.  Weary to the point that it becomes brain fog.  It's been a long day, and I want nothing but sleep.  But I can't.  The fear won't let me.  I have literally no certainty about my future at all, nobody who can support me, so even the standard techniques of self-reassurance don't work - I can't comfort myself through self-parenting because I don't have the resources to be a parent, not even to myself.  Even my partner's comforting touch does nothing tonight (*occasionally* it's exactly what I need, and helps the tears come, but no dice on nights like this), and she also has no job at the moment and is struggling to find one.  I can't make the anxiety stop, because anxiety is objectively appropriate, but I can't function well enough to even stand a chance of combating the sources of that anxiety as long as it's making me miss hours and hours and hours of sleep every damned night.  

EDIT: Sorry that this post doesn't have a whole lot of direction to it, I'm not really asking for replies, I just had a pressing need to *express* this.  And writing it is about all I've got the brainpower to do when I'm this incredibly tired, to try to cope with the unbearable boredom of waiting to also be sleepy.  I swear, ""may you be forever tired but never sleepy"" would be amongst the most evil curses imaginable."
CPTSD,Are incestuous feelings a sign of CSA?,"Without going into detail.....not necessarily outright desire to have sex with family, but thoughts/feelings that one would normally have towards a partner."
CPTSD,Has anyone made friends with someone who also has C-PTSD that's completely unrelated to your own?,"I'm starting to feel like I'm in over my head. This is technically a friend of a friend who just moved to my town. I helped out with the move and was really excited to have someone I get along with live near me (I have no local friends). At first it was great because we have a lot of common interests and it was really nice to have someone new to hang out with and talk to. But then he and his girlfriend broke up (mostly because he was in a downward spiral with his trauma and being verbally abusive to her and she couldn't take it anymore) and now I feel like I'm his only support system and I'm exhausted. I've spelled out everything that helped me, talked to him in the middle of the night, brought him easy to eat food, and nothing seems to even make a dent in being helpful. I'm so overwhelmed because my own family has given me a lot of new things to process in the last couple of weeks (one so bad I think you guys are the only ones who wouldn't be surprised someone would do it to their own kid) so I'm already struggling to manage myself and keep myself in a healthy state. At the same time, I'm the only one in his life who knows what it's like inside his head, so I do feel some responsibility to support him. I hate seeing him so nonfunctional, but I'm also torn because it's been a week and he hasn't done a single thing that could be remotely counted as being helpful/productive/healing (things like eat a meal or sleep more than an hour or two). Does anyone have any suggestions on how to manage this or other things that might be helpful for him?"

Today I screamed at my abusive ex for a good hour about all the things he's done to me - from the 14 years of cheating to rape. For almost 2 years I've been holding onto him scared to lose him. He and my daughter are my only family. My entire family abandoned me and my daughter after we won a lifetime restraining order against my mom. I love him so much but I'm exhausted. I'm tired of begging him to stop hurting me. I've demanded him to explain to me why he's done this to me so many times... And in the end that doesn't matter. Even if I knew the truth it doesn't help. I've never hurt so much in my life... But for the first time after screaming at him, I felt this exhaustion and defeat. I can't do this anymore. I don't care that he texted me tonight. I've never left him on read in our entire relationship until today. I'm just exhausted and I want to forget him. 14 years. We were so compatible and in love, but when I found out about all the lies almost 2 years ago everything fell apart. I think I'm finally done trying to save the relationship, him or even just talking to him. 

I really hope this continues because I want it to be over."
CPTSD,I hate euphemisms,For example youâ€™re too nice. Really they mean youâ€™re a pussy. I know this because the same people remove that polite mask when angry or too comfortable. I hate being this weak worm and want to 180 my behavior. Even to the extent of alienating family.
CPTSD,Hate myself,"For my whole life I was criticized for being too nice, soft, a pushover. I was an easy target for bullies and to this day I donâ€™t stand up for myself as much as Iâ€™d like. I made it my MO to never let anything slide anymore and every time I do I hate myself more.

My parents both treated me like a pushover and try to run over me while simultaneously criticizing my politeness and soft spokenness.
I feel alienated from the world and feel like a worm. Now I have a feeling in my gut like I want to humiliate and hurt them and everyone else who trys me in the slightest. Though I am not strong verbally. I hate it and I donâ€™t want to go to jail for some stupid shit. I can fight but life diesnâ€™t work like that anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do"
CPTSD,Dreading every day,I dread going to work every single day and spend the whole day just waiting for it to end and then I come home completely depleted feeling like thereâ€™s never enough time in the evening to decompress or reset before I have to do it all over again. Iâ€™m stuck in this cycle and severely depressed and Iâ€™m not sure what I can do to make it better.
CPTSD,"CPTSD and relationships, how do I overcome this?","I really donâ€™t have family who I can talk to. I donâ€™t have a very loving family, either. They have always been the â€œsuck it upâ€ type. My dad, mom, and grandparents donâ€™t know anything about me. Narcissists run rampant in my family.  I donâ€™t have siblings. My dad (who I live with) doesnâ€™t even know Iâ€™ve been in a relationship for 5 years because heâ€™d have my head if he knew I was dating outside of my race. I have always had to keep my entire life quiet, and I am very good at being sneaky and secretive because of it. My friends, as we grow older, are growing more and more unavailable. I feel really alone and just wish I had that family I could go to. Just one family member who would rub my back while I cry and listen to me about my issues and give me advice and love me unconditionally. I remember going back as far as a child pretending to soothe myself to sleep or clean and fix my cuts the way a mother would. I donâ€™t care how old you are, everyone needs a mother or a loving family member even if it is once in a while.

Anyways, this perpetual loneliness seems to have bled into my love life and I hate it. I have tried repeatedly to break up with this man over the course of our relationship, but then Iâ€™m completely alone and I feel guilty because the man is literally perfect in every which way and I convince myself Iâ€™m self destructing by breaking up with him. He is the only man who has ever treated me decent. 

Yes, I have hobbies and yes I have a full time job and friends and yes I see a psychiatrist and I have tried therapy, but I still feel so alone that I get sick. I havenâ€™t been single since high school and Iâ€™m 23 now. I always had back ups, always had someone there. I donâ€™t want to be single and I donâ€™t want to be alone. I want someone there to listen to me cry and to hang out with and to comfort me. If you took a relationship out of the equation, I have no one. Friends only go so far. I donâ€™t want to self soothe anymore and I am so tired. I am scared to be alone because Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll fall back into how I was at 18/19 when I let guys use me thinking that would make them want to love me (hopefully I know better but the CPTSD brain works in awful ways). When I break up with him, I canâ€™t breathe and itâ€™s not even really him, itâ€™s that sick loneliness. And that fear that I will be alone forever or wonâ€™t be able to find anyone remotely better. 

Does anyone else relate? Anyone overcome this?"
CPTSD,i'm stuck.,"my partner is controlling, puts me down, and makes me feel unwanted. i could move back home...but i'd be living with the ""mother"" who neglected me and her boyfriend who told me i'd never do anything worthwhile with my life - all because i tried to protect her from his verbal abuse. living alone isn't an option. i don't know what to do."
CPTSD,Voluntarily going to a csu and I'm upset about it,"I almost made it 2 years without having to go to the hospital or a csu and I'm so disappointed in myself for breaking that streak. I've been struggling a lot over the past 2 months and I'm reaching my breaking point. I haven't been this emotionally unstable in a couple years and I'm so upset about it. I feel like a disappointment and a failure. I know that I'm not and that it's good I'm being proactive about my mental health, but it doesn't change how weak I feel. 

I fucking hate my ex so much, he ruined everything for me. I was doing so well, I was getting a hold of my anxiety. My depression was almost non-existent and my sleep was good. But no, I can't have that. No no no, I can't be doing good. The mother fucker just HAD to come to my house COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE. He came here at the beginning of November and I am still fucked up because of it. He knows that I am mentally ill and that I struggle a lot with severe anxiety that is closely tied to my ptsd. And what does he do? FUCKING COMES TO MY HOME, RETRAUMATIZING AND COMPLETELY VIOLATES MY SAFE SPACE. I HAD TO SEE HIS STUPID FUCKING FACE AGAIN AND NOW IT RANDOMLY POPS UP IN MY STUPID BRAIN. EVERY FUCKING TIME I WALK BY MY GODAMN WINDOW I SEE HIM. I SEE HIM WHEN IM ON MY PORCH OR LOOKING AT THE PARKING LOT. I SEE HIM EVERYWHERE AT MY HOME. I CANT EVEN HAVE THIS YEAR AS A FRESH START BECAUSE I GOTTA GO TO COURT FOR THIS SHIT NEXT MONTH

I HATE HIM. I HATE HIM. I HATE HIM. I FUCKING HATE HIM SO MUCH!!!!! 

I'm so miserable, I don't want to die but I don't want to live either. I just don't want to exist. I'm so tried of always living in constant anxiety and having memories replaying in my head. I just want peace. I am shaking all day and night, I have random heart palpitations and I have random hot flashes. I have to remind myself to breathe because I'm holding my breath without realizing it. I can't go outside and when I do I feel like I'm on the verge of passing out or I cry uncomfortably. I hate how entangled he is in my childhood trauma, there's many memories I have from childhood that reminds me of him. I can't even have my own trauma without him trying to be in it. I guess he wins because it's what happened. He won the battle but won't win the war. I won't let him keep me like this, I will throw his ass in the trash where he belongs."
CPTSD,DAE feel like they have healed but still self harm in times of great stress,"I feel that over the past decade I have really and truly moved beyond a lot of my childhood abuse and severe trauma. HOWEVER over the past few months I have struggled with emotional outbursts after relocating back to my hometown where my years of abuse happened. It has been full of flashbacks, nightmares, and other textbook ptsd signs. One thing that has stuck out to me though is that I feel like I have reverted to self harming without meaning toâ€¦when I get extremely frustrated (mind you I have felt INTENSELY more on edge during this period too) I slap, hit, or pinch myself really hard. Iâ€™ve not struggled with this for so so many years but today I found myself escaping to the bathroom because of intense emotions of self hatred and slapping/hitting myself in the head face. I am so ashamed of thisâ€¦but I also know that adding shame will not help the situation and that this also stems from a deep rooted self loathingâ€¦Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone of you have also experienced this type of reversion? When I was a teenager and even as young as 10 I would scratch, pinch, punch, slap myselfâ€¦.you name it. I havenâ€™t struggled with that though Iâ€™m easily more than a decade and now it has happened maybe 3 times in the past few months."
CPTSD,cPTSD support groups,"Iâ€˜m wondering if any of you have found cPTSD support groups in your community? If so, do you find support there? Is it any easier to feel a sense of community or have relationships with other cPTSD survivors or is it the same?"
CPTSD,Questions regarding medication,"I've been through all the SSRIs. I'd been doing really well but since having kids my anxiety is literally through the roof. I'm having terrible fear all the time surrounding my children and it's controlling my life. I'm in a happy marriage but I don't trust my kids with anyone else beside me and my mom. And even my own brain is constantly attacking itself saying don't you dare ""insert horrible mistake"" and then I visualize it. It's like a flashback of something that never happened. I am really dedicated and my children's health and safety come first but I'm really not taking care of myself. I don't eat and my sleep is constantly interrupted despite me being constantly exhausted. My ssri side effects are irritability, bad short term memory, exhaustion, and night terrors. 
Selexa, wellbutrin, Lexapro, and zoloft have all not worked for me. I have a psych appointment Monday and I just don't even know where to start. I literally have no depression but my anxiety is constant."
CPTSD,"Do you believe that people thatâ€™ve been horrible to us, gets everything they want?",I wonder how many others feel this is true? Iâ€™ve read it on Instagram and came here for a discussion.
CPTSD,What did you learn in 2023?,"I kept a journal all throughout 2023--it was probably the first year that I regularly & consistently journaled. I did it almost every day from Jan - Aug, then did it a little less by the end of the year. Each month I would highlight ""insights"" and ""action items"" from my entries, and this week I went back through them all to look for overall themes. 



I started the year pretty lost, feeling empty, feeling like something needed to shift but I didn't know what. Mid-year I began learning more about CPTSD, and began applying it to my own experiences for the first time. Then came a period of immense grief where I looked at my relationship with my parents honestly and realized they would never support me as my true, unique self. I realized that once I am able to move out, I will probably need to go either very low contact, or no contact at all, in order to move forward with my life. Once I was through that grief, I was able to reflect on my growth. Currently I'm sort of ""waiting"" for an opportunity to make progress in my life, because I still need to get financially stable before the moving out and cutting them off can happen. But things feel good now, like I am at the beginning of a new cycle, a new chance. 



4 major themes also emerged of things I often thought about in 2023, which I plan to integrate into my healing work for 2024:  
* **Freedom:** I often wrote about things that make me feel free, such as ""spending time on creative activities,"" ""being physically fit,"" ""visiting new places,"" etc. For 2024 I plan to use some of these as my goals, ultimately chasing the feeling of ""freedom"" as my ideal. 

* **Imprisonment:** Conversely, I often wrote about feeling trapped / stuck. Things that made me feel trapped included, ""living under capitalism,"" ""being a woman in a misogynistic society,"" and ""repeating cycles."" I've decided these are things I need greater detachment from. Many were things that I probably cannot change (like capitalism...) so I will need to figure out how to move forward anyways. 

* **Life:** I wrote sometimes about things that made me feel alive, like ""feeling sunshine,"" ""tasting chocolate,"" ""listening to music,"" etc. I decided these are activities I should turn to for self-care when I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

* **Death:** I also wrote about things that ""felt like death,"" aka thoughts / behaviors that felt hopeless when I encountered them. For example ""the fear that I am unable to heal,"" ""feeling like I need to hide my true self,"" or ""taking on a role of maintaining the peace."" Interestingly for this one I also sometimes wrote about death as a chance for destruction and rebirth, a chance to transform the self. I have decided this is my shadow work category. I want to dig to the root of my fears, and transform my understanding of them to figure out how I can grow and transform anyways. I believe some of these issues are still at the core of why it has been so hard for me to just move forward and live life the way I want to, and I know I'm closer to solving that, but I'm not there quite yet. 




Anyways, I would love to hear about any insights you all had over the past year when it comes to your healing work. How far have you come? What are your goals for 2024?"
CPTSD,Iâ€™m happy?,"Itâ€™s weird saying it, but I think for the first time in a while, Iâ€™m actually doing okay. 

For context, I spent the last three years processing a lot of my trauma. While it was super painful, heart-wrenching, and lonely, I think I finally got to a point where I feel okay. Happy even. Itâ€™s a weird feeling to have since itâ€™s been so long since I felt genuinely excited. But itâ€™s a good one. 

Iâ€™m proud of myself for doing the emotional work to get me to where I am. Life isnâ€™t perfect, but I feel happy with where I am in life and am looking forward to seeing what comes next. 

I guess, if youâ€™ve gotten this far, I hope youâ€™re in a good place. And if youâ€™re not, please remember that thereâ€™s hope for a better tomorrow. ðŸ’›âœŒðŸ¼"
CPTSD,Romantic feelings,"Does anyone else just not feel romantic feelings? No related to  asexuality ofc. Like you did and had crushes before, but now any time you even try itâ€™s just an empty void of nothingness?"
CPTSD,DAR feel really disconnected and â€œseparateâ€ from people who are able to actually regulate their emotionsâ€¦.,"****was supposed to be DAE*****

I noticed today that I stopped making eye contact with my bf

I feel so alone and isolated and sad and he didnâ€™t do anything to make this happen, Iâ€™m just falling apart and making myself more miserable by pushing away the one person who is 100% there for me

I guess I feel a lot of shame in relationships and maybe that I donâ€™t deserve any kind of relationship"
CPTSD,I just want to go back to not knowing,"I want to go back to not knowing what happened. Going back to that man who could still have hope. Going back to not knowing asking for help would not help you. I was better wheb I didnâ€™t had that hope.

I want to go back a few years when not everyone was married. Or having children."
CPTSD,DAE feel the conflict of wanting to keep yourself safe but wanting to have adventures?,I used to be so intrepid. I loved traveling and doing new stuff. Now so much trauma has threatened my body that I get nervous about getting hurt again. Itâ€™s like I have this fiery adventurous spirit but am constantly held back by fear of getting catastrophically hurt. I want to be safe and feel safe but I want to have fun and live my life too!!!!
CPTSD,I ended my longest friendship today,"Ive been working through alot of things in therapy since i regressed in my ocd after being around child abuse in a remote work camp and having all my coworkers normalize it a year and a half ago. Since then ive been struggling with â€˜real eventâ€™ ocd partly triggered because of my cptsd, thats been making me verbally tic. 

After i aged out of foster care ive been put in situation after situation that went against my beliefs and morals, and since fighting to prove emotional abuse to secure my place in foster care, ive had alot of difficulties continuing to fight for myself or others when i get any pushback. I just remember how exhausting it is and how difficult it is to speak the truth when someones scoffing at you and calling you a liar in the corner, or just how even speaking the truth can hurt someone you care about or love deeply. I dont like to hurt people.  When someone gets mad when i stand up and say something, (like call the police in a dangerous situation or inform the parents of a child that my boyfriends mother endangered without their knowledge) i just crumble and fold. I question everything, even when i know im right. 

Ive isolated myself alot because it feels like no matter where i turn ill just be forced into another situation where im hated if i do anything, and i hate myself if i dont. Somedays it feels like theres no winning and too much pain. Its easier to isolate, even though i know how unhealthy that is and how much its literally tearing me up inside. (Hence the reoccurrence of my ocd; real event intrusive thoughts and verbal tics each time i have them.) 

My friend had a child two years ago. Before she was pregnant with her first, sadly she miscarried. Before she miscarried her first child she was using drugs regularly and in a volatile relationship (evicted for fighting) with a drug dealer who in her own words â€˜couldnt work a normal jobâ€™. 

Ive always been extremely adamant that children and drug dealers dont mix. Thats not something she was unaware of. My father was a violent drug dealer who committed way worse crimes than just dealing because of the lifestyle. Ones I probably cant mention on here.  I have alot of trauma related to that. He died before i was a teen. But the first time i drank whisky i was 4 and 5 was the first time i smoked pot. Got my first gun under the tree at 4 too. Ive gone through alot of things, including having to get over my own idolization of drug dealers and that lifestyle which for a short period led me down a bad path. But never once has my opinion about drug dealers and kids changed. Ive always believed youre guaranteeing some sort of trauma if you have a child and you deal drugs. And i didnt want any part of it. By the time i was 20 i had seen foster sisters get addicted and prostituted, id seen two friends die and my boyfriend almost die in bed beside me. Homelessness and drug addiction was becoming more and more visible in my community, and so i stopped. I dropped all my friends, i helped my boyfriend quit, and ive continued to watch my community and people with similar backgrounds as me struggle and die. It sucks and i dont want to be around the people who contribute to that, or excuse it. You dont kick someone whos already down. In the current state of things theres no moral ground you can stand on if youre dealing drugs laced with fent. 

When she told me she was keeping the baby (she had previously stated several times she was wanting an abortion and that she was hoping she could party and miscarry if you get what im saying) i realized i couldnâ€™t be a part of her life at that time. I told her that as nicely as possible, said i still loved and care about her. She was upset and blocked me. Not a big surprise, i understood. Over a year later she messaged me asking if we could rekindle the relationship and that her situation had changed. Ie no drugs, boyfriend had a real job and wasnt a drug dealer and she was pregnant again. I obviously agreed because i still did want to be friends. 

But she lied and i didnt find out until a year later, after she had named me his godmother. I felt stuck. And betrayed. I didnt say anything for another two years. While working through therapy after ive regressed ive realized i need to stop enabling that behaviour and being worried about other peoples reactions because it was seriously impacting my mental health. Everytime shed talk about the money they excessively spent, the 6k on takeout every month because it would cost more for him to cook then be out drug dealing and buy takeout, her new braces, their upcoming trip to italy and scotland. I couldnt do it. Everytime i was just so angry inside.  I dont want to fucking hear about all the blood money youre spending made off the back from the most disadvantaged people in our community, while having a child.  I dont want to hear about his sketchy partners and his bullshit that endangers their child. And I definitely dont want to fucking hear about how the nurse that checks in on them every two months says â€˜theyre great parentsâ€™. I just dont. Because they arent and they arent â€˜goodâ€™ people and it really fucking bothers me that she could go through her own struggle with her parents (who were abusive, just not with drugs) and still think thats okay. Not to mention reinvolve me in that situation when she knew it went against my morals and was connected to past trauma.  

And thats the entire reason i didnt want to be around her before. I cant not be angry. it just fucking sucks my childhood best friend has chosen a life that goes against my own long held morals and beliefs that are based off of personal experience. Like what are the god damn chances. I just wish life was easier sometimes.

Today I told her we should take a step back. Nicely. Said i was hurt and i still loved her, i didnt say how angry i was or say anything i really wanted to because it would have hurt her and thats not what i want. She can live her life, and i hope she has a great life. I just dont want to be around it or hear about it because it pains me deeply. And i cant keep that all bottled up and let the resentment spill out other ways, everyone deserves supportive friends, and i cant be that for her. She has other people in her life that dont have personal trauma and beliefs that collide with her lifestyle. And its not healthy for me to be around people who normalize the type of trauma and abuse i went through for so many years. 

I just needed to vent. Im really sad. But i have to start living my life in a way where i can be happy with myself, and my decisions. And i need to remember that doing the right thing often makes you sad, or isnt easy, people can be mad or hate you, but its easier than letting it slide and pushing it down in the long run. Ive unfortunately been learning that lesson for over a year now. If you got to the end, thanks for listening â¤ï¸"
CPTSD,"Do you repeatedly forget that you're ""ill""?","Today I had a medication review with a new psychiatrist, so he wanted to do a full history. It took two hours, and I am completely fried. But what really struck me was, he was the first clinician to go through my ENTIRE medication history, and he said:

""From what I can see in your file, you've been receiving medical support for your mental health for over 10 years. That's a really long time to be unwell.""

And it was with no judgement, it was just the facts as they are. In fact it was said with the most compassion I've ever heard. It has been a really long time that I have been unwell. 

And even though I'm medicated and going through the therapy system, I still never remember the fact that I'm unwell when I'm judging my decisions and behaviour. I'm so critical of myself for getting things wrong and making mistakes, and never think ""it's okay, you're actually pretty unwell"" even though that is a perfectly accurate statement."
CPTSD,Stress tolerance appointments and events,"I cannot handle any changes or surprises in my day to day life without having a severe panic attack or flashbacks of varying degrees and types from fight/flight volatile instinctive reactions, to dissociating and losing track of time, space and my body, to being frozen mentally and physically but still aware whatâ€™s happening (I am medicated, do EMDR therapy, and have a psychiatrist for 3 years). 

Whatâ€™s worse is when I have an upcoming appointment, whatâ€™s even worse is when things lined up and I have 3 appointments in one week, and another the next week, unexpected car troubles. 

I feel completely dysregulated due to this and at this point know how to identify that i have a certain capacity with how much i can take on or experience in one week based on my history, patterns, triggers Iâ€™m aware of, and discussing with therapist and psychiatrist these problems. 

I wanted to see if anyone experiences this lack of stress tolerance when there are too many stressful appointments and social meetings in one week: does it also induce heightened flashbacks/ fight/flight or panic attacks?  

I had a bad flashback last night and my neck back and body feels like it got ran over. I had a family member who was making plans and asking us what would work- when I said this weekend will probably not work for me because I have too many appointments and will not be able to handle back to back stress aka flashbacks and panic attacks, so this weekend wonâ€™t work for me at least. I got the response of ""there are 10 other peoole too"" too bad, essentially in the most rude tone as if i am
just being selfish for responding to the question.

This was triggering me immensely fight/flight and texted my family member i am
sick of my problems being framed this way, i
talk to my therapist about these problems and am told it is the right thing also to be realistic with my capacity and honor my bodys needs to be grounded. i was trying to be realistic with my capacity and not just some selfish choice. i feel like family picks and chooses when to take
into account my stress window and disorders/ mental illnesses despite they witness my inability to adapt or partake in several areas of life, 
i also have ocd germophobia and agoraphobia i have worked on to even get to be able to go to in person appointments or any social gatherings.

I also wanted to see if your family frames your capacity of how much you can take on in one week as selfishness, or if they understand you have lower stress tolerance window and are being preventive so you do not have intense and painful mental/physical flashbacks? 

It is hurtful mean and triggering when itâ€™s framed in this way when you are trying to be self aware and responsible with your capacity and known patterns. But some tend to twist the intent when they are not happy you have a stress disorder and pretend that context doesnt matter."
CPTSD,Do we get to move on?,"Genuinely. I think Iâ€™m incapable of loving someone or being loved.

Has anyone else experienced this? 

Has anyone felt like this and been able to move on?

Do we get to be loved? Do I get to move on? Will I ever love someone? Is that possible?

Be honest. This has been eating at me for years and I need to know if it will ever get better."
CPTSD,"Bit by bit I see in others the parents I've never had, and never will.","Over the past few years I've begun to understand the type of ""parents"" I had growing up, by watching other people parent their children, and hearing stories of the way acquaintances have parented their children. When you're raised in environments that are strictly uncaring, abusive and neglectful, your only knowledge of your surroundings is that it is normal. 

I realize however that none of the people I grew up with, blood parents or otherwise, were ever actually present for me. I was always alone. I have no photographs with any of them, from childhood or adolescence. They never took photos with me, they never took photos of me! My only childhood photos are school and yearbook photos! And I remember my 'father' at age 6 saying I looked ugly in my new glasses. The only photos that existed of me then were hated. Between the multiple men who took place as my father, I received two hugs between them in all my life. Only one from the women who took place as mother. (I remember feeling physically sick whenever I saw someone getting a hug. I would never know that.)

More recently I found myself in a situation where I was subordinate to a team lead in an abroad work-related team building exercise, and got sick for an entire week. The team lead asked me every day that I was sick how I was feeling, if I was okay - he seemd genuinely concerned. I realized this was more concern coming from a complete stranger than I'd ever received when I was sick growing up. Every time I got the question I'd cry to myself after. When I got sick as a child I was left in my room with a pale. No one ever held me, took care of me, 'rubbed my back' as I hear so many examples of... left alone in my room while sick with the TV on... TV was always on. If I ever got sick by accident outside the bathroom or pale I got in trouble for it... a few times my ""mother"" made me ""clean up \[my\] mess!"" myself.

In fact, once - when I was 16, I stepped on a rusty nail sticking out of one of the floor boards in the house I was then living at. I was instantly bleeding all over the floor and I cried out for help (it went quite deep), and when my ""father"" saw what happened, he started screaming at me. How stupid could i be to not ""watch where the fuck I \[was\] going?!"" Because it was rusty they thought they had to take my to the hospital (the myth being rusty nails are the culprit of tetanus), interrupting his plans to sit on his ass on the couch eating bag after bag of potato chips, drinking shitty beer and watching that fucking idiot show 'King of the Hill'. But I ruined his Saturday night. I've never forgotten this episode. 

When I hear about fathers who love their daughters, take them to do fun things like museums and carnivals, hug them, cuddle then, kiss them, hold their hand, I cry instantly. I fall apart. Tears are welling in my eyes right now just thinking about it. I'll never have a father. Who could I have been had I had a loving father instead? Recently I was at a museum and I saw a father showing his young daughter a display in their gallery of Ancient Greece. And of course the young girl was on her phone the whole time, uninterested in the tour her father was giving her. I saw and watched the scene play out and it killed me inside. I had to leave because I couldn't stop the tears. I just wanted to tell her how lucky she is to have a father interested and invested in her enough to give her the gift she was just throwing away! I'd give my life to have one day with a father who could do this for me. 

But I will never have a father. The pain of this realization physically hurts me. "
CPTSD,Unhealthy doesn't always equal abuse â¤ï¸,"I've been trying to figure out a way to say this, that makes sense. 

I think, we tend to think of unhealthy, or toxic, behavior, as always equating to abusive. And that can make us afraid or unwilling to look at our own behavior critically. I know I was terrified at the prospect of figuring out that my own behavior might be toxic, because I felt that would make me ""just like my abusers.""

But, there's a whole spectrum of unhealthy behavior, that doesn't involve abusing people (although there's a lot of nuance here, and some of what I'm about to list could lead to abusive behaviors)

- not knowing how to set boundaries

- not knowing when to put yourself first

- not feeling comfortable voicing your needs

- being afraid to communicate

The first, and most important, thing I'd like to say is, engaging in unhealthy behavior DOES NOT MAKE YOU LIKE YOUR ABUSERS. 

It's *normal* after trauma to experience these things. These things are not intrinsic aspects of your personality that you cannot change. These things can be helped so much through processing your trauma.

I think for me, a big portion of why I had so much trouble with healthy communication was the toxic shame that was foisted on me by my abusers. It made me distrustful and afraid of people. Once I fully internalized that I am and always have been a person who's worthy of care and respect, communication became so much easier. 

I wanted to share this because I know so many of us struggle with these things. And I hope so much that you, dear reader, will find healing. Because you deserve it. You always have â¤ï¸"
CPTSD,Hi - i am wondering for anyone who has/had experience in either IP/PHP/IOP for their ptsd - if itâ€™s normal to still â€œprocessâ€ memories u didnâ€™t get to directly in treatment?,"TLDR- basically just the literal title. 

but to elaborate, sry so long! the situation i was in that led to me getting diagnosed with (c)ptsd (i feel like i liar if i say cptsd instead of ptsd because my chart only lists it as ptsd for the dsm code i believe?) but that situation lasted 6 years of my life and was constant so thereâ€™s a lot there, if that makes sense. but i was in PHP/IOP from may-halloween and got transferred from the first one to a specialized ptsd specific program after they diagnosed me with ptsd at the first place. 

my symptoms at that point were genuinely physically debilitating as well as mentally torturous,  so, i took a hiatus from law school to do the ptsd program. overall, treatment helped me a lot.

but my question is whether itâ€™s ok/normal to keep processing difficult specific abuse memories/managing flashbacks that may have been triggered that u hadnâ€™t thought about ever since it happened/thought about in years. thankfully doing much better today than the past few days but just worried if this is normal at this point in the hopefully recovery timeline tysm to anyone. i canâ€™t tell if this is me being unrealistic in what healing is, tho, so feel free to (hopefully kindly) lmk if thatâ€™s what u think, too ðŸ¤"
CPTSD,How to stop disassociating at work???,"Please, looking for any advice. I end up looking so stupid all the time and I canâ€™t stand it. Iâ€™m a smart person I know it, I just turn dumb around others because Iâ€™m not doing what Iâ€™m good at in this job and Iâ€™m barely there in the moment just trying to get through the day. If you also go through this feel free to share and commiserate as well."
CPTSD,I'm tired of this. I'm to stuck on this shit.,"We were talking about things we should have sold at the dinner table when my (22m) sister (20f) brought up the pokemon card thing. I hate when I get reminded of the recent pokemon card selling craze because I think about how my parents (53f/54m) forced me to give mine up to my sister when I was 8. She wishes she saved them. I wish I still had them before my parents took them from me and probably lied about my intentions. And maybe I'm getting beat up over trivial shit, but I also wish I had parents that didn't treat us like two halves, one of which is ""okay to hit,"" and lie too on the basis that I've been diagnosed with autism since 5 and have ""black and white irrational thinking."" My sis probably thinks I'm crazy for getting all stern at the dinner table saying, ""They weren't yours! Mom and Dad coerced me into giving them to you,"" before walking off while our parents act dumbfounded. She always comes to bat for them pretty much, even when they lie to me, shove me out the room when I breath too loud in my sleep for her, physically abuse me, and say I'm a burden. If I told her friends any of this stuff maybe she'd lose some of them. Though our parents are too amazing in her eyes to be like this.

Maybe I should just let it all go, given I'm literally 22 and I hope to move out this year. Crazy how I'm such a tragedy that my Mom feels the need to express the irrelevant fact she has an autistic child in an article about her painting exhibition, yet I'm able to move out, finish college, get a job, live independently, and hopefully fucking distance myself from these mind games.

PS: Does anyone else feel like nobody in their family believes them, and wonders if they're just lying about their family so it's easier to feel sorry for themselves? My therapist calls the reason behind this feeling ""gaslighting,"" but why does nobody else get upset at my parents on my behalf?"
CPTSD,How do you feel real?,"What affects me the most from CPTSD is dissociation. I'd say I haven't had a day in the last five years that I have felt real. I always feel like I'm watching through a camera lens, like in movies when they are showing someone's perspective. It's like I'm my brain, not my body. Big disconnect there. 

For those of you who have experienced this, what has helped?

I have done some grounding practices throughout the years, but I feel like what I've done hasn't grounded me into my body, just my space. 

I do see a therapist, a lot, and they are amazing, I'm just looking for more perspectives. Thank you ðŸ’š"
CPTSD,"5 Months no contact with abuser, need support","Hello! This is my first time posting here. I really need words of guidance and reassurance. This month marks 5 months after going no contact with my mom, who is the largest contributer to my CPTSD. I don't really want to go into what she did or why I went no contact, partially because it's a very long story, but also because my therapist has been working with me on not oversharing. What I'm really looking for is support. 

Since I was sixteen I've struggled with seasonal depression, but this year was by far the worst. I spend every year in fear of my mom, dreading seeing her during the holidays, and I thought that being no contact would make that better, but it didn't. I spent the last two and a half months in a constant mix of feeling terrified she would contact me, either to scream at me or to just pretend everything is normal, and grief from not having her. I feel numb having gone through my birthday, my nieces and nephews birthdays, the birth of my youngest nephew, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years without hearing from her. I constantly find myself thinking about the good times from when I was young, and just end up feeling confused. I should hate her. This should be easy, but it's not. I know I need to talk to my therapist about this, and my therapist knows I have been struggling to an extent, but I keep finding myself avoiding the subject. 

This all has been really hard. I felt both distraught and relieved when I finally went no contact, and for each significant event since. I still think of her every day.

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you navigate these feelings? Was there anything you did that helped you?"
CPTSD,I'm worried that my sister has been molested,"My sister shows some stereotypical signs of sexual abuse, like wetting the bed until she was 12, and tending to hypersexualize herself. She also showers very often and avoids looking at herself in the mirror. I can't ask her about it, cause she might be like me, or she might just lie. For context, I have extremely spotty memories of my childhood, I basically only remember times where I wasn't in my house. Also, we are both still currently in our house, and there is no way to leave, considering I'm 15 and she's 13. I am also physically disabled. Any advice?"
CPTSD,Is it normal that I culturally associate with a time period I never lived in?,"My adolescence and early adulthood (roughly 2011-2020) was hell.

CPTSD,tw: animal death- in need of support,"i truly didnâ€™t know where else to post this, but iâ€™m floundering rn and need support from people who can understand how negative emotions can be so debilitating and physically painful. 

i just came home from having to put my dog Earl down. heâ€™s super old and was slowing down in the last six months but i just thought we had more time together. feels like it came out of nowhere. i miss him so fucking much already i feel so empty. i feel like im in shock it all progressed so quickly today.

it was definitely the right decision. on the way to the vet he was so upset and anxious and uncomfortable, panting a lot, and was feeling so bad about peeing in my car bc he couldnâ€™t help it, and i just kept talking to him and rubbing his ears and telling him what a good boy he is. he acts the same at the vet and we deliberate for an hour and a half before deciding to put him to sleep. when he comes back to the exam room after they put in the IV port thing on his paw, heâ€™s stopped panting, heâ€™s completely calm, and he lays down in front of me and just seemed so peaceful and calm. itâ€™s like he knew, and i know that sounds ridiculous but itâ€™s true. he took away any doubt in my mind that this was the right decision, he was just tired and ready to go to sleep.

i kept up a brave face for Earl this whole time but once the vet confirmed his heart had stopped i just felt like a huge piece of me died too. i stayed with his body for an hour and it was the hardest thing to leave him there for the vet to cremate his body.

i feel like my chest is caved in. Earl saved my life, and i feel so fucking guilty i couldnâ€™t do the same and fix him. there was literally nothing else i could have done and i still feel this overwhelming guilt like i let him down and i canâ€™t breathe. 

he was the best boy in the world. the gentlest soul, never hurt a fly, he loved cats and bunnies and other dogs and people  especially little kids bc he loves when someone chases him and kids never run out of energy for that. he was obsessed with every food but especially croissants and peanut butter. he was the loudest snorer he sounded like a grown ass man snoring in his bed every night, and heâ€™d sleep-bark a lot when he was dreaming. 

i miss him."

I'll be forced to go back home and stay there... I'll probably die. I know my mind won't be able to take it. It's been a crescendo. I'm tired to feel sick and tired and anxious all the time.

CPTSD,When a mis-diagnosis adds to your trauma...,"  
This is me coming back to the top to say.. I am so sorry that this is so long.. wow. I did not mean to make this so long! Also I had no idea what flair to use! .. Thank you if you made it to the end!   

A little background -- Back in 1998 when I was first diagnosed with PTSD I was also diagnosed with BPD and other things. Now I had no idea what BPD was and neither did my husband at that time. Back in those days the internet hadn't been public for very long. I think my husband's mother first got the internet in her house in 1996. We were living with the husbands family at that time as well and had a son who was just a baby (born Aug 1997). I didn't have my first break down until 4 months after he was born. That is another story for another time. I ended up in the psych hospital right around the start of the new year 1998 for the first time due to this breakdown and the situation that caused it.  I was in and out of the hospital several times in the next 8 months then again several more times in the next couple years.  It was summer 1998 that my social worker at the hospital told me about disability for my chronic ptsd, nightmares, and all the other horrible things I was going through at the time and with her help I got sign up and accepted onto SSI.   

That was a big intro there but this post is mostly about the BPD. When I told my husband what they said I had, well ptsd made sense because I was horribly abused all my life growing up and I literally got married to get away from the abuse in the super religious family. (Not recommended!)  But neither of us had even heard about BPD or what it meant. My husband went to the internet to try to look up stuff about it.  But he got dragged down a rabbit hole and eventually fall into a chat group with other men, husbands, to women with BPD.  The next thing I knew I was the villain. These husbands told horror story after horror story about women with BDP. Things their wife's supposedly did to them because of this disorder.    

I would like to think that now that I am in my mid 40's that BPD is not as widely known as the curse DX.  Back then everything you read was how no therapist would work with you, how BPD women (it seemed women were the only ones Dxd with it back in those days) .. are very manipulative.  How they will use your kids against you, they will give the BPD as well if the kids hang around you too much. He started not letting me around my own son (and eventually my daughter as well who was born in April 1999) .. Ever thing out of my mouth was ""my BPD"" .. every I did and said was because of BPD. There was a new book that came out called Walking on Eggshells in 1998 that became the Bible in that men's group.  They would sit around in chats almost all day just talking about their horrible wife's or horrible ex's   

It got to the point where i was the one walking on eggshells. I did my own research in those days and everything I found did make it out to sound like BPD was the devils curse and you can't trust a person with BPD with anything.  My ex started cheating on me saying being with me was too hard for him and he needed to be able to go out with his ""friends"" (who turned out to be a female friend) to get a break from .. well from me.. and my BPD.  I was not just his wife or just me anymore i was ""me plus BDP""  everything  out of his mouth was about it. I truly did not really believe I had it based on the criteria of it at the time. I didn't think most the things fit me. Sure some did because some things fall under PTSD and other things as well.   
  
I only stayed with him for 4 years before getting a divorce and there was a lot more domestic abuse happening above and beyond BPD accusations. It was when he nonchalantly told me that he cheated on me.  I was in therapy at the time .. having to take my toddler and baby with me because he was out so much with ""friends"" and his mother who took his side on most everything worked a lot so they suddenly stopped worrying about ""BPD me"" with my own kids.   

I left him .. after a huge domestic fight with both him AND his mother .. I took the kids with me but they got an emergency order to come to the domestic abuse facility and take them from me claiming ""she was abused all her life and she has BPD we have to get those kids away from her: and the F-ing judge .. agreed. Agreed that a person with abuse history will hurt their own kids .. and women with BPD are dangerous.  This is followed by years of court me trying to get my kids back .. until i stop trying because my poor son was old enough to get effected by this ""back and forth"" thing. Him and his very sudden new wife (the cheater husband/wife duo here) ended up getting custody and iw as the the ""visiting parent"" because I was abused and that stupid male judge took the fathers side so much and I was the villain because ""they were afraid I would beat my kids cus I was abused"" (sorry still bitter about this and it's been years)   

IT was several years later that my new therapist told me that she in no way thinks I have BPD nor had it before and that back in those days .. they handed BPD out like candy -- especially to women. Now I do not want anyone to think that I think BPD is this horrible thing. I never believed I was this horrible person that my husband and his friends were making me out to be. I know I had issues, I know I had/have severe ptsd (cPTSD was unofficially added by my current therapist as my abuse went on most of my life and well into adulthood as well) ..I know i had depression and anxiety and I know i have ""some things that fall under BPD"" I just never believed I was nearly ""as bad"" as these stories my husband would tell me that he got from those other men. I don't know if those stories they told were true or exaggerated either i just know that I didn't think I fit under that umbrella they made up. 
  
I think that BPD and therapy has come a long way since those days -- least I hope so!! I know that some people still think it's horrible and I don't understand why. People get these things because of trauma. I don't think it is fair to blame the person who got BPD because of how they were raised.  I don't think it is fair to make that an entire identity and forget about the abuse and all other things the person went through .. that made them fall under the BPD umbrella -- the real umbrella not the horrible one those men and my husband made .. their umbrella was too much.. too far .. it added more trauma to my already long list.   

I lost my family .. I lost custody of my kids (i got custody back unofficially because I never went through the courts .. I will say again.. Another long story for another time!)  when they were in middle school because husband and new wife (the one he cheated on me with) .. abandoned them at his father's house and after his father took care of them for 6 months and he didn't see his son.. my ex-husband ever.. The grandfather called me to get them saying he already raised his kids and he didnâ€™t want to do it again. Understandable. His wife (the kids grandmother had already passed from an aneurism) and it's not fair to expect your widowed father to raise your kids alone while your off partying etc! (That is what my ex was doing.. They both were off getting high and stealing from people to keep getting high  -- again that is another story for another time)   

.. so I did, I went and got them. I raised them -- they are in their 20's now and i hear compliments about how nice they are and how i did well raising them and neither one of them have BPD ... (my husband used to say that i would give it to them because i guess it can be passed on like the plague \*shrugs\*) .. In the end .. I  do not have BPD nor did i ever have it .. but that is the Dx that ruined my family .. (along with other issues not mentioned but it was one of the big things that contributed)   
I guess the thing i want to say most is that having BPD is not a bad thing. I hope they are further along now days to know that it's not your fault if you have it and it's not the devils curse and you deserve proper treatment.  And if you ever think that you are dx'd wrong about anything.. speak up .. you have a right to say ""i know i might have this and that but i don't have these other 4 criteria so i don't think it fits me.""  And you have a right to second opinions and 3rd and 4th.   

I hope this doesn't come off as anything bad to anyone. It is just me sharing my own personal story and I do not nor would i ever judge anyone who does have BPD. I will say again that I do not think it is the devils curse and i would definitely be friends with anyone .. whether they have it or not.  That was a big thing back when I was in my 20s .. no therapist wanted to work with me .. and once people heard i had BPD -- from the husband .. I lost friends and couldn't make new ones.   

That book ""Stop Walking On Eggshells"" has a byline that says ""Taking Your Life Back When someone you love has borderline personality disorder""  .. just the title alone makes it sound like people with BPD are horrible people .. and the men (or family)  with it need to ""take their life back"".. because we somehow .. ruined it?? I never read the book because it was being used against me for so long and i was afraid to see what it actually said. Maybe it is a good book for people who use it as it was intended but for me its a trigger .. I was the one walking around on eggshells around my husband ... because i couldn't live, breathe or be me.. without adding ""BPD"" after my name, all of my thoughts, all of my actions .. everything i said and did was ""because i had bpd"" .. he said .. and if we argued he said  ""oh that just your bpd saying that"" .. if i  get upset or sad ""you are just manipulating me with your bpd"" .. etc etc I wasn't allowed to feel real human things because its was me somehow manipulating him .. all the time.. every time  

BPD is a real thing, I know it is a real thing. But you are not a horrible person if you have it. It is not your identity. You deserve love, care, compassion, and help just as much as anyone else does for any other mental health issue. 
  
That is all and thank you so much for getting this far .."
CPTSD,Is it possible to recover from prolonged neglect?,"Hi, this is going to be long and I dont know what I'm going to get out of it other than knowing I've vocalised it somewhere.Tldr at the end. I am a hopeless 33 year old male who has never had a relationship and has never had a job higher than minimum wage.

I feel like an utter failure and coming to terms with childhood neglect to heal and recognise the cause of my shortcomings.

My parents were hoarders, substance abusers and gambling addicts but maintained just the right level of social consciousness to pass any of the numerous social services visits.

They would sleep all day 2 or 3 times a week when on a comedown or when they had run out of money for drugs. 

My mother suffered form depression and wouldn't cook or clean or do anything but sleep. We lived in filthy conditions and my dad would blame us (me and my 3 sisters) 
We had a reputation as the family of  ""tramps"" (homeless person in the uk.) 
Adults would smile at me and my sisters and then tell their children to stay away from us to avoid getting head lice. 

From the ages of 11-16 I was perpetually hungry.  Some days I would get so irritable from it that I would cry with rage. I couldn't focus at school and skipped school 30% of the time.


We would wash once a week, and I could count the amount of times I brushed my teeth for the first 15 years of my life on my fingers. I would go to school with dirty unform that smelt of stale cigarettes and adults would hold their noses when near me or say a comment to another adult thinking (as adults often do) that I'm a child and therefore incapable of comprehending what they are saying right in front of me.

I went to 5 different schools by the time I was 16 (2 is the norm in this country.) 
Our family was evicted from our first home when I was 9 because my parents defaulted on their rent. We spent a few nights in hostels and with relatives then we broke into our old flat and my parents told us to lay low. I remember them even saying it's like we're the borrowers. We can live there for a while but we can't be seen.

I was also 9 when I was expected to take my 6 year old sister to school which was 30 minutes walk down a motorway. We were told to tell teachers that we were dropped off just outside the gate. This was just one of many lies we told on behalf or our parents.

The following is not neglect but certainly added a strain on my mental health. I was 14 when I was outed as gay by a friend I confided in. At first my mates pretended they were cool with it but they slowly started distancing themselves from me when they'd tease each other by making kissing faces whenever one of them would talk to me. From 14-16 I had extremely limited contact with anyone. This severe isolation messed with my mental health so badly that I really can't remember much from those years.

TL;DR
 I want to know if it's possible to overcome decades of negative mental health states? What is the best way to process and deal with it? 

I've tried to accept that I will never amount to anything and that I should look to philosophies like Minimalism, Buddhism and Stoicism that emphasise being happy with less or achieving a state of peace in the mind.

Has anybody else gone through anything similar, and could you spare any advice? "
CPTSD,What Are Your Hobbies?,"I struggle because I don't feel like I have much. I have interests, but nothing that I necessarily *do*, if that makes sense. I go through certain phases where I engross myself in certain things, and kind of go all out. For example, about 6 or 7 years ago or so, I was really into Game of Thrones and the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series in general. I wanted to know everything I possibly could about that world. A couple years later, I was on a VERY big Beach Boys kick, and delved into that realm. After that, I think my next obsession was Mortal Kombat. Now I'm very into Dragon Ball Z. I've dabbled in a few different languages as well... Spanish, German, and Koine Greek... A little Hebrew...  


I used to play a little guitar, but right now, I don't have the patience to relearn what I've lost. Same with drawing and sculpting. I used to be great, but I've lost my patience for all of it and now I'm nowhere near what I was.  


I'm a Christian and love to research the Historic Christian Faith, but I'm earning a doctorate in ministry, so at this point, it's nothing I do for fun. Aside from that, it's also my job.  


So I realize that I don't really have any hobbies, and there's something about me that doesn't really desire adding anything else to my plate, but on the other hand, I do very little for myself.  


In the summer, I garden... But other than that... I feel boring.   


What do you do that interests you? I'd love to know because I'd like some ideas for myself."
CPTSD,[Females only] [Sexual Assualt TW] How do you make gyn exams less traumatic?,"Hey I had an exam today & it was awful. I cannot not have a panic attack. At least my nurse midwife was somewhat understanding. I avoid these exams like the plague though. It's a degrading & painful experience. It triggers my thinking of I'm a subhuman being & piece of trash. (I know that's not true logically but my feelings say otherwise)

Most of my ptsd comes from not feeling safe at home & at school when I was younger. Bullied endlessly with no counter weight of love & acceptance. I was potentially sexually assaulted in my late 20s. I say potentially because when I use to talk about it some people have told me no & some yes. Basically, someone I thought I was in love with got on top of me unexpectantly & when I said no a bunch of times. He continued but I finally said yes & than he proceeded. I was soo emotionally unmature so that just seems really wrong. I'm not sure if that plays a part in what goes through my mind in the exam room. I JUST HATE IT."
CPTSD,Intensive therapy worth it?,"I still deal with flashbacks daily, social anxiety, depression, etc. But my CPTSD isn't nearly as bad as it was a few years ago where I often contemplated suicide, was painfully shy and could barely speak to anyone, had intense rage multiple times per day due to flashbacks, etc

I still want to heal from CPTSD asap and I have the money for it, so I was thinking about intensive therapy. But none of my past therapists or current one have ever recommended it to me, but I never asked them about it

Anyone here with experience with intensive sessions treating CPTSD? Are they worth it for someone like me? Are there any that take no more than a few hours per day so that I way I can continue working my full-time job? Or ask my current therapist to do multiple sessions per week?"
CPTSD,Everything that is supposed to help just makes things worse,#NAME?
CPTSD,feel like i canâ€™t relate to anyone [ADVICE WANTED],"even ppl with cptsd always talk about wanting to be loved and feeling lonely and fears of abandonment but i cant relate to anything like that. i actively wish the people who love me would stop, itâ€™s so smothering and suffocating and awful. i rarely feel lonely, i never have any kind of drive to need people or want people. iâ€™ve never felt better around people, so why be around them. i donâ€™t have any kind of fear of abandonment, i WANT to be abandoned, i want to be forgotten by people, my greatest wish is to be completely alone (but im diagnosed w bpd?? which is rly weird to me ðŸ˜­). i donâ€™t want to ever know anyone and i donâ€™t want anyone to ever know me, even if it ends up being bad for me and i have no support system. i fantasize about a life where the only connections i have to others is small talk at the grocery store. i think id feel so free and safe and comfortable. i hate relationships they feel so â€œviolentâ€ and unsafe, even the ones ive enjoyed the most. obviously the reason i feel this way is because of trauma and if i could believe in people id probably feel differently. like in theory relationships (all types) seem cool and fun and love seems beautiful but in practice ive never experienced anything positive in relationships. ive never really loved someone. like i want to want relationships but i hate them. i feel guilty too because i cant reciprocate love for anyone. i just dont care, and lots of times id prefer if people didnâ€™t love me. this doesnâ€™t really exist in a vacuum though, like sometimes i do feel like i want to rely on people but no one is reliable. however, generally, i have no desire to be loved and no desire to be cared about. i feel so outcast even in my own communities because most people seem to have opposite fears and opposite desires. 

can anyone relate to this? if you relate to this and ur comfortable what was ur childhood like? does anyone know what this could be/come from? is this something that can be fixed or worked on? has anyone overcome this? is it even something that needs to be worked on? for me it is agonizing, but only because iâ€™m told i *should* want relationships and i get like fomo."
CPTSD,Executive Dysfunction & Exercise,"Hey guys. I'm new to learning about CPTSD and I really need some words of comfort, advice, and/or resources. 

I used to be very active and I'm fully aware how much exercising does for my mental and emotional health. Like when I'm down, I KNOW that is part of the solution. Problem is, the last six months or so I've completely lost the ability to force myself to do it (which I've now identified as executive dysfunction). 

Working out is not the only thing I experience this with but it takes the biggest toll on my health. My self image and self esteem are especially low since I've lost so much muscle and just feel weak and lethargic all the time. I also learned I'm autistic recently if that is useful context.

What can I do? Does anyone else go through this? I'm beyond exhausted of feeling this way."
CPTSD,do you have an unalive note prepared?,"I've got one, and got my friend to know where it is and what to do with it. 

if something happens/ I happen to make it happen, I want my message to be left behind."
CPTSD,How much of our issues are caused by trauma and how much of it is genetically inherited from mentally ill parents?,"My dad blames all his faults on other people. He straight up told me that HE didn't abuse me, it was the alcohol's fault and not the real him, and that he drank because he was in an unhappy marriage so it was really my mom's fault. I feel myself have the same toxic defensive issues, something wasn't MY fault, it was my parents' fault for giving me such a fucked up upbringing. But a part of me feels like I inherited whatever crazy my parents have and I am just genetic trash, that my issues weren't simply caused by trauma. That if I were to have kids, they would be fucked up like me."
CPTSD,CPTSD and ASD?,"I wonder if someone here has some thoughts on and/or experiences with cPTSD and ASD (in females). 

I recently was diagnosed with cPTSD (30, f). I, myself, think about autism quite often. Took some tests, did some self reflection and healing on my trauma in therapy.
I asked my therapist, if we could test for ASD, but she said: â€šWith complex trauma we wonâ€˜t be able to figure out if the symptoms result from trauma or ASD.â€˜

I donâ€˜t feel comfortable with the answer: cause why not test it and then say â€šnot able to tellâ€˜ rather than â€šnah, we canâ€˜t and donâ€˜t even tryâ€˜.

Also a problem: I have no one to evaluate my childhood, cause no contact with mother due to abuse and no other family rather than younger brother.

Context: living in Germany. And I feel to anxious to ask for diagnostic tests (again)."
CPTSD,Sad and ashamed of my wasted life,"Today I'm just sad, even though I should be happy. 

I got a job, but a I can think about is worry I won't keep it for a long time. 

I feel like everyone else in my life is going forward and Im stuck in this stupid, immature and anxious state, completely unable to connect with others. 

Loneliness hits hard. 


All i want in 2024 to happen is to be free, social and finally feel safe. 

Nothing more. 

Share your own wishes for this year if u want."
CPTSD,Feeling tired,"I have been off work since December 8th, but in that time my grandad passed and it was Christmas and new year. 

New year without my ex who caused me to have this was so hard. I came home, i need to look for a new job, but everything feels shit. I say in front of a screen today for two hours. Nothing. 

My trauma responses are extreme. I called my dad and cried for 40 minutes this morning because my boiler is broken. I can't take the decisions I have to take to get it fixed. 

I just feel terrified. All the fucking time. And disconnected. I called the doctor. They won't see me until the 24th."
CPTSD,My family is abusive and crazy,"I hear all time that family is most important and how I should listen to family when my family is abusive and not normal.

Dad molested me as ''joke'' almost 2 years ago and I was gaslighted. My mom sa-ed me year ago and I was also gaslighted and victim blamed about that. They wanted me to go to psychologist for having such thoughts. Sister said ''the fact that you still remember that'' theyâ€™re all against me 

I called lawyer and they were mad cause telling lawyer mom kissed me on chest is embarrassing as my family said and lawyer would grape me how dad said because I was talking to lgbt people on Facebook who gave me that number 

This happened in 11 December. Mom threatened with police on theoretical lgbt guys who she called satanists and pedos because I changed name I Facebook (Iâ€™m trans boy) I called police and they drove me to police building. I signed warning so she wouldnâ€™t take me to psychologist. 

I was there for hours and my family was mad at me again. Parents and grandpa came, they talked with police and told that guy I was acting like that because i stayed at grandparents for 2 year when there was Covid and didnâ€™t have real life friends 

When they left that man asked if I love parents because they love me. I told him that dad touched my genitalia cause he thought thatâ€™s funny and man said ''people are individuals with different personalities'' and he asked â€˜â€™you know how you are looking?'' Of course I would look nervous 

In car dad said that lawyer would pretend to be police and grape me. They blamed lgbt people for trying to ruin family by making me send mom to jail. I wasnâ€™t sending her to jail. I called lawyer for advice cause theyâ€™re insane. 

Mom told me older  sister knew about my accounts and saw awful comments. Awful comments were comments by people on post on Reddit about my mom sa-ing me

I got home and my sister started being transphobic and blaming me again. 

''See how you scared you are? Your eyes are black'' she said that trans people I had on Facebook would make me a sex worker. There are trans people who canâ€™t have other job but that doesnâ€™t mean she cares about me. She said Americans called what my mom did covert incest because they watch p*rn and joke about Alabama 

She said she had been seeing for last 10 days how I was stabbing myself in her dreams. ''Have ever thought universe is talking through people? What if me talking is universe taking to you?'' She thinks she spiritual when she is controlling 

She made fun of my names I had online. I had different names because I thought if she found one account she wouldnâ€™t find other account with that name. I realised she had been stalking for long time 

No my mom is more controlling and scared of me texting that people again. She blames heavy music and makes me wear clean nail polish. I have to wait some years so I can be free from them. Itâ€™s crazy "
CPTSD,Just met my abusers therapist,My mum is friends with my exâ€™s therapist. Theyâ€™re work colleagues at a local school and they lift share. The therapist drove them into work today. I was travelling back to my hometown so they picked me up from the train station. Felt weird to be sat so close to the only person who could have known how sick and damaged he was. I hate to say it but I canâ€™t help but resent her even though sheâ€™s a lovely woman. She was seeing him for 4 years before we were together and for the first year of our relationship. She could have told my mum to be weary of him being around me.
CPTSD,DAE spiraling down emotions heavily?,"Dear community,

I have these feelings about 1 to 7 times a week, last from 1 to 5 hours.

It starts with some feelings in my body, like increased heart rate, bowel movement, being cold or anything else, then intrusive thoughts start like ""no, it starts again"" ""I can do nothing against it"" ""nobody can help me"" ""I will forever feel miserable"", ""I am a hopeless case"", ""I will never have a good life"", ""only way out is >!suidide!<""
Combined with heavy feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, being isolated, desperate and anxiety. My body of course also reacts, with freeze, shivering/shaking, being tensed up.

And these situations somehow are a self-fulfilling prophecy, as when I keep heaving these breakdowns, I will not be able to have a job or whatever, so as long as they are there, these thoughts are aomehow right, so it is really hard for me, to fight against it.

Anyone else having similar symptoms and / or strategies to handle them?"
CPTSD,Trauma therapy/self help?,"Extra trigger warning later on: past self harm (marked at beginning of paragraph)

Hi everyone, just joined the group today after some memories surfaced quite randomly/after thinking over the last few months. I'm 25F, UK. I live with type one diabetes and have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, just to briefly start.

I was terrified growing up because I didn't ever have money as an emergency if I had to buy food and also have a very restricted medical diet just to complicate matters. My mam received dla on my behalf but I never received any of it directly, she must have used it to house me etc. 

A couple of problems holding me back now, I suspect to stem from some really horrific experiences I had (medical trauma?) Growing up as someone with undiagnosed adhd and autism, being type one diabetic and having coeliac. 

I never dare ask for help when I need it these days which is quite often, even when it's life or death: I had several seizures believed to have been caused by my low blood sugars and not waking up to them/having to walk down stairs to get treatment. One of the times that I was borderline passed out times was in public with my auntie. When I tried to explain what was going on (slurring my words) she snapped at me and told me to wait. I lost the ability to keep standing and also lost my vision (I'd describe it as that migraine fuzzy distorted vision loss). She told me i was dramatic and demanding and that I only had to wait, dragged me up and demanding I started walking again -I couldn't. 

On a school trip, I had one in front of all my class mates during the night. My teacher at the time got me to walk downstairs and I couldn't eat because i felt so sick but my body was shutting down on me and i just remember saying I needed to sleep and kept almost drifting off. He made me try to walk up 5 flights of stairs but i kept falling and crawling and had to stop eventually because again, I couldn't see. We informed the place i was staying i was coeliac but the just took items off rather than substitute so I didn't eat enough carbs. I was too traumatised to advocate for myself however and experienced shutdown due to the autism. The teacher rang my parent first of all, instead of an ambulance, who demanding he didn't ring an ambulance and said she was coming to pick me up (2 hour drive). Meanwhile I was refusing to eat because I felt I was going to be sick. They were furious with me when they arrived for not eating more snacks the night before, like the cereal bars I'd been sent away with.

Similarly in college, I had a lecturer furious with me because I chose to treat a hypo in class discretely, as opposed to walking down 4 flights of about 15 stairs and going to the canteen, despite me bravely explaining despite being traumatised because I was being ridiculed and scolded for eating for medical reasons and the whole class was staring at me/laughing.

* self harm warning* : When my mam and step dad found out about my self harm they were enraged and thought i was ungrateful for everything they did to put a roof over my head and provide for me, and criticised me for doing something so ""silly and upsetting"", threatened to take away my privacy and did and so on. 

I used to be called selfish for needing to hide in my room whenever family was round and I couldn't be surrounded by all the loud voices at once and so many people and not knowing what to say etc. 

I was told I was lazy and careless and just not putting in the work from the diabetic clinic I was with, was constantly met with judgement and criticism and was threatening either hospitalisation/them showing me someone who hadn't looked after their blood sugars well. I was told I had potential I just wasn't meeting by school, was told I would never cope as an adult if I had meltdowns over tiny things, so on. 

So sorry for the detail, but I just wondering if anyone knows of a specific UK therapist/who to get in touch with to try and be signposted if not,who specialises in these sorts of themes (medical trauma/growing up with undiagnosed ADHD and autism and the trauma this can cause or has caused in my case. 

Thank you so much if you read this far. Forgot to mention I have some savings and Im considering private if I can afford it"
CPTSD,Anyone else suspect they have autism/are diagnosed? What are your experiences?,"I'm thinking of getting evaluated for it, genuinely. My therapist says I was traumatized and isolated from such a young age that it caused me to develop a lot of similar symptoms. I have all the common comorbid conditions, many symptoms that can't be explained by my cptsd that have been lifelong, and I think finding out for sure would help me understand a lot more of my trauma and how to heal and move on bc I don't think what I'm doing is working. Anyone diagnosed who can share how autism affected your trauma and recovery?"
CPTSD,I have no idea if Im grieving what could have been without CPTSD or have a sense of entitlement,"I am middleaged. And Im still struggling to come to terms with the fact that I didnt amount to much at all. I blame lack of help, lack of recogniton from previous therapists. I just finished a weird therapy-relation where I found myself behaving (or at least imagining my therapist thinking I was) a superentitled person. The thing is I grew up believing I was a smart person. I cant reconcile the person I was as a very promising kid with how I have ended up. And I have no idea if Im super-entitled or legitimately grieving. Im considering going to a therapist to ask if I may be a narcisist? I also feel a lot of resentment towards therapists because they usually come from a much better background than I do. I am so confused. I used to think of myself, and come off as levelheaded but traumatized person. This latest therapy-relation brought out a lot of weird reactions that I dont really recognize in my self at all. I used to be all about self-improvement, but lately Ive just blamed lack of help while at my worst."
CPTSD,My sister stays in contact with people who have abused me,"What would you guys do if you had a sister who always befriended your abusers/rapists. My sister literally will go out of her way to befriend people that Iâ€™ve had issues with. I donâ€™t understand wtf to do. Iâ€™ve confronted her about it and every time I do she has a bunch of stupid shit to say. Sheâ€™s so kind and friendly to my abusers and men who have raped me. 

Thereâ€™s one girl in particular that I asked my sister why do you still follow her after knowing what happened and she said I can unfollow her and still days later hasnâ€™tâ€¦ I told her how it made me feel and she told me again that she can unfollow herâ€¦ she obviously doesnâ€™t want to.. it may sound petty but Iâ€™m just tired of her expecting me to disown everyone she has an issue with over something superficial and I will for her no questions asked but she wonâ€™t do anything like that for meâ€¦."
CPTSD,Ever feel like you have imposter syndrome?,"I find myself feeling like I donâ€™t even believe myself sometimes. Telling myself, â€œoh it wasnâ€™t that bad, Iâ€™m being overly sensitive or emotional.â€ Or feel like Iâ€™m faking trauma or giving myself trauma because Iâ€™m being overly sensitive. I know that not how it works but I hate when I feel this way. I gaslight myself and drive myself crazy."
CPTSD,Struggles with sexuality. (long post),"I'm not an SA victim. Nobody molested me. 

But sexuality has still been a very difficult thing for me. I'd like to give voice to my struggles and hopefully find (and provide) some validation.

----

***Religion, Part 1***

When I was young I was highly compliant and I trusted the adults in my life *way* too much. The adults gave me a book called The Bible and told me it was the word of God. I took this *super* seriously, which became a real problem. In Matthew 5:27-28 it says that ""any man who looks at a woman with lust in his heart has committed adultery.""

And then I hit puberty. And I *hated* myself.

----

***Religion, Part 2***

There are many layers to this. For one thing, my religious feelings were actually pretty mild in my earlier years, and I wasn't raised fundamentalist. My parents didn't scream about Being A Good Christian or anything like that. I wasn't forcefully reminded that hellfire awaited me if I sinned.

But around the age of 12, I got involved in Youth Group at church.

At this point you're probably thinking ""Oh, so you had a terrible, fundamentalist youth group!"" But I *didn't*! Certainly not in the way most people would picture it, anyway. Our youth pastor was incredibly warm, playful and approachable. I connected with him like no other adult I knew. He never abused me and I never heard a direct accusation of him abusing anyone else.

This warm, empathetic man just...believed in the Bible. Believed in it absolutely. And I followed his example. I truly, truly believed.

He ended up moving away before puberty really hit me. Maybe if he'd been around he would've told me not to hate myself so much. I don't know exactly. He'd probably be the type to say ""Well, God forgives you"" while still maintaining that the Bible was literally true and therefore, yes, technically I *had* committed adultery by having sexual thoughts. And that still would've crushed me.

In any case, I was only my own with only the Bible to guide me, and the Bible was very clear, and I *hated* myself.

----

***Parents***

And there are more threads beyond that, of course. When I awkwardly asked my parents about masturbation, they gave me what I assume is the standard awkward speech that parents give to their children, which was basically ""This is socially taboo but we don't exactly hate you for it. Pay attention to what they teach you in health class.""

So again, not a fundamentalist thing at all. But I could see that they were uncomfortable, and I was *highly* sensitive to their feelings, and anyway the Bible said that I was wrong just for *thinking* things, let alone *doing* things...

And there were more layers too. I'd long since learned to suppress my own thoughts and emotions, to conform to what other people wanted from me. Sexual thoughts were so powerful that they *scared* me. It felt like mind control, and I doubled down on self-control to keep the thoughts at bay.

----

***Scrupulosity***

Then there was my extreme scrupulosity. When I struggled with sexuality in my teenage years, I constantly reminded myself of all the women in the world who felt objectified and how some of them developed anorexia just to maximize their sexuality. I felt *extremely* guilty for contributing to these problems in any way.

So I started digging my nails into my skin whenever I had sexual thoughts. I started screaming at myself in my own head, night after night. I thought that this discipline was highly moral on my part. I had no idea it was highly self-destructive.

----

***Stress***

*Another* layer to this is that I was extremely stressed out about grades, which is where my parents put their focus. Good Grades were necessary for a Good Life, in their view. (Ironically the pursuit of good grades led me to a nervous breakdown and I've had a *bad* life as a result...) I was *also* stressed by such things as my younger siblings fighting and it was my job to deal with them because my parents were neglectful and I was parentified.

My point is, since I was already so stressed, and since sexuality can serve to reduce stress, my sexual feelings were probably even *stronger* than they normally are for a teenager.

----

***Culture***

I cannot describe the incredible amount of pain and shame I endured, trying to suppress my sexuality.

It didn't help that I had zero healthy role models for sexuality. As a culture, this isn't something that we want to talk about.

And if anyone discusses sexuality with a *teenager*, that's considered a sign of pedophilia. And yes, there are pedophiles out there! There are abusers! I know! But there are also self-hating kids like me who need someone to tell them that it's ok to have sexual fantasies so long as you aren't hurting anyone. The best info I ever got was how to avoid STDs; nobody ever taught me how to handle the emotional side of things. Nobody had anything to say about how sexuality can be an expression of your personality, as opposed to being this weird alien mind control thing that makes people feel awkward and gives you STDs and causes girls to have anorexia and makes God disappointed in you and every other bad thing under the sun.

----

***Time***

It's been a couple of decades, and I'm still a virgin, and honestly that hurts. And it also hurts to know that if I say ""I'm male and I'm a virgin"" there's a certain group of people who will just *assume* that I'm a Misogynistic Asshole Who Only Thinks Of Women As Objects.

At my local library, I once saw a book on the shelf called ""All Men Are Jerks (Until Proven Otherwise)."" That hurt me.

I told a friend about my struggles in finding a date, and she said ""Just please tell me you won't become one of those incels"". That hurt. (Imagine if you told a friend that you had financial struggles, and she said ""Just please tell me that you won't start robbing banks"".)

I'm not religious anymore, but I'm highly sensitive to the idea that women are secretly afraid of me and they're just too polite to say so. That terrifies me, and it makes it hard to approach anyone.

Dating sites get me nowhere, perhaps because I don't have the emotional stamina to get dozens of rejections so I quickly stop trying.

Recently I told a new friend how I'm still a virgin at this age, and he suggested that I'm asexual. HA. I wish. The fact is that sexuality is important to me, and I know now that it can be a fun, tender and loving thing. But I have no idea where to find a partner, and my therapists have never known either.

***Struggles***

I'd actually be interested in hiring a Sexual Surrogate if possible. These people are essentially therapist/prostitutes; they help the client deal with their emotions around sex and that includes actually having sex with them when the time is right. But the legality of Sexual Surrogates is dubious where I live, and there aren't any anywhere near me.

And I can't just find a regular prostitute on the black market, because that industry is full of abuse and I do *not* want to participate in that.

Of course I could just get a girlfriend, right?? Except I don't know how. Everybody just says ""Try a dating site!"" and ""Do activities!"" and ""Just be yourself! and I've been *trying* all that as best I can for a decade now with little success. I had one relationship that lasted a couple years until she broke up with me. She was too shy for sex, and I never pushed her, never expressed any resentment about it. Honestly I was glad just to go on dates and cuddle now and then.

But she left me eventually, she said I hadn't done anything wrong, I was just not the right fit for her personally. I accepted that. We agreed to just be friends.

And then later, I spoke to a girl my age in a public place, and that girl smiled and said something nice in return and then walked away. I wondered ""Could I have kept talking to that girl?"" My (female) therapist said yes, but my ex gave me a hard no. When I tried to press the point and said my therapist disagreed with her, my ex said I sounded like some sort of incel and she ended our friendship permanently.

I'm hurt. And I'm very scared that this is *never* going to work out for me.

...I'm also scared that somebody is going to yell at me in the comments, saying that I'm not a woman and I don't understand the pain of women and therefore my pain is invalid and I'm probably some sort of Misogynist Asshole Who Treats Women Like Objects.

I found these essays validating:

***Conclusion***

People tell me that I'm worthy of love. And that's the main thing I want: love. But it's not sinful to want sex too, is it? Can't sex be a positive, loving experience? Aren't I worthy of that too? Is ok for me to have these desires?

All these years later, and I'm still struggling. =("
CPTSD,"I really hate people who canâ€™t respect boundaries, canâ€™t find fault in themselves, constantly deflect criticism, and victim-blame","A: YOU have to do this, YOU have to do this, YOU need to improve here, YOU shouldnâ€™t do this, etc

B: Okay, but I see that you do the same thing. Why are you criticizing me for doing the same thing youâ€™re doing?

A: YOU have to do this, YOU have to do this, this is where YOUâ€™re wrong at, etc (A is not recognizing his/her own faults)

B: okay, my bad, I had \*insert thought\* in mind when I did it. Itâ€™s my fault. Anyways, about you doing the same thing youâ€™re criticizing me ofâ€¦

CPTSD,What are the barriers to your healing?,"I'm sat here after 3 years of therapy. I've come far, some people would say. I don't have inpatient stays anymore and my crisis are less frequent. 

 But I still struggle immensely...  every winter is the same downward spiral.  I still have crises and ODs in winter.  I still live quality of life heavily weighed down by CPTSD 24/7/365.    Still can't work or have a family of my own or get out bed. 

I keep thinking.   Why am I still in this position,  where am I going wrong?  I keep telling myself,  its up to me to make myself better,  ive got to do the work. I have to hold hope.  I have to be more positive. 

  So What is going wrong?? Where am I going wrong?? 

I wanted to see what other people's barriers are to healing...?  What holds you guys back?    maybe something will resonate."
CPTSD,What is the point of lifeâ€¦,"I know this is a huge question but bear with me.

Iâ€™ve lived in pain and then in numbness. Now Iâ€™m back again not in either state.  But everytime I think about what Iâ€™m here for what meaning I get out of life Iâ€™m truly at a loss.

Iâ€™ve seen people argue itâ€™s for doing the most we can and feeling the most fun. But thatâ€™s not satisfying, thatâ€™s basically donâ€™t think about it too much just live love laugh. Iâ€™m in a genuine state of crisis where whenever I look at my life down the line I genuinely donâ€™t get the point of anything living having kids working, we all die and dissipate into nothing. Why not cut the suffering short if this is the case, becuase realistically life is a lot more suffering than it is joy at least to me. Joy is just a rare moment in a passing month. 

Why should I keep fighting to live, and try. What is there even to try for. Something completely meaningless like the happiness of a weekend. Nothing actually means anything. After being so long dissociated I understand that everything we feel and think of is just made up. None of this actually means anything. 

I feel so terrible and hopeless about life and what Iâ€™m here for. How do I get out of thisâ€¦."
CPTSD,Do you guys ever feel like the world is not meant for people like us?,"Sometimes I feel like that the world is only meant for insensitive and unempathetic people.  It's almost like as if people who live like machines with absolutely no emotions can only survive in this world. 

How are we supposed to survive, we are simultaneously paying for the consequences of our past and trying to make sense of our present. 

I know I'm sounding pessimistic and hopeless but I genuinely don't know how to make sense of all this."
CPTSD,What is the point,"Feeling so hopeless recently. I had two personal blows, a financial one and then found Iâ€™m pre-diabetic at 34, I exercise and eat pretty healthy. I also I had low iron symptoms for over a year and my old doctor blew me off with â€œanxietyâ€. Finally found out I was low iron last week thought that was all they found then had a receptionist ring me up to say Iâ€™m pre-diabetic. I have health anxiety so itâ€™s my worst nightmare finding out something is wrong. Iâ€™ve cut out all carbs etc but thatâ€™s hugely triggering as I used to be bulimic/anorexic subtype. 

Thereâ€™s a lot more to my story, but itâ€™s long and probably tedious to read. I just feel so emotionally exhausted with life, I feel like I attract negative situations by just being me. My therapist keeps saying youâ€™ve had a lot of bad luck, but what does that mean? Am I unlucky, sometimes I feel I am a terrible person and life is punishing me, like I must have done something awful in a past life and thatâ€™s why these things happened. 

I went to therapy today and I cried for the first time in a session which felt ok but the rest of the session ended up with me defending why I donâ€™t trust doctors very much, which I think wasted time when I wanted to focus on expressing my emotions which I struggle to do in therapy. 

I feel so alone even though people are around me. I donâ€™t feel safe in this world, or in this body at all."
CPTSD,Ive decided i'll cut off my entire family and go at it alone,"They are all abusive, emotionally unavailbable, emotionally immature. It seems im the only one in the whole family with any kind of empathy and emotional intelligence. I'm sick of being the scape goat to their shame, their guilt and playing a narrative of pretending im less than they are so they can pretend they more. I spent my whole life trying to look better, trying to be better in the hope that one day they'd treat me better, it's never happened and its exhausting, im exhausted. I put all the effort it being an obediant people pleaser to barely get crumbs in return. Life will be hard, i will be alone, but it's better to be alone than with people who make you feel alone. I have no choice but to walk away, i have no more energy to adjust in the hope they will love me in the way i deserve. Im done, it's over, im walking away for good!"
CPTSD,(TW: poor hygiene) Life is funny,"Been a while since I posted on here I've been doing better mentally 

But today just made me laugh 

This girl I wanted to talk to a couple weeks ago I found out she had a boyfriend which I respect, but today I couldn't login to my school email and he came over (the boyfriend) to help me and why did he smell bad ðŸ˜­ like deadass funky bruhðŸ«¢ smelt like fucking ðŸ§€

Getting healthier from my sexual assaults and man... it makes me realize I'm not the issue when people don't want me or play games after showing interest"
CPTSD,I can count how many times I asked for help and got help on one hand,"I'm really depressed today because things keep going wrong and I'm stressed out from being stuck at home with my abusive family. It makes me sad how clearly I can see how little I matter to people around me. It's almost like I was born an orphan with no family, people see me as just a drain on resources.

It's nice to vent and I have hope for my life somehow, but doing this all by myself is very very hard. At least if I survive and do well, I can look back at laugh at my family and cut off everyone I ever knew. I'm ready to start over"
CPTSD,Memories Are Nonchronological,"All of my little memories kind of just float around in my head, completely isolated from each other and disconnected from time and space. Is that a trauma response or just my adhd brain? 

My therapist often asks ""how old where you when this happened"" or ""what year did that happen"" and I have absolutely no forking clue.

Ive always had a problem remembering dates, like I always forget peoples birthdays unless I put a reminder in my phone, but I also dont remember any important dates from my past. Like, if you asked me what I did on my 16th birthday, I actually couldnt tell you. 

I recently talked to a bunch of other women who all remembered exactly when and where they were when they got their first period and I have zero memory of that which they all found weird. Things like this happen often and they make me feel excluded from perfectly normal conversations.

Im also bad at telling stories because I feel like my brain changed so much to protect me, that Im not sure what really happened anymore.

I often feel like I only exist in this moment and my past belongs to someone else.

Does anyone else struggle with this?"
CPTSD,How to deal with unpredictability and inconsistency (trigger) in relationships?,"I have known this guy for 7 months now, we have decided to date exclusively for since november. We struggled at the beginning of our relationship because of the mixed signals he would send me, essentially he did not know what he wanted and had just come out of a relationship (which I only found out later on, after we had a brief break because I did not want to spend time with someone whose energy is so inconsistent). We have now established boundaries around our relationship, one of them being exclusivity. Regardless, he still does something that stresses me out. We live three hours apart from each other so we always sleep over for at least two days when we see each other, which is always beautiful and intense (in a good way). Once I go home or he does, he doesn't text me or takes hours to one entire day to text me back. For example, he does not ask me how I got home or whatever else there would be to ask or to answer. We have had a lot of conflict because of mixed signals and unpredictability from his part, he knows that it is a problem for me. I just realised today how much it triggers and stresses me out. It reminds me so much of how I felt with my abusive parents, yet I know it's incomparable. But I think the fact that it's hot and cold from one second to another triggers me and to be honest, it makes me want to end things. It's like after almost every time I see him, I feel stressed and doubtful. We get along really well and I really like him a lot, but this particular thing drives me insane. I don't know if it is the unpredictability factor because of my PTSD or if I am exaggerating and self sabotaging, but I did not feel/behave like this with my ex-boyfriend who also didn't behave like the guy now. I don't know if I am overreacting by thinking about ending things. Can anyone relate or give me advice on how they handled struggling with situations like this?"
CPTSD,Working 8 night shifts in a row.,"I guess this is more of a vent, i work 8 days in a row at a hospital, and get 6 days off. Right after the 6 days off, the night i go to work i feel really depressed and unfulfilled. On days where i have work later, i can never enjoy anything I do. I dont understand how some people are able to handle going to work sometimes, my dad does it no problem. Way too often i feel the need to call out, which is a big problem since night shift coverage is always harder to find. Im just really tired and wish i could watch anime or play video games all the time"
CPTSD,I am tired,"I feel like a failure in all aspects of my life, and technically I am. I am trying to build back a life but damn! It has been a few years now, and I am still way behind. I am so so tired."
CPTSD,Ketamine therapy,"Has anyone tried ketamine therapy for treatment resistant CPTSD? I just recieved a telemarketing settlement and am considering it to get my life back. I'm not going to divulge the history of my trauma because that would take a book, but I have a serious of unfortunate events of child abuse, teenage neglect, a learning disability effecting my education, rape, poverty, caretaking of a grandparent with dementia, workplace hostility, sex work, and most recently, a nasty abusive marriage ending in divorce and a great loss of friends that didn't care to listen to my side of the story. 

The last few years have been really hard for me, and I've been on several medications for depression and in and out of therapy and honestly none of it really works. The therapy is almost always too surface level for me to get anywhere with my healing and medications only seem to work for me for a few months and then they have to start upping my dose or changing my medication when I've maxed out. For perspective, at one point I was on 250mg of trazadone and still not sleeping through the night. 

Ketamine therapy isn't covered by insurance in my state, but I just came into a modest 3k settlement and I think it could be enough to pay for ketamine therapy out of pocket. I guess I'm just looking for anecdotal evidence that it works for C-ptsd and depression."
CPTSD,Taking up space is so hard,"Just a feelings dump to get them out somewhere.

I have been testing out telling a certain friend when things they do bother me. Sometimes because Iâ€™m setting a boundary and sometimes just to express my feelings (something Iâ€™m focusing on, to show myself â€˜negativeâ€™ feelings are okay to have and all feelings are neutral, not morally coded.) Iâ€™m always kind and gentle with expressing these things and reception seems good for the most part.

The issue Iâ€™m having is that so many things they do bother me and emotionally trigger me on some level.

Iâ€™m struggling with the fear of being too needy, or emotional, or sensitive, and making my friend feel constantly criticized by me. Like they can do no right or maybe I just donâ€™t like who they are.

I wonder that myself sometimes. Iâ€™ve had this friend since I was 16 and they have done a lot of things that actually created, solidified or worsened some triggers for me in my teens. They struggle a lot with their mental health and Iâ€™ve poured so much of myself into supporting them all these years.

I feel like we have a good connection and we share a lot of the same interests, but I donâ€™t think I trust them to not hurt me in the ways they have in the past so I struggle to really open up to them. Some basic things they say make me spiral because I feel so unseen with them while actively hiding myself. Iâ€™m trying to remedy it by speaking up but like I said, it feels like thereâ€™s SO MUCH they do that bothers me.

The thought of ending the friendship has crossed my mind over the years, and I did distance myself for a while, but weâ€™re spending more time together the past year and connecting more. I love them and want them in my life so Iâ€™m investing in them by trying these things but part of me doesnâ€™t want to fully let them in. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far."
CPTSD,The person that freed me is dead.,"She died in September, but I was too ill to frequent the group we both were members of or communicate to her directly for a long time, so I only found out today.

Despite having her faults like every other human, she is one of the best people I ever heard of. The last decade of her life she spent volunteering for people with certain pain conditions, making sure they have access to the newest scientific information, giving advice and comfort. But that's not all. She raised someone who had run away from an abusive home, had a rescue dog, was a great artist and always kept her eyes open to see where she could help.

That's how I met her. I'm not sure I'd still be alive without her. While having moved out as soon as I turned 18, I was still in contact with my abusive family and had two incidents where one of them wanted to kill me between moving out and meeting her. She contacted me when I was stuck in a bad hospital to help me trough. During our conversations she felt that there was more behind it. So she created a safe space for me to talk and lead me to tell her. She explained to me the gaslighting and manipulation that kept me a victim. She comforted me. She made me realise I have the same rights as every other human being. She helped me to get away from what I was raised to believe and develop self worth. She pointed out that I was showing clear signs of CPTSD and motivated me to get help. It was also her, who recognised I had a second pain disorder I didn't know about and encouraged me during the journey to get a diagnosis (I had shied away from that as the pain had been belittled for years).

This woman changed my life and probably saved it. And now she is gone. The world lost a truly amazing person who made it her life goal to help others. 

I made the resolution to follow her footsteps as well as I can and to make a positive impact on the life of others. And I will fight to overcome the CPTSD and live up to the potential she saw in me.

In answering a commentary I realised that there's something I haven't mentioned in my post: My account name goes back to something she said. She encouraged me by saying ""You're like a dandelion, growing through concrete and blossoming against all odds."" That stuck with me and is a reminder that I'm not weak, but strong and resilient. "
CPTSD,Problems accepting having PTSD symptoms,"There may be a good reason some of us have a hard time accepting that we have actual PTSD.  A big reason is we've heard since childhood that PTSD is for soldiers.   

But I think another good reason may be when it's persistent over a long time, like it can often be with CPTSD, we get used to it.  It becomes our normal and we may not even think there's something wrong.  

Also, if you're having re-experiencing in dreams instead of flashbacks, the nightmares are 'thematically' related to the traumatic events (see link below).  We might think PTSD means dreaming of only the exact events.  

Another reason is that flashbacks can happen in a way where we're not cognitively aware of the past event when we're re-experiencing it, we just have the same intense emotions as the event.  But for PTSD and CPTSD, that's one of the ways re-experiencing can happen.

CPTSD,"I wish it didn't happen to me. But it did, and nobody did anything to help.","26F

My earliest trauma was around 8-10 years old; it was mainly emotional and physical neglect and witnessing multiple violent abuses. (separate from this topic) It started when I went on dating apps at 14; I showed my face. I was groomed by a 25-year-old man who manipulated me into dating him at 16 years old. I gained a lot of weight and then lost it at 17 due to stress; I escaped him to be with another man. That other man I trusted eventually raped me. I was with him for almost four years. I would drink and take drugs with him and on my own. 

This whole part of my life was very chaotic. I never got help; I told people about it I trusted. They shrugged it off. Whenever I remember, it feels weird, like it didn't happen because I was silenced and dismissed. I don't know what to do with this pain. This deep feeling as though a part of me was damaged, stolen, taken advantage of and abused. A part of me that is no longer there. 

I assume this lingering feeling decades later; it must be like this for the rest of my life? "
CPTSD,What is soul retrieval and what are good books on it?,"I was sexually abused as child and was raped on an almost daily basis for about five years and in 2023 I was raped in my sleep by someone I trusted.  I still remember the feeling of the remaining half of my soul abandoning my body. 

Iâ€™ve been talking in some support group about my experiences and Iâ€™ve been suggested to read about soul retrieval by multiple people I think this is a good place to ask about it."
CPTSD,I feel like therapy wonâ€™t fix loneliness,"Iâ€™m an imigrant, I have studied here in this country, got a job, but I could never really find friends, because everyone already had their friends and social circle, while I was working hard for my survival, literally. It made me depressed and I felt lonely.  

Being an imigrant is hard, I had to come to a new city completely alone, without support, i was robbed not once only at 19, going to uni, find a job, my parents were abusive so I couldnâ€™t go home. I thought about going into therapy to have someone at least to talk to.

Without understanding and taking into consideration my sociocultural situation they started pathologising me and diagnosing me.
Asking intrusive questions about why am I lonely, it certainly has to be a character pathology that I donâ€™t have a partner etc. (Even in the DSM they warn not to diagnose patients if their â€œsymptomsâ€ are not caused by mental health problems but are products of socioeconomical situation). 

So, if you are just lonely, because of the things you couldnâ€™t possibly control, you simply wonâ€™t get help. Help is only for those with mental health issues, and if you donâ€™t have any, they will diagnose you anyway."
CPTSD,How did EMDR changed your life?,"Did your life improve? What big and small changes did you notice?
Right now I am a university student and I struggle a lot with my class attendance, routines, self discipline, constant learning, shame, self sabotage, self hatred, positive feelings, an ,,organized mindâ€œ and so on. My EMDR therapy starts in 6 months. 

My life looks like this:
I want to attend the classes, cant sleep at night, oversleep in the morning, miss the class.
I want to attend the next class, I cant get up because I am feeling to depressed, miss the class.
I need many hours to get up, want to learn, cant focus. 
I feel like I am failing every day. I have hopes that once I start EMDR, life will get easier and I gain the strenght to get up on time, get ready on time, attend the class with a strong focus and to master my classes. 

Is this possible?"
CPTSD,My dad gave away the only thing I asked for after my mum died...,"I posted this elsewhere too but it's in a holding thing and I just need someone to hear me... 



This is the straw that broke the camels back. 


I deleted my other posts but long story short - I stood up for my nibbling who was being abused and my family cut me off. My mum got sick and no one told me she was sick or dying until after she died. Dad gave the excuse of having no time to think, too much to do, but had time to get family from hours away, but didn't tell me my mum was dying 5 minutes away from my house. He wanted me to go to the funeral and I did, where everyone ignored me. 


Since then, dad and I have tried to have a relationship. We text every couple of weeks, go for lunch or a drink (he drinks) every other month or so. We try to talk. I'm really trying. But I see that he's completely uninterested in everything I say. I don't know if maybe I'm just completely boring and that's why his eyes glaze over whenever I open my mouth, or if he genuinely just doesn't care. It was the same way whenever I tried to talk to mum. It hurts. 


When she died, I asked for one thing of hers. I didn't want anything expensive. My siblings got all of her jewellery, her wedding rings etc. 

She had this costume jewellery necklace that she gave me when I was a teenager. She wore it when we were really young. I wore it when I was young. I left it there when I moved out years ago. But it was important to me. I asked dad for it. He said he had seen it, and that he'd bring it me. 


Weeks went by, and he didn't. I eventually asked again and he said it was broken so he threw it out. I was heartbroken and I cried after. One thing. I asked for one thing. I didn't care if it was broken. I could have fixed it. Or even if I couldn't, it didn't matter. I only asked for one thing... 


I tried to move past it. Maybe he didn't think about it the same way I did. I mean, I got over him not telling me mum was dying, I can get over him throwing away her broken necklace... And I did. 


He spent mums birthday, 6 month anniversary, his birthday, sibs birthdays, Christmas all together. I was alone for all of them, including my own birthday. 


Then a stupid tiktok came up on my page. My nibling. Wearing mums necklace. But maybe it's a coincidence. Maybe it's just similar... Then more tiktoks, and I'm sure it's the necklace. And everything in me wants to ask him. But I know if I do, he will lie. And I also know, that I'm at the metaphorical fork in the road. Because this is my breaking point. Part of me doesn't want to know the truth, because how can he do that to me? One thing. I asked for one singular thing of mum's. It meant nothing to anyone but me and her. It holds no monetary or sentimental value to anyone but us. How can he do that to me? So I tell myself not to ask... Because I don't think I can forgive this. I forgave the worst already... This is just lower than low right? (or am I completely overreacting???) 



Today I saw my nibling. And I didn't mean to. I really didn't. But it was like word vomit and the words just fell out of my mouth. I asked if it was nanny's necklace. They said it was, and how grandad just knew it was something they'd love. How much they love it.

I didn't make it a big deal, I told them how happy I am to see it again, that they get to wear it and remember nanny. That it suits them. I didn't tell them that dad promised it me. And I am truly happy for them. But my heart is broken for me and I feel selfish. They all have so many things of my mums. I only wanted one thing. One thing that meant so much to me. And he gave it away and my heart is hurting. 


I have forgiven so very much in this family. So so much abuse and manipulation and terrible things that no one should ever do. But I don't think I can move past this. But it feels ridiculous to blow up over a piece of costume jewellery. But I'm done. I'm so so done. I'm so hurt right now. 


Am I overreacting? Please help me sort through my feelings here because I'm completely lost..."
CPTSD,I am sick of David Goggins spammed everywhere and it makes me cringe and a bit triggered,"A disclaimer to perhaps those saying that ""I am just hating him because he is more fit than me"" - it's not about that fact completely.
I admire the fact that he was able to pull himself out of the s*ithole he was in and to get to almost superhuman levels of fitness. I admire his fortitude.

I am writing this all as a person who was able to go from having had a mild disability statement due to suspicion of muscular dystrophy (which fortunately turned out not to be the case) to doing half- marathons. 

What I really dislike is the fact that he is so obnoxious about it - like, seriously, people who do sub 2h marathons like Kipchogee or Kiptum are a total, polar opposite - they are reserved, humble and likeable.
The thing that I believe is dangerous about this guy is that he promotes an approach that is unsustainable - to abuse your body and do the physical activity not because you like it but through dissociating from your sensations. Like, seriously, doing a 100mi race to break your feet and pee blood in urine is not something that I would like to preach to anyone as a viable fitness goal...
His behaviour and especially this of his followers is also really condescending towards people who struggle with variety of stuff and perhaps do not have the resources to ""pull themselves by their bootstraps"" like he managed to do. 

What are your thoughts?"
CPTSD,Travelling with CPTSD/depression,"I haven't left my state for 8 years (Victoria, Australia). Everyone around me travels domestically or internationally multiple times a year and I can't relate any more. In my 20's I went on three trips to South East Asia for 1-3 months at a time, and would travel to another city in my country a few times a year. I'm now in my mid 30's with severe travel anxiety.

Honestly it was always really hard, and often I would fly home earlier then expected and cut trips short due to high anxiety/depression symptoms and feeling shaky and insecure all the time. But I guess being younger I would still take the risk, but now the fear has taken over.

The last few years I've been in and out of therapy exploring my CPTSD symptoms, and honestly I haven't got very far. I've had long periods of housing/financial/mental health instability that have come and gone in waves and at the moment my money and housing is ok so I want to seize the moment and go on a trip but all the cptsd/and depression stuff makes me want to isolate myself and stick with what I already know instead of going out and exploring.

Do people here travel much? And how do you manage your symptoms while you're travelling?"
CPTSD,How to not internalize other peopleâ€™s reactions/emotions?,"I just started a new job working as a dispatcher for a private HVAC company and this is something I would like to work on so that I donâ€™t run for the hills (aka quit) the second someone else is having a bad day. I tend to internalize how others are feeling and assume itâ€™s always my fault. I havenâ€™t worked at jobs for more than a few months because of this. 

If anyone has any tips, videos, or articles on this subject I would appreciate it so much. This is something Iâ€™ve been stuck on for a while and I have no idea how to get off this treadmill of misery that Iâ€™m putting myself through."
CPTSD,"Anyone else feel like their trauma is too vague, spaced out and not severe enough to be valid?","I've only recently read into CPTSD and nothing has ever resonated with me more in terms of describing the symptoms I have. I've been labelled as having anxiety for a decade and OCD was queried more recently, but treatment for GAD and OCD isn't really doing much for me at all.

The only thing I'm questioning myself on before bringing this up to my therapist is that my trauma isn't bad enough for it to be a post traumatic stress thing? I had some bad parts to my childhood, sure, but I was never beaten or anything like that.

For context, my parents divorced when I was 2 (I'm 23 now) and there has been animosity between them for my entire life. Custody was split 50/50 and I was often left to be the messenger, arranging my own childcare. I would get criticised for forgetting my parents plans etc when I was only like, 10.

My mum is sort of like a teenager in an adult's body. I've seen her scream at her partners, her mood would change rapidly and unexpectedly and she would guilt trip me frequently. She had multiple different boyfriends who would be prioritised over me, they were all unstable relationships. I've been taken out of my bed as a child before for my mum to argue with her boyfriend in a carpark in the middle of the night. 

I've seen the holes kicked in the walls and been told of glasses being thrown, doors being kicked down etc. I know my mum kicked my dad with her heels and slapped him before. Never saw those things myself but I was aware of them.

I've been left in a tent unattended as a 12 year old because my mum was too drunk to stand up, and she pushed me away and told me to fuck off when I tried to help her. She then disappeared into a bar for hours. Had my first panic attack because I thought the men she went in the bar with might rape her. She didn't care about my panic attack when she eventually came back and went to sleep.

My mum loudly had sex with her ex boyfriends with me in the house, I would have panic attacks. She got angry at me for asking her to be quiet because it was making me really uncomfortable (I was about 14 then).

My parents would compare me to each other when they were mad at me. My mum would frequently ditch me with my dad when she had plans, or drag me along to parties/events that were not massively child friendly at times. My mum also abandoned me when I was 17 as she uprooted her life suddenly and moved to another part of the country with her boyfriend at the time. She did a lot of things wrong, but I was extremely attached to her and this was devastating.

A big thing is that my mum would sort of treat me as a friend or a therapist? She's clung to me and sobbed during break ups and arguments, she's unloaded her relationship issues on me and I've had to interrupt her arguments to calm her and her partner down. 

I had plenty of stability and good experiences with my dad as well though. And like I said, nobody ever hit me or properly abused me. There was just a lot of abandonment and I suppose arguably some neglect? Sorry for the long rant, just needed someone to see this."
CPTSD,Does anyone have a seemingly normal parent that you later realized had something wrong with them? My father admitted to not feeling any emotions like fear or guilt which lead me to multiple epiphanies.,"I spent a long time really blinded by my love and adoration for my father. If he said jump, I would ask how high.  However, I started to hate him beginning in 2021 and after a huge blow out fight earlier this year, I went no contact with everyone in my huge family. I just disappeared. 

Something that stood out during our fight is that he said he didnâ€™t feel any fear during a medical emergency that put him in a coma. He said he felt nothing but wanted to get through it â€œfor his kids.â€

The weird thing is he has never really done anything for us. He didnâ€™t work hard or sacrifice for us. He married women he could control that abused the kids he brought into this world. He did enough to trick them into marrying them before using their money and homes as his own. He never protected us from his abusive partners, he just said enough to make it seem like he was on our side before going right back to staying with them. Our safety and wellbeing was never his priority, controlling us through any means necessary was. 

I realized after our fight that he would sort of say whatever he could to do damage control. Him and my mom would talk shit about me together, my mom cussed me out after I had a fight with my dad a few days later after initially being understanding of it. She was saying things like â€œyour father doesnâ€™t understand how you could yell at him, he doesnâ€™t even know what he did, heâ€™s a good man!â€ This was after we were lamenting about his lifelong misogyny and neglect during one moment of peace between us. I realized he would shit talk me to my mom and anyone around him for damage control. Once I went NC, I also have had flashbacks to him sexually abusing me. 

My mom was so overtly unwell that he seemed safe despite never express a human emotion in his life. He had never expressed a true emotion, he manipulated people to get what he wants, he showcases antisocial behaviors, and I realize I know nothing about him on a deep level. He hides it and gets made when you react to him hurting or neglecting you. 

Have you had a parent that appeared normal to you in childhood but ultimately got a clear picture of the truth as you got older?"
CPTSD,I hate the fact that I feel nothing when it comes to my trauma,"I want to be angry but I cant. I cant feel anything. Itâ€™s nothing. Itâ€™s empty. There is a deep space between me and that part of me.

If I could tap into it, would it make me a better man? Or would it ruin me completely. 

I want to find out."
CPTSD,Feel like my friend who I adore doesnâ€™t respect me at all. Struggling not to spiral negatively.,"I have been planning a trip for nearly a year and invited my friend twice. She said both times it sounded really great, but never confirmed if she wanted to join. 

Yesterday she told me she and her family are going on a trip, the month before I planned to go on mine, and theyâ€™re going to the EXACT same place to do the exact same things. Like literally the same tiny, remote town a very long way from here, to do the same specific nature excursion. Justâ€¦by themselves, without me, and no acknowledgement of the fact that this is the exact trip Iâ€™d planned and invited my friend to. 

??? 

Am I not supposed to feel really slighted by this? Itâ€™s so weird. 

On the phone I just fawned as always and said I hope you guys have a wonderful trip, so now I feel like the moment to ask WHY is gone. 

I feel really weird and confused."
CPTSD,Acceptance and Commitment therapy is the secret to healing,"
Do you accept your negative thoughts or do you judge them?

Do you accept that you have anxiety or do you hate yourself for it?

Do you accept the person you see in the mirror?

Do you judge yourself when you judge others?

Do you argue with yourself in your head?

Do you judge yourself for being â€œbrokenâ€?

Do you think that your thoughts should be all positive and judge yourself when you feel or think something negative?

When we reject our experience of the world, this includes thoughts and feelings, we reject ourselves. This rejection of self is no different and perhaps worse than when we are rejected from society. 

Therapies I tried that didnâ€™t help: EDMR, IFS, DBT, and CBT. I tried these therapies for over a year with very little progress in my panic disorder and still found my past to be extremely triggering. 

After just 1 month of acceptance and commitment therapy, I managed to successfully prevent an oncoming panic attack for the first time in 3 years. I cried tears of joy because this has never happened before. I felt hopeful for the first time in my life. Iâ€™ve also been able to recall past traumatic memories without dissociating. My confidence is rising, my self worth is increasing. And Iâ€™m beginning to integrate my traumatized past. 

About acceptance and commitment therapy: It was founded by a doctor called Steven Hayes who also struggled with panic attacks. The therapy takes a lot of Buddhist practices on mindfulness and puts it into a therapy environment. Itâ€™s all about accepting yourself as you are. Accepting the good and the bad. It sounds so simple but because of our western culture, this is something we are not taught.

I canâ€™t believe something so simple is what has been changing my brain, after spending so much money on complex therapies this is what works for me. I hope this can help someone else â¤ï¸

CPTSD,"Active SI, donâ€™t want help this time","I was diagnosed with cptsd about 4 yrs ago now, went through trauma therapy and emdr.
Had a break up a few months ago. Am 39, not my first break up, but I canâ€™t keep doing this anymore. Also dealt with health issues the past 2 yrs and having had surgery and realizing friends donâ€™t seem to want to step up to help even when itâ€™s necessary, I just donâ€™t see a lot of reasons to stick around anymore. Combined with the state of the world, not finding joy in anything anymore, just wanting things to be done already..

Iâ€™ve cycled through active and passive si for years, always reached out for help when it became active. I never attempted, only planned. When I get really really low itâ€™s usually hormonal, suspect pmdd, and one or two days later I feel better again, but am not in that part of my cycle. 
If in some days I still feel as bad as I do now, Iâ€™ll be going to the spot I chose. Itâ€™s a 90m tall building, with my bodyweight it will take 5.6 seconds. Iâ€™ve started to write down passwords and such so family can access my laptop, phone and bank accounts. Thereâ€™s not much more to arrange I think. Some outstanding bills can be paid from savings, the rest I think they inherit automatically. I have a college debt which I hope will just be annulled. Feels better just to write this all out. I have a plan, a way out. I donâ€™t have to do any of this anymore."
CPTSD,Batlling with isolation and loneliness,"With progress towards healing came this realisation that I donâ€™t really have any one backing me up. On one hand I have emotionally absent family, and on other hand I have friendships that are more or less bound to materialistic things.
All my life I have chased emotionally unavailable people, I really feel sorry for my inner child that finds the long lost rather non existent warmth and comfort of earlier times, whenever someone shows even a hint of interest in my life.
Right now all I can feel is pity for myself for how helpless I find myself. Day in and day out I am surrounded by people but Iâ€™ve failed to form a connection where I can just be myself.
I have spent a lot of time and money to change something that seems to be destined for me.
No amount of self-care can make up for the lack of having any form of support.
While I really donâ€™t want to give up on life but it is getting harder everyday to ignore what seems to me is the harsh reality.
Just wanted to let you all know that I tried with all mu might but it takes a bit of luck and support to conquer this illness which I lack in."
CPTSD,Anyone else feeling so disconnected from everyone else?,"It really seems I'm fundamentally different from everyone else I meet, except my sister but we went through the same shit. Is this normal?"
CPTSD,I was good. I thought.,"I feel like in that scene in The godfather. For two days I was â€œokâ€. You know, that fleeting sensation that I was good and even I even considered that I may have to stop seeing my psychologist, that all my mental problems were solved, just with the new year, Â¡a new me has been born!

And thenâ€¦ Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!

And by â€œtheyâ€ I mean â€œmeâ€. Today I feel like q complete shitshow. Four hours awake in bed, nearly crying. Sense of wanting to disappear back again. And hey! My day is ruined so I would have time later on to feel how much I wasted the few days I have of vacances.

I guess, I need more time to heal."
CPTSD,Why is the generic advice on helplines or self help articles always so awful and unhelpful?,"Every single time I've read something or been told something off one of these it's resulted in me feeling infinitely worse off and even my immediate reactions to the advice is usually on the suicidal side. What would be previously just slight negative feelings always becomes extreme anger and a feeling of isolation whenever I'm faced with them. I feel like I'm not human or something when the advice is so completely far off from anything I needed to hear. It makes the feeling of not belonging so much worse since the so highly held resources supposedly available are completely useless for me and I'm just left wondering what the hell is so wrong or different about me that makes it like this. Is it really just me or is the advice actually not productive for anyone else? I honestly don't know if I'm just crazy at this point. 

For some examples of what advice I'm talking about things like ""you ONLY need yourself to love you"", ""exercise/meditate""(that one is particularly unhelpful when it's the only thing that's continually repeated when I'm looking for actual support), ""get support from your family/friends"" (just reminds me of how I don't have that no matter how much I try to make some), ""don't try, let everything come to you"" (left here waiting my whole life for things that I need but don't come by easily), ""tell an authority figure"" (code for get sent to be traumatized more at a mental hospital), ""know you are loved"" (by who? Santa Claus? Or did you mean abusers? It's based on assumptions that have no guarantee for some people, is impersonal, and can send the wrong message with saying someone still loves you even if they're bad to you with you having no way of already knowing it)"
CPTSD,How to get energy and quickly recharge after trauma trigger or anxiety episode,"I have been on high alert since yesterday evening, slept 5 hours, my body is jittery and it feels like I have anxiety attack happening on background. While I know the trigger, it doesn't really help to get the energy back. I feel so tired, and the day has barely started. 

My shift starts in half an hour, and I can't skip it. Though I work from home today, I feel like even that is pushing it too far. I'm exhausted physically, and mentally on top of that. 

Do you have any quick tips how to get energy back after being in adrenaline state for too long/having trauma trigger/anxiety episode?

 I tried to breathe deeply with exhale being longer than inhale, but it just made me sleepy."
CPTSD,Why can I resonate so much with this sub. When I don't remember any kind of abuse or trauma in my childhood,"At every post I am like, That's me. All the emotional struggles, the blurry childhood, difficulty expressing my needs, ensuring self care etc. but I don't remember any abuse etc in my childhood or anything that would count as traumatic. My parents were a bit indifferent and in their own. A little low functioning and emotionally dysregulated (saying without judgement) but don't recall any instance, where they were traumatically bad towards me. I don't really know why I am writing this. I have heard C-PTSD, but I am always like that this doesn't apply to me because I don't recall any instance that was traumatic. "
CPTSD,How to work on discipline for someone who was controled by theri strong emotions the majority of their lives?,"Please share with us any tips or ways to use to develop and maintain discipline in your life.

CPTSD,Cannabis for CPTSD - Avoiding tolerance,"Posting this for a friend that does not have reddit and is unable to engage in any online activity. 


""I was sent to a very poorly planned treatment for Complex PTSD due to budget cuts in the health system. 

After the treatment I get constant flashbacks from recovered supressed memories through out the whole day. My nerve system blew out and I among other things developed chronic fatigue. My nerve system is constantly activated, and I am always on fight or flight mode, as I don't need any external triggers, I get triggered by the flashbacks.

About two years ago I tried CBD oil, which helped somewhat as it helped with the flashbacks, I went up to the maximum reccomended dose, reccomended by the CBD supplier.

About one year ago I started to use cannbis, that also helped to relax my nerve system, for a more stable effect I started to vape the cannabis. 

I just purchased a decarboxylator and made butter, I have never experienced such a stable effect. 

What I wanted to ask the people that use medicinal marijuana and are dependent on it for daily use, is how do you go about avoding tolerance build up as taking a break isn't really possible. 

I've read that changing consumption method can help, switching from smoking, to vaping to edibles.

Also regarding edibles is there any difference in consuming for example butter and oil?"""
CPTSD,Daily & Weekly Routines of Self-care?,"I'm double-blessed with CPTSD and long covid, and it's made my existence as miserable as I could ever imagine it getting. I know lots of things I ""need"" to do take care of myself and minimize symptoms, but the brainfog from that double-dose of goodness makes consistency near impossible.

If I could get a few daily and weekly practices in place (with a formal doc and sign it in order to REALLY commit). Does anyone have daily and/or weekly routines for self-care that you can share with us?"
CPTSD,How can one be safe without any tribe in this world?,"Feel so unsafe in this anonymous and mean world. Always meeting new people. No way to make deep connections in order to feel safe and trust. People coming and going. If you have no friends or partner it is no wonder if you get all kinds of symptoms. It is like any animal without their pack, herd or tribe. 


What a crazy world"
CPTSD,"Too scared to speak, too scared to ignore","This socks. When I'm triggered I'll put my head down and try to escape where I am at, but when I'm forced to be there, I'll go to say something to someone and just end up giving this pained expression with a half smile.

I'm safety seeking, but it feel like I want to say goodbye or something, and then I don't have the energy or confidence to say goodbye. Happens heaps at work.

I guess it's because I couldn't speak up, runaway, or even just ignore my parents growing up without getting raged at.

And even though it's not my fault, I get a lot of confused reactions. Fucking sucks."
CPTSD,How to deal with intense nightmare?,"Had a very intense nightmare last night. This one feels different from other dreams/nightmares ive had.

Two weeks ago my therapist told me I may have CPTSD (she doesnâ€™t offer formal diagnoses because she doesnâ€™t want to label people). Iâ€™ve been struggling with the news.

Last night, I had a very intense nightmare in which I was trying to tell my mom and aunt I had (possibly) gotten sexually abused as a child, and when I was about to tell my aunt she said I know something happened to you as a child, a man took advantage of you. And I started screaming in my nightmare in terror and when I woke up it was like that emotional scream came from deep within and I was paralysed in fear. I couldnâ€™t go back to sleep after that till the morning, I was really disturbed and hypervigilant all night.

Did this nightmare happen because ive been overthinking things about my CPTSD, or is it like a trauma nightmare or something? What do you even call it? Why is this happening now? And how do you deal with such nightmares? Because now im officially scared of sleeping."
CPTSD,How to sleep?,"been in a religious boarding school since 9, and they had strick routines, morning prayers at 5 each day, plus I was molested in my sleep, cant rememeber how many times. Now even when my body wants sleep my brain is always on its toes, alert.

CPTSD,Book recommendation on relationships and boundaries?,"Hello everyone,
Last year I read ""Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" and it really helped me explain a lot of my experiences. Right now I'm looking for a similar book, but one that's specifically helps navigate interpersonal relationships as a person with CPTSD, guides the reader on how to establish boundaries and advocate for themself and such. Essentially what to do in your relationships as an adult with CPTSD. 

Has anyone read a book like that and can you recommend it to others?"
CPTSD,First selfie from right side intentionally ever,"I know this sounds stupid or vain but I'm a 20 year old afab who takes selfies and 2024 is my first year full no contact ever -trying to get comfortable w my gender and face now

Rlly proud :pp it's been a while getting to this point but my first whole week no contact and so much is alr changing

Big wins all 2024 eveeyone <3"
CPTSD,People are very insecure and it is triggering me,"I do not really know what happened. It might sound selfish but that is not my point. 


It started around pandemic maybe. And it is that people have got so insecure. And even adults. Everyone seem hyper sensitive and observant, and it is not to bash anyone who is, but for me that sets me off because I get uncomfortable. Especially women I would say. And as a male it probably is because I am a male. I dress normally and everything. 


Don't know if it makes sense, but does anyone understand? If I look back 15ish years people were 'stable' or just did their thing. Now it feels like everyone tries to analyze you and you can see how they get uncomfortable. 


This limits my recovery since I do not really wanna be around people because it just makes me uncomfortable in a loop. I want these type of old people who basically had no idea what emotions were and just felt so stable. Sometimes I wonder if being too concious about emotions and self-awareness is bad in some ways. Because you analyze everything."
CPTSD,Feeling too much,"Does CPTSD cause one to feel too much ? For example when one is hurt ,you feel it more and more ,unlike other people who just get over it and move on ,when humiliated it just lingers on and on ,taking things personally so much.Is it an effect of CPTSD or just a personality flaw?"
CPTSD,Anxious days,"Every time I get close to someone, or a new group of people, I start getting awful thoughts about things that could go wrong, things I may have said/done wrong in front of them, or things they could find out which would make them hate/reject me. 

 I've just made a beautiful new group of friends who are so compassionate and funny and like-minded. But I keep ruminating over things that might make them reject me eventually. I fear that eventually they'll see me as undeserving of their friendship and support. 

Does anyone have any advice to self-regulate and stop these fears/anxieties? "
CPTSD,This is the first time I've dreamt about the negative experience that I've had which affected me a bit,"I sometimes don't know if it's right to call it sexual assault but it was definitely a lot of unconsented touching from the ages I was 12 til I was 13. It was done by my classmates.

I've had trouble with people touching me since I was a kid, I would become aggressive for some reason which came to the light again when I was 12. I was very withdrawn but defensive and this situation kinda made me snap. I would regularly slap my classmates and threaten them but I never told teachers or my parents. When I was 13, it was more intense. Instead of regular slapping, I was touched a lot by a classmate who showed ASPD like tendencies and he was much bigger than anyone else at the school really. On multiple occasions, I've slapped him as well impulsively and the rage he had to contain not to crush me was enough for me to notice in his eyes and stance. I was afraid of him. I begged them all to stop and my anger issues were at peak when I was 13. I thought this wouldn't affect me a lot but I developed ED somewhere around that age, I was already affected when I was 13.

Last night, I've had a similar dream, being touched without a consent. In the dream, I was confused, angry, isolated, alone and ashamed, even threatened. So I threatened him and told him if he did that again, it would be the last thing he's done and I've started digging my nails into his arm that it was eventually cut out.

Maybe as I'm trying to recover from a relapse in ED and the eventual weight gain made me feel exposed again. It's as if the more woman like I look, the more looks I attract and the more I'm in danger. Maybe I was finally ready to address how angry and disrespected I've felt and most of all, the shame I carried. The shame around my body and inability to adequately defend myself leading me to think I'm the weakest individual on the planet. The loneliness I've felt in all that. I don't know what lead to that but it was overwhelming and real..."
CPTSD,Shamed for being sick gives me flashbacks,"My mother always downplayed when I was sick. Forcing me to go to school, or making me wake up at 3 am to wait Infront of the doctors office for 4 hours in the freezing cold. She would always treat me worse when I was sick, yelling at me when I was coughing, didn't let me enter the room she was in so I wouldn't spread my sickness to her. A lot of times she would refuse to give me medication, even when I had terrible fever. She would treat me like I'm doing it on purpose.

What lasts is shame when I am sick, that I am not even that sick and that I should be ashamed to leave my coworkers with more work. I should suck it up and still go, which I did for many years. But now I am at a point where I want to heal and prioritise myself, so if I'm sick and have a doctor's note, I stay home. The shame remains and the feeling that I will be abandoned.

My supervisor wrote me today ""it's now the 3rd time you're sick when Christian is on holiday. I'm really saddened. No one is there who can do the documents. I'm on vacation and this is really upsetting me now."" 

I know technically that it's their fault for not training more people. And that it's not my fault and I am not doing it on purpose. However the shame gets much worse with her words, same with being scared they will fire me and I will end up homeless. 

I really hope that I will receive my 50% disability soon, as then they can't fire me for being sick anymore. 

Does anyone else feel this way?"
CPTSD,something i wrote at 16,"The night before my 16th birthday, she accused me of stealing her keys (which were used to padlock every door in the house at night so i couldnâ€™t escape or wander around the house.) 

She had misplaced them while she was screaming at me, a crumpled up ball on the bathroom floor. My dad was telling her to back off but she wouldnâ€™t listen. She screamed at me, made me and my dad search the house for them. When I couldnâ€™t find them, she told me she was going to keep me home and not let me go to the mall with my boyfriend and our friends for my birthday. I was hyperventilating, crying, searching for these stupid fucking keys. She refused to search for them. She just sat on the couch with a smug smirk on her face while she watched us look. â€œI know you took them, Ava.â€ She kept saying.

I finally found them in a drawer in the bathroom. I guess sheâ€™d shoved them in there while she was bullying me. I was so happy to have found them, so I grabbed them and gave them to her. Instead of thanking me, like any normal human being would, she raged. She accused me of taking them from her (while she was screaming at me!!) and hiding them from her. I was begging her to believe me. My dad was trying to defend me, which turned into them screaming at each other. I went outside barefoot (it was January) and sat out in the cold. There was an abandoned lot where a house had burned down next door. That was always my solace whenever I had to escape. 

My dad came out and tried to coax me back in; I refused, and I remember I started going off on him. Asking him why the fuck did he not love me enough to leave her? I remember telling him i hated him, and he had failed me by allowing me to be abused by my own mother. I told him he was a worthless dad, to let me live this way. He let me finish, and these next few words changed my whole life; 

â€œI wish you wouldnâ€™t say that shit to me. Itâ€™s not true, because I just told her she needed to get the fuck out.â€ 

I didnâ€™t know what to do. I was shocked. I think i started crying and hugging him. He asked me to come back in; again the answer was no. He went back inside and a few minutes later, two cop cars pulled up. They started questioning me, apparently my mom had called the cops on my dad because she was â€œscared of him.â€ That man never layed a hand on her. One of the cops went inside to my parents and the other stayed outside with me. He told me I needed to find somewhere else to stay for the night because I wasnâ€™t safe there. So I went inside to get my shit to go to my friendsâ€™ house. When I walked in, she glared at me and started screaming at me again . I remember her saying â€œThis is exactly what you wanted, huh? I bet youâ€™re happy now! Youâ€™re ruining my marriage so you can fuck your dad, good job Ava!â€ I just laughed at her. I told her she was insane. And then I left. The cops threatened to arrest her for belligerent behavior because even they were disgusted.

I stayed at my friendâ€™s house that night. She called me all night. I refused to pick up the phone, so she started texting my friendâ€™s phone, asking to speak to me, saying she was sorry. I ignored her. The next day at school she tried to come pick me up early to â€œtake me to therapy.â€ (An old white lady on my momâ€™s side who agreed with my mom I was off the rails and insane. This woman was accusing me and my 15 year old friends and boyfriend of being in a gang when we live in rural tennessee, and was in psychosis due to a health issue. She accused us of bugging our whole house to hack it, pawned all my items, and boarded up my window when i never escaped without permission except to sit in the backyard and stargaze.) 

The issue wasnt me. It was my mother. I tried to refuse going home with her as long as I could, but the guidance counselor told me if I didnâ€™t go home I had to go to a shelter, so I finally gave up and went to leave with her. As I was walking up to her from behind, I heard her saying to a few of the guidance counselors/school police officers â€œAvaâ€™s a liar. You canâ€™t trust anything she says. She has some serious issues- just be patient with her.â€ This absolutely fucking infuriated me. 

It was an awful sweet 16. She ran off with another man a month later.


iâ€™m 20 now and it still hurts"
CPTSD,proud that iâ€™m allowing myself to have what i deserve in a relationship.,"iâ€™ve in my 30s and itâ€™s probably a given that iâ€™ve struggled with intimate relationships. for the first time in my life i feel like im dating someone who wants to see me as i am and likes everything i show him about myself. i have gone through such a journey to feel comfortable challenging myself in a relationship like this where itâ€™s healthy but therefore uncomfortable. 

the first time we were intimate, i had a strong emotional response and iâ€™m not sure if i had told him i had ptsd at that point but his automatic response was to hold me and tell me that iâ€™m safe with him. he just knows the right thing to do. 

last night, unprompted, before bed we were close together and the last thing he said before passing out was â€œiâ€™ll keep you safeâ€

iâ€™m appalled by the contrast between this and my previous relationships where a year into dating, i didnâ€™t even feel like i could cry around my partner. anything i would have hid from them, i can talk to him about. he is so special and i tell him how much i appreciate him every day!!


i am actively trying not to say that im â€œspoiledâ€ by this relationship because i feel it implies i donâ€™t deserve this level of kindness. and its even been difficult to accept at times but

i am generally proud of myself for allowing myself to have what i deserve in a partner."

CPTSD,how do you deal with the feeling of â€œit wasnâ€™t that bad after allâ€.,"I have done a self assessment ptsd test two times with my counselor at my health center which scores high enough for a ptsd diagnosis but I wonâ€™t get refreshed to a psychiatrist until they have tried a treatment plan which is first the cbt-therapy and then medicine.

I have now had a year of cbt-therapy to relearn to be alright with feeling feelings, having arguments and such.

I still have high anxiety, I get kinda flashbacks but they are more like feelings than images. Like it can be rather every day type of memories that follows an intense feeling of shame. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m there when the memory happens but itâ€™s not a dangerous memory. Just a super intense feeling of shame, regret,  sometimes fear.

There are other stuff as well, anyway the cbt have helped but not gotten rid of my problems and now I have just started taking escitalopram. Itâ€™s not the most fun experience to start with, I kinda feel like shit but itâ€™s supposed to sort itself out.

But I need to take this for a couple of months and have trauma focused cpt where I revisit the memories to â€œget used to themâ€. But I donâ€™t really know how thatâ€™s gonna work when the images themself isnâ€™t â€œdangerousâ€. I mean I can think about the situation or at least some of them whitout triggering anything but then when they pop up in my head with images, sounds it still brings that sting feeling of shame.

Im starting to think Iâ€™m just making everything up."
CPTSD,Connect with a stand in parent?,I recently saw a tik-tok where a lady was crying because her homophobic parents didn't congratulate her on her engagement. The video was dueted by a man talking about being stand in parent for lgbt people with unsupportive families for emotional support or to be there for major milestones etc. Is there anything like that for adults with cptsd? I just want a parent lol
CPTSD,I donâ€™t think I even want to try and have a relationship with my mother anymore.,"Hello. If you want more context to how my family is please look at the previous post on this account. Also I didnâ€™t note this in the original post but I am 14 so I probably donâ€™t understand a lot yet but Iâ€™m realising a lot of stuff pretty early so I want some help from more experienced people. 

So, very funnily enough.. after I got back home my mother breached my trust AGIAN. She did her â€œmeltdownâ€ thing where she moves my entire room around because it was a bit messy and because â€œI canâ€™t keep my room clean so I donâ€™t deserve to have a choice.â€ After 4 days of anxiety and realising how fucked up my family is I totally exploded. At first it was just terror where I said â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with youâ€¦?â€ And she would say â€œwell whatâ€™s wrong with YOU?â€ 
I rambled on about how I didnâ€™t trust her anymore and how I had to stop caring about her because she made everything feel like my fault for years, or how my old crappy therapist sided with her and made me feel like a bad person Iâ€™ve told two of my current therapist how bad she was and they were both extremely concerned, my mother just 
told me it mustâ€™ve been a misunderstanding. It wasnâ€™t. She told me how making my room messy was â€œa big fuck you to meâ€. Agian, I have adhd and have a lot of depressive episodes. I donâ€™t talk to her about my depressive episodes because I donâ€™t trust her but she knows I have adhd and how hard it is to motivate me. 

I left the room and told my dad about her being insane, I tried leaving the house but she forced me back in and started ranting to me about how she spent hours cleaning my room for me and how much of an ungrateful piece of shit I am or whatever. I just went outside.

After a whole thing of me waiting to leave for therapy for 2 hours, my dad telling me how my mum acts like this because she wants me to feel better. I went inside my dads office for a bit, my brother (10) saw me crying a hour earlier and asked what happened. I told him mum was being kind of an idiot and moved everything in my room without telling me. After a bit of talking I cut him off saying â€œdude. Once you turn 18, Iâ€™m getting you out of here.â€ 

Then I started getting ready to leave I went back inside the house and heard my mom full on crying. I kind of felt bad but this is the millionth time something like this has happened. She does stuff like this, I call her out for it, she cries about how sheâ€™s a terrible mother and then gives a shit apology mostly talking about how she is hurt or whatever. 

I finally got to therapy and talked to her about how I think I have cptsd and depression and talked about multiple traumatic incidents in my life. She told me that I have definitely experienced trauma, and that my family situation is bad, but itâ€™s hard to really tell if you have cptsd at this point in my life. Thatâ€™s what I expected, itâ€™s just good to know what Iâ€™ll probably get when I move out. 

Went back to my grandparents for a few hours before going back home. I told my grandma I wanted to go to her house the next day, but my dad said I should talk to my mother to â€œclear the airâ€. As expected, she sent a lengthy nothing burger apology. If you know me, one of my biggest pet peeves is saying sorry to someone who absolutely doesnâ€™t deserve it. But for some reason, I just replied with this. 

Okay then

I forgive you. 

I mean, I didnâ€™t really forgive her. When I sent that, a thought popped in my brain going â€œthatâ€™s the biggest lie youâ€™ve ever said in your life.â€ 

She comes into my room an hour later, acting like everything was normal again. I felt sick, fucking SICK to my stomach. I have this anxious habit of breathing frantically even though I can breathe normally when Iâ€™m extremely anxious and terrified. Once she left the room I was panting. I started searching through my diaries of every single time Iâ€™ve been through this with her, and a million incidents over the past 7 years came to my brain. I started panting and my eyes felt super watery. I realized how much this woman has done to me, and I realized that I didnâ€™t want to have a relationship with her that was real. I wanted to just lie, and lie and lie and pretend everything was real until I could leave. But at the same time the truth was so horrifying I went to bed terrified and woke up wanting to fall asleep forever. 

I donâ€™t care if she feels terrible anymore. She never said sorry. But at the same time, sheâ€™s done so many good things to me? I donâ€™t even know who my mother is anymore, but all I can see her as is a monster right now. I feel like if I tell anyone theyâ€™re just gonna say that my mum just cares about me but is showing it in a weird way, I honestly wish she was just purely evil so I wouldnâ€™t question anything."
CPTSD,Russian roulette families are the worst.,"It's never always been just bad. I think if it was just bad it would be easier to leave. But there are happy memories and happy plans entangled in there too.

And it's not like I know when it will be bad. If it was predictable maybe then I could avoid the bad and only come when its good. But it's not predictable. 

And it's not just bad people I'd be saying goodbye to. I'd be saying goodbye to good people too. Innocent people. I don't want to lose good people.

But that's what Russian roulette families are like. Sometimes it's good, sometimes nothing happens, and sometimes...well, Bang."
CPTSD,My love for drama in a relationship is more than the love for peace and itâ€™s ruining everything,"When I was in middle school I was in a friend group for three years and then realized they barely care about me. It traumatized me so now, when I became friends with someone 22f I would have a really specific habit.

The habit is that after I hangout my brain thinks to a moment during the hangout that was negative and it becomes very problematic to me. Everything in my being says that itâ€™s a really important problem. So literally whenever I have a hangout I do this. Then I bring it up with her and she needs to spend considerable time talking me out of my negative thought process.

For example I hung out twice with her. The first time was good. The second time, she was talking about how last time we hung out was magical.

When I got home I began becoming convinced that she was lovebombing me by saying that last night was magical. I brought it up and she said she only meant it was a good time.

I realized I do this so much because I love the drama. I love having an issue be brought forward and to be the one to realize that itâ€™s a sign of a bad toxic relationship. The issue is I think this about her every time. Every single thing that seems bad repeats in my mind consistently. And the more I see her, the more intensely it happens.

Why canâ€™t I learn my lesson about it and why am I so scared that I end up too naive to see the relationship will be a waste of time? I want to so badly avoid being around a bad person that I create the bad energy I fear."
CPTSD,Nighttime Flashback Strategies,"Can anyone share with me some useful strategies for coping with flashbacks at night. I find they come for me then and I end up silently crying for hours on end. Itâ€™s really effecting my sleep and my productivity the following day. 

Currently I use a mindfulness app with music that I try to focus on, but itâ€™s been lately ineffective."
CPTSD,Getting mad at my boyfriend has made me so much happier with him,"I can't fucking believe it. You're telling me getting upset with someone from time to time *doesn't* mean that they hate you now and actually it's your fault for overreacting and it's no big deal and it doesn't matter? It doesn't make them mad at you until you figure out why your anger was wrong? Sometimes your anger is justified and sometimes the person you're angry at might even apologize and understand why you're upset and change their behavior or compromise with you? What the fuck?

This is our second time dating. The first time, I was still stuck in the mindset of ""it doesn't matter if I'm upset, all that matters is that he's happy."" I hid so many little grievances I had, thinking they were so minor they didn't matter. I pretended to be fine while I had to turn away to hide that I was crying. I thought, well, I know he doesn't mean to upset me, so it's my fault that I'm upset. And all of these little things snowballed into one big thing until I dumped it all on him and then dumped him too.

And now, after a year of working on myself and learning how to be upset a normal amount and handle it normally by going through rough times with friends, we're back together. And I've made a point to really emphasize that I'm trying harder to communicate my needs better and I force myself to air out grievances as soon as I can so they can't fester. And I'm... happy. I'm so fucking happy. How can anger and sadness make you happy? I don't get it. I'm confused. But it's happening. It's true.

I've always felt physically safe with him. I know he would never intentionally hurt me and he's very clear that the only way he would ever use his imposing figure with me is to protect me. But now I feel emotionally safe too. Safe to speak my mind, be happy, be upset, be annoyed, be excited. I can trust that no matter what emotion it is, he'll try to understand it and support me. He's the only one in my life I feel this unwaveringly safe with. It's cathartic. And I feel so goddamn happy."
CPTSD,Idk why I do this to myself - no advice ty,"God I am so pathetic I can't allow myself any form of release. I keep typing and deleting because I can't express my emotions without telling myself that I'm a stupid bitch and to shut the fuck up. I am swimming in self-loathing. Fucking drowning in it because I cannot enjoy ANYTHING WITHOUT RUINING IT. 

I just want peace. Fuck all I want is some inner peace and I don't know how to express that the only way I have peace is if I'm left alone. I should be kept away from people. I should not be allowed to interact with people because I'm a fucking monster. 

I cannot be trusted and I make terrible choices. I feel like I have no control over my mind.

I don't want advice. I know. I've been told. Whatever you want to say lmao if you even got this far, idc. Idk why I'm still here."
CPTSD,How do you live with yourself if you have PTSD rage?,"The past year Iâ€™ve had three instances of PTSD rage. Fight and flight. Never had it before. This year I tragically lost my brother, unearthed past emotional/physical/sexual trauma, and found myself in a complex relationship. 

What kicked it off each time was a strong sense of pullback from someone I have a loving and very secure relationship with, yet thereâ€™s just enough room for questioning or lack of definition. When it felt like a big pullback into territory where maybe I had been mislead previously, I flipped. 

I yelled, swore, was verbally aggressive. Itâ€™s clear itâ€™s defense by offense as what I spout out are accusations my biggest fears along with what I know the other person would fear the most. Itâ€™s vile. That part of my psyche knows what itâ€™s like to be abused and hurt and knows how to dish it out too. 

I donâ€™t even remember it. Iâ€™m told about it later. I have a residual feeling of anger or confusion. Especially when I hear what happened. These are thoughts Iâ€™ve *never* had or said. Especially not to the person itâ€™s said too. 

Without fail, each time is later met with me breaking down into a crying, moaning mess. Iâ€™m a grown man begging not to be hurt, crawling into the corner to hide. It feels so much like something bad is happening. Like someone is about to burst through the door or is touching me. I canâ€™t crawl away from that sick feeling and I canâ€™t hide from whatever bad is coming. The perceived slight that triggered me feel like being molested, or hit, or like someone is dying, or the pain of losing my brother. Some combo of the worst things that happened to me. 

Iâ€™m so disgusted with this. I could deal with the breakdown part. But my lashing out is sickening. Iâ€™m truly hurting people with these words and ruining what little love Iâ€™ve found. I am a peaceful, loving person. I strive to make others feel secure. Then thereâ€™s this fucking demon that comes out and does the opposite. 

It doesnâ€™t even feel like I did this but I know I did. Iâ€™m responsible. But it feels like someone else came in, destroyed everything, then blamed me for it. I truly canâ€™t even remember it, which is disturbing all on its own. 

Iâ€™m trying so hard to not hate myself for this. I am fighting to not sequester myself from love. And honestly, Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself so I donâ€™t hurt anyone. I have no plans to do so and donâ€™t want to but Iâ€™d rather die than hurt someone else like this. Itâ€™s my problem to bury, not theirs. 

I know where this comes from. I was abused as a child. As an adult I was also treated terribly by people who said they loved me. Iâ€™ve never had a love that lasts or doesnâ€™t become abusive. My brain is broken when it comes to attachment. I search for signs of abandonment or manipulation. Then when someone flips an opinion theyâ€™re well within their right to flip, I see it as life or death. My brain defends me at all costs. Then it breaks down into a hurt child.  

I know others deal with this. How do you live with yourself knowing youâ€™ll hurt or chase away the ones you love the most without even knowing it? I canâ€™t even react because it happens without me knowing. 

Iâ€™m trying lamictal in hopes of preventing it. Iâ€™ve tried therapy but that is the person it comes out on. Iâ€™ll try trauma focused therapy next. Right now I just need to know how to cope with what Iâ€™ve done."
CPTSD,losing myself again,"i have been with my family of origin for about two weeks now, and things just get worse every day. i feel my boundaries being pushed and broken. i feel my parents trying to control me. but their voices are so influential to me right now that i shut myself down before i can believe my own instincts. i feel sick to my stomach. i really need to live on my own after college. i am so fed up with this. and i started smoking weed again to cope with the distress and my parents are both hounding me about itâ€”my dad assumes i am using his money to buy it and my mom is trying to make sure iâ€™m using it in moderation. i feel like her concern for me is a front. i feel like she lies to me more than i know. i donâ€™t know how to keep going like this for another week and a half. if anyone has bite-sized coping tips or even just kind and encouraging words that would be so so appreciated. i feel trapped, and like i am not living my own life, i am living through my parentsâ€™ eyes."
CPTSD,Is it worth reporting someone for child abuse 15 years later?,"I was abused by a older male when I was a teen. There was a lot of sexual coercion and manipulation. He was abusing several other young girls during the time that I thought we were in a relationship. I was 13-21 when this happened and now am 36. I didnâ€™t realize it was abuse until many years later. Now looking back, he was a serious predator. R Kelly type of shit. I have considered reporting these events to child protective services but havenâ€™t felt like the risks are worth it so far. Today, I found out that he is employed as an administrator at my sonâ€™s school. It really scares me that he could be around my kid and that I might have to deal with interacting with him. I am considering making a report of my abuse because he is still working with children and is in a position of power where he could prey on the vulnerable ones. Iâ€™m also a mandated reporter of child abuse in my state. Does anyone have experience with this and is it worth making a report this many years later?"
CPTSD,Being alive scares the shit out of me.,"Just the fact that anyone of us are breathing, living just as everyone before seriously is traumatizing in of itself but even more so the ones of us who have nearly died, sometimes on multiple occasions. That feeling you have with you 24/7 after not dying when your brain already flipped the switch...it's paralyzing...."
CPTSD,Have you found any value in getting an official diagnosis?,"I have been seeing a therapist for years and she said very early on that she thinks I'm experiencing cptsd but I have never actually gone to the doctor for an 'official' diagnosis.

I'm not in any doubt about having cptsd but I'm just not sure what I have to gain from going to the doctor about it. The process of getting the diagnosis is quite off-putting as well. I'm struggling at the moment and the idea of having to go in to details and talk about symptoms etc doesn't feel good.

Maybe because I'm struggling that's the exact reason I should be getting medical help? Who knows. Although I'm not sure what treatment is available

Has anyone got any experience of this, good or bad? Was a diagnosis helpful?

I'm UK based if that makes any difference.



TLDR: is it worth the hassle to get diagnosed by a doctor"
CPTSD,Done with dating,"I wish people would really listen when I say the healing required to sustain a long term relationship is not a small task. It's not a light one either. 
""Are you sure it won't be too much?"" ""Is this something you can realistically handle?"" ""Would it be too triggering?"" 
Then time goes on and oh they're overwhelmed or this and that. 
Do people not understand part of healing is going to bring those old emotions to the surface? And there's gotta be a commitment to working through it on both sides. It's not a process of rainbows. It's definitely not an overnight thing either.
But it's like why on earth do they get into these things knowing they'll be ready to give up or walk once it's a little too intense or maybe some of their own traumas surfaced and instead of addressing it, they want to do the ""I'll just put it behind me"". 
Drives me insane.

CPTSD,Nobody's going to love me,"Who wants to date a girl with all that trauma and health problems!? You're so worthless. How did you get double jeopardy in life? You're useless.

A science experiment. Just abusable."
CPTSD,No contact orders,"I had to go through the process recently to get a protective order against a parent, and my therapist had no clue how it works.

I feel it like a rock that is held from a rope and it's getting bigger with time, at some point today I cut my breath in the middle of thinking about what I can do with the staff that's troubles me.

What is the last choice?"
CPTSD,Anybody else deal with sleep disorders from your CPTSD,"Right after I'd finally escaped my abusive family and was experiencing the height of my CPTSD before getting treatment, I started sleepwalking, sleep-eating and having intense night terrors. The timing couldn't have been worse; I was at college living with roommates in dorms and apartments for the first time. I was staying the night with hook-ups and crashing at my brand new friends' places. All these new people got to witness my trauma.

  
One roommate despised me and chewed me out constantly for eating her food. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about and I truly meant it. Then one day she woke me up, standing over me in bed, angrily accusing me of having eaten the leftover Chicken Tikki Marsala she'd been looking forward to having. I denied eating it and told her off for accusing me, only for her to scream ""IT'S ALL OVER YOUR FACE"".

...Turns out it was, I had eaten it. I had been sleepwalking into the kitchen every night to rummage through the fridge. I had to start tying my leg to my bed to prevent myself from doing it (barely worked, I'd untie it in my sleep).

  
I woke up to people violently shaking me and yelling that I was having a nightmare more times than I can count. I'd be so startled, confused and annoyed, I'd have no memory of the dreams and had no clue why they were bothering me, but was told I'd shriek and sob things like ""HELP, NO, STOP, PLEASE, NO, I'M SORRY, DON'T"" while flailing in bed.

  
A few times I woke up to someone flipping on a light and staring at me in bewildered disgust, just to suddenly realize I'd apparently been standing in the dark bathroom in the middle of the night like a total creep for god knows how long.

  
The worst incident was when I'd crashed at an acquaintance's place. I'd been heavily drinking, hadn't slept in 48hrs and was messily crying, so he invited me to sleep it off in his bed while he sat at his PC and talked to friends over voicechat.

  
I vaguely remember a dream about threatening figures surrounding and taunting me, then me beckoning them closer like ""You wanna hurt me? I dare you, see what happens"" and then attacking them. I suddenly woke up in the hallway of this guy's building with him screaming at me to calm down while I, panicked, babbled about someone dangerous in his apartment, insisting we had to get out of there. He angrily showed me there was no one in his place. I was so confused, I couldn't figure out what was going on. He practically dragged me back to my place, pushed me towards my roommates and bolted.

  
A week later, I learned what had happened. I'd abruptly sat up in his bed, smiling eerily, and beckoned him to come closer. When he leaned in to humor me, I...just launched myself at him. His friends heard it all over voicechat, they described me screaming ""like a demon"". I'd managed to bite all the way through his leather jacket and broke the skin, then fled his apartment into the hallway, where he caught up and shook me awake.

  
All of my new friends at college suddenly thought I was a dangerous psycho and I was banned from entering people's homes. Everyone gossiped about the incident and shunned me, it was humiliating. I understand their fear, but at the same time, it was devastating to end up socially isolated at such a vulnerable point in time. It fed into my self-loathing, like ""Why am I such a crazy fucking freak, why am I like this??""

  
I'm much, much better these days, but last night I woke up standing in front of my microwave at 3am while it made HORRIBLE noises because I'd apparently tried to cook a metal cocoa tin in it for 10mins. Just when you think you're past it, something pops up.

  
Anybody else deal with trauma induced parasomnias?"
CPTSD,"People/places/food ""triggers"" health related trauma","Before I begin, I talk a lot about emotional and some animal abuse. I also briefly discuss self harm. I did not go into too much detail but just a heads up. 

I am 20F and I do not know if this is normal. I went through cancer from ages 17-20. I have had other traumatic things happen before though. I was emotionally abused by my father. I do not know if what he did should be considered emotional abuse, but Idk how else to put it. It started when I was 10-11. He would get irritated whenever I would disagree with him. However, when I was 13, he began to get violent. He killed my pet with a shot gun and I had to watch. He said I was a horrible daughter and that the pet had to die because I was a bad person. He would grab me, drag me down the stairs, and shook me around at a park. I am from a middle class family and he would always buy things for me, and then threaten to take them away whenever I did something wrong. For example, he bought me a car. However, I was talking to my mom one day and he came in and started shouting at me. He called me names and was yelling so I started to grab the car keys. He took them from me and said that since he paid for the car, I could not use it unless I apologize. He made me give up other items as well, such as my phone. I ended up apologizing. I used self harm as a coping mechanism, and when he saw my scars, he said they weren't deep enough to be concerning. He never took my side and was always pitting me against my peers. He commented a lot on my weight and looks to the point where I developed an eating disorder. But this is all besides the point. I was diagnosed with cancer when I graduated high school. 

Cancer was very hard for me. I felt like the worst case scenario always ended up happening. I was dating a guy at the time. A family friend. He became my main line of support as my friends were withdrawn and my family was so emotionally draining that I could not open up to them. My mom got mad that I was crying, and my dad would say how much of a loser I was because I was not doing well in my classes. I continued working, school, and dealing with life. My boyfriend broke up with me because it was too much, however, he would still text me. I wanted him to stop, but if I made him stop, I would not have anyone. Plus, I was always put down whenever I set boundaries and, combined with my introverted nature, I truly struggle setting boundaries. Sometimes he would unleash his frustrations on me, and I sorta just took it. We eventually stopped communicating. I also would visit certain places while going through cancer and would eat only a limited amount of stuff. It was a very dark time. I actually struggle articulating how truly mentally tormenting that was. Abandoned, but yet not abandoned, while going through cancer. 

My struggle is, that now that it is mostly over, certain things will send me back to that poor 19 year old who was dumped and abused while going through cancer. Unfortunaly, my ex is a family friend, so I have to see him a lot.  Whenever I do see him, it is not an awkward encounter at all, rather, it sends me back to when I was helpless and how he treated me. So its not so much awkward, rather emotionally stressful. Holidays make me sad, because I was attempting to end my life New Year's 2023.  Whenever I see my family (which is a lot because I live with them) it brings back a lot of pain. I will be making a lot of progress and then I go to certain place, am served a certain thing, or see a certain person and will get sent back to that same mindset, with the same feelings, and same impending feeling of doom. I don't know what to do, I cannot afford treatment for this ""trauma"" and it is really affecting my quality of life. I feel like I am constantly ""on guard"" and looking over my should everywhere I go. Almost like I am expecting something bad to happen. I posted my story on r/stories and was referred here so I am here. I had to go see my ex again today, and I have to schedule a scan to make sure I am still cancer free and I am slipping back to 2022/2023 and I am sorta sad rn. "

CPTSD,Seeking cPTSD therapist recs in Atlanta,"Iâ€™ve gone through two therapists in the last year :

1) primarily used CBT and helped me uncover my childhood trauma but victim blamed me in our last session which sent me into a month-long emotional flashback
2) primarily used EMDR but just wasnâ€™t compassionate or validating, and provided no guidance during sessions. I never walked out of a session feeling better.

Both seemed like good fits before I started actually working with him. No red flags until some sessions in.

Iâ€™ve interviewed dozens of therapists and I canâ€™t seem to find any â€œgood enoughâ€ ones for trauma work. I feel as if I ask all the right questions, but I really donâ€™t know until you get a few sessions into it. I have been scouring all the websites, trying to even find reviews, but itâ€™s like a needle in a hay stack. Does anyone have actual experience with someone in atlanta or who is US based and can accept GA residents virtually? Open to self pay, in person or online, and any modalities.

CPTSD,Communicating & healing from abuse,"Tw: self harm mention (brief) & discussion/reflection on emotional abuse

I'm in a new relationship - my boyfriend is really, really sweet. I've given him the rundown on my past with my mental health, and he took it all very well. I've been solid in recovery from self harm (among other things) for a while now, but it still does have an impact on me from time to time, and it's also been a big part of my life that I wanted him to know.

Today he sent me this clip to watch, and there was a self harm joke in the middle. It wasn't the central focus, and it wasn't offensive, either, but it certainly caught me off guard. Being home for the holidays has made me struggle a bit more with my recovery, and again, although it wasn't offensive, it also probably wasn't something I needed to see.

I first sat with it and thought about whether I should say something. I really believe communication is important in a relationship, and from past experiences, I've started to solidify this idea that not communicating cheats both of us out of what we want.

I was shaking, crying a bit, but I did it. I swallowed my initial thoughts and fears and let him know how I felt.

And he reacted so well. He apologized, and - I think what helps the most - is that he was able to do so without centering the conversation on *his* guilt. Because yeah, I'm sure he feels a little guilty about it, but whether its a result of the abuse, or the behavior itself is abusive, I have put so much energy & fear into this idea that my emotions matter less than others, and that I shouldn't put people in a situation where they're going to feel guilty.

He also solidly told me he appreciates how communicative I am - not just in a ""thanks for telling me"" type of way, but in a genuine ""i am glad you trust me to tell me these things and i want to know these things."" The way he phrased it to me just really emphasized how he actually cared to hear it. It's really affirming for me, and honestly I cried, again, but this time in a positive way, like ""wow I love him so much and i really appreciate him"" 

Abuse has made communicating my feelings so hard, and it's nice to be able to find someone who *wants* to hear about how I feel, who *cares* about how I feel, and *encourages* me to do so, without making me feel like I have hurt them by bringing it up. It's really... nice. I can't describe it. I just wanted to let this out."
CPTSD,Angry and Hopelessâ€”please respond!,"I feel angry, hopeless and terrified and really alone.  I donâ€™t see a future for myself.  I was working as a nanny for 6 years and then couldnâ€™t find work so Iâ€™ve been unemployed since September and on EI.  I have one interview this Thursday but thatâ€™s itâ€¦after applying to so many jobs.  I donâ€™t think I even want to nanny anymore.  Iâ€™m 52 and I just feel Iâ€™ve outgrown it.  Itâ€™s not stable work and I have not been able to save.  The last 2 years have been flashback hellâ€”tons of excruciating emotional pain.  I have been underemployed and unemployed at times.  I have been just barely getting by and racking up debt on my credit card.

  Iâ€™ve done a lot of healing work and think Iâ€™ve finally have gotten to a better placeâ€” I still struggle with  flashbacks all the time but they seem to be getting less intense.  Iâ€™ve been at home completely alone for the last 4 months.  Mostly self-care.

What I really want to do is be self-employed and work from home.  I have the beginnings of a life coaching business but I donâ€™t have the time to build it.  Iâ€™ve been doing a little here and there in the last few weeks since I started feeling a little better.  I think my EI will run out within the next 5 or 6 months and by then I would be totally broke.  No savings and credit card to the max.

Nannying really holds no hope for my future and I donâ€™t see how I could get a thriving business going in the next few months.  

Iâ€™m just so frigging infuriated right now!!!!!!  Have I done all this healing work for nothing?  Is this where everything goes to shit?  I kept hoping for a miracle or something but there isnâ€™t one.  Sometimes I feel a little inspiration and hope.  I mean I know I could make this business happen.  I just need more time! I AM WORTHY OF FLOURISHING, DAMN IT!!!!!!!!!

Sorry that was a little longer than I meant it to be.  Please respond with empathy and validation."
CPTSD,Is healing a destination or a journey?,"Thereâ€™s a lot of talk in the spiritual communities as well about being â€œhealedâ€. 

Some of them say nobody is ever â€œhealedâ€ but healing.

Some say healing is discovering what you define as healing and achieving that.

Some make it as if one day you are simply healed and itâ€™s all gone.

What do you all think?"
CPTSD,Anyone else have trouble feeling emotions appropriately?,Iâ€™ve struggled since I got away from the trauma with feeling emotional reactions to things. Itâ€™s something I havenâ€™t been able to pinpoint and the furthest Iâ€™ve gotten is realizing I dissociated EVERY SINGLE TIME an emotion needs to be felt. The biggest struggle is when people tell me bad things. Whenever someone tells me some negative news for example â€œhey my dog just died and Iâ€™m super sadâ€ itâ€™s like a shockwave goes through my body and all the sudden I just dissociated and genuinely canâ€™t find anything to feel itâ€™s just nothingness. It happens In seconds too like literally instantaneous between the time they finish the sentence and the time Iâ€™m expected to respond. Itâ€™s really frustrating and honestly I feel like the only time I feel emotions is when Iâ€™m alone. Can barely cry in front of others or share an emotional experience but on the regular I just cry when Iâ€™m alone and it happens at the most inconvenient times like for example I literally just like cried on the way home from class a few weeks ago got done by the time I got to my parking lot and just moved on with my day. The emotional numbing also causes significant stress on my life because people get mad at me for being unemotional and it makes me feel like something is wrong with me
CPTSD,my sketchy psychologist who sucks helped me realize i have c-ptsd,"I've recently been taking meds for ADHD and depression and shit which I was diagnosed with and never treated for growing up, and so my parents finally let me see a psychologist to get them (admittedly he's kind of... yeah.) Recently I had to get a letter written by him for my college's ESA approval, and they wrote in the letter that one of the things I needed it for was PTSD. I was like ""???"" and asked why they put PTSD on it and they said they just put it down for the trauma from my pet dying from a medical incident in the previous year. And I was like ""uh okay dude"". Like I barely mentioned this at all and this is the first time I'm hearing I have PTSD from it but okay dude. And then he ended our 15 minute meeting and let me go. Tbh I should change psychologists but I have no clue how to handle that... my parents basically take over half my life.

What struck me though was that the whole time during the conversation I wasn't thinking about my pet, I was thinking about how I literally haven't told the psychologist about my family at all and how could they possibly know anything about that. And then I was like why am I even thinking about my family in the first place lol. I mean they suck but they don't suck THAT much. And I don't even have any signs of PTSD as far as I know. I'm pretty sure. Well long story short I did a bunch of internet rabbit hole google searching and then I came here and started crying without even realizing it after reading all the posts. And now my therapist has basically confirmed in our past couple of meetings that I've definitely been emotionally and physically abused. Like... severely.

So I guess thanks to this subreddit and thanks to my psychologist who sucks lol. But seriously I'm grateful that this community exists, I was taught that PTSD was a thing that only happened to people with ""extreme"" childhoods and that my childhood wasn't that ""extreme"" because I grew up in the most Sunday church clothes suburbs ever. But now I'm realizing that half of the things that make up my identity and all my ""quirks"" that I felt like just came out of nowhere actually have a reason now. Like I have a reason for why I feel so detached from people, and why I constantly beat myself up for every little mistake, and why I get what I didn't realize were panic attacks when I think people are getting frustrated with me and shit. It's really eye-opening."
CPTSD,Therapy for complex trauma,"I went to therapy for the first time a few years back and was sure it was all bullshit.  I didnâ€™t really believe I had complex PTSD when he diagnosed meâ€¦till I read the symptoms. Yep. Checked all the boxes.  
This therapist listened to my whole story. Things I had never been able to say to myself let alone another living soul.  He made me feel more seen, heard, and valued than any other human I have ever knownâ€¦until he didnâ€™t. He told me several massive lies about his life and would gaslight me. When I finally confronted him he responded by discarding me and going on a smear campaign.
If youâ€™re like me youâ€™re guarded with new people. But once theyâ€™re in will stay in relationship to your detriment trying to prove worth. 
There has been something so insidious about being coaxed into handing over your wounds to someone who promises they are going to help clean up those wounds only to then use your pain to wipe their feet with. It has reinforced every abusive word I ever heard. 
I was actually functioning ok-ish when I entered therapy and now I feel so cynical and hopelessâ€¦
Can you ever trust anyone???"
CPTSD,Embarrassed myself in public,"I was on a date with my girlfriend, and I felt like everything went perfect since we've started working on ways to help make me more comfortable in public. Then, after my longest shopping experience with no anxiety/meltdowns, I completely shut down when she jokingly locked me out of her car. Suddenly I had an overwhelming feeling of rejection, which turned to genuine fear she was going to ditch me, then anger that she'd ""betray"" me like this. 

Mentally, I was experiencing a horrible tantrum, but physically I had just shut down. I walked away from the car and I got a good distance away before she was able to reach me and made me get back in the car. I snapped out of that shut down state when she was telling me how scared she was for my safety and that she was sorry. I apologized as well that same car ride, but it still bugs me the fact I did that. It's not the first time I've embarrassed myself in front of my girlfriend with my meltdowns and weird ""moments"", but this is even worse as it happened in public. I wouldn't care if I was having mental meltdowns alone, but the fact my girlfriend, and I guess the public now, are witnesses to that is so embarrassing and I feel guilty."
CPTSD,Questioning â€˜assaultâ€™,"When I was 17 I had an older male who I had known for around 2 years, lead me away from the main party, into a bush and at the time I believed he wanted to kiss (which I would have consented to). He then pushed the top of my head down which required some force as I wasnâ€™t understanding what he wanted and didnâ€™t want to do this. He then said â€œgive me headâ€. And then I did give him oral sex. He then said â€œthanksâ€ and walked off and Left me there. I then had to walk to a friends house which was quite far away, in the dark. I was so drunk that I kept falling to my knees every few steps, and my knees were scraped up. This event has affected my self-worth and self-esteem so much. I feel sick and shakey when I recall it. He contacted me via Facebook messenger to apologise for his actions. I am deeply humiliated by it all, and so so angry. BUT I donâ€™t know whether this could be considered sexual assault as I didnâ€™t fight back in any way, although I knew and know that I had absolutely no desire or want to do that sexual act, and I felt totally degraded (which I am sure was what he wanted). Itâ€™s this factor that holds me back from seeking support. That people would think well, you didnâ€™t say no. I could have walked away. He was also my sisters ex boyfriend. Is this a sexual assault? I have had a â€˜fawnâ€™ response to many many serious situations since then. I want to be a fighter not freeze but it doesnâ€™t come naturally."
CPTSD,Therapists dilemma,"Hi so I was working with a therapist thatâ€™s also a systemic therapist and we parted ways for now because she felt like it was difficult to be and my therapist and also work as a systemic therapist with my family for example.

Which I understood so now I only meet her when I have therapy with other people and have a new therapist that I meet weekly.

I notice I struggle a lot with this change and I feel like I was feeling a lot better when I did my work with her and donâ€™t really feel like this new therapist is really doing it for me. 

I tried to bring it up in a group talk but I was too afraid to stand up for myself. She mentioned itâ€™s better and probably also more helpful for me long term but Iâ€™m kinda doubtful since I donâ€™t really have that many systemic therapy sessions and probably wonâ€™t have unless my partner and I would do more. I donâ€™t really see my family participating in these sessions long term. 


Idk if I should give the new therapist a longer chance or bring up this issue again and perhaps find a different solution for the systemic part.


Any advice is welcome"
CPTSD,Boundaries,"Boundaries

How would you adress disrespectful family in-law members. I am very shy and have a low self esteem. Would love some one liners (not rude) or scripts that I can memorize and have ready and say at a drop of a hat."
CPTSD,"CPTSD, not just PTSD","Whenever I mention my diagnosis â€˜CPTSDâ€™ to a doctor, a psychologist, at the municipality, wherever, they always write â€˜PTSDâ€™ in their papers. It starts to annoy me cause I clearly say â€˜CPTSDâ€™ and a few times Iâ€™ve even corrected them. Still the outcome is â€˜PTSDâ€™ in their papers as if they have a problem acknowledging that itâ€™s more than that!"
CPTSD,"This awful way that I never learned to make anything simply easier for myself, or extend any patience, understanding, kindness. Everything had to be so callous, and terrifying, when it didn't' need to be that way.","I was watching a video my partner showed me of a family getting a bath ready for their beagle puppy.  This was adorable, my partner is so awesome.   Here's this colorful, cute tiny little blowup pool, this adorable beagle puppy, maybe 8 weeks-12 weeks old.  They start throwing in these toys, my heart is melting.  First a rubber duck, then a little colorful ball, a tiny little ship, ....then some treats....you get the idea.   It's all fun and cute, and a small 4 year old girl is standing by , helping, in her pink tutu.  They gently lift the puppy in the pool, he's eating the treats, he's having his little head scritched with soap, and it's this great thing.

Then I was thinking about how nothing was done to help me alleviate my fears, nothing.  Just ""stop being afraid...nothing to be afraid about"".   I do this to myself\*-Now\*!?   It's like throwing someone in a pool that doesn't' know how to swim, and shouting ""okay, SWIM!""

I was afraid of everything growing up, which I think is pretty natural.  But probably more afraid,  having come from what I came from, so much danger, etc.   So fear would have been pretty normal.  But zero help with that.  Just shoving you into situations , before  you're ready.

I really need to remember this the next time I'm chastising myself for being a baby, and saying ""just get over it"".

And remembering so many things like this.  Watching that video was , idk, shocking?  Like there's a world like this, where people help other beings, people, with their fear.   I think I'm still stunned that this is a thing?

I was afraid of the dark when I was small.   No  help, just ""go to sleep"", close the door.  No nightlight, not even think to leave the door ajar, and put the hallway light on,...nothing.   Now I have nightlights that change color , in almost every room of the house, out of spite, and because I like them.

but what really worries me , is sometimes I can't think of a way to make something easier, not only for myself, but for  others.  I""m not trying to be callous, I tend to just default to ""Oh, you'll be okay"".   I hate that, I don't want to be like that.  I want to be the person who's getting the toys, making little post it stickers-with sparkle pens,  sending loving supportive colorful animated texts, sending fun cards, tying balloons and shit to stuff to help people remember things.   I got none of that growing up.   It never occurs to me, to make things easier, not for myself, and not for others.   It's all just ""just do it, stop being a baby, "".

But I don't' think that's just me?  I've been seeing this dentist, and told him I have anxiety, he's not callous, just sort of indifferent-which come to think of it, is callous=indifference?   I told him I was nervous, and he was like  ""Oh, okay, well you'll be okay"".   My thought is, ""thats it?""  So I guess it's okay that he's a top notch dentist, and not my therapist. So I might bring a weighted blanket and maybe put a stuffy in my purse.   What's that saying about not expecting the entire world to be carpeted , so wear slippers??.   :)

But tbh, this really breaks my heart, it made me so sad to see that video.   This little puppy is getting more emotional care for his tender feelings than I got.   I was sort of dragged, and pushed and shamed into doing stuff.    ""Oh, you're afraid?   that's nothing, forget it"".     I have this distinct memory of my mother holding my hand, when I was 4, and feeling nothing from her.  No warmth, tenderness, nothing.    Like I might as well have been a rag doll, and I felt like one.  Jasmin Lee Cori talks about this in her book ""The Emotionally Absent Mother"".  About feeling no warmth from someone, the quote ""they look like the Sun, but cold, no warmth"".   

I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting  to make things easier, and more accommodating for yourself, for your trauma, for how you struggle with everything.   Never mind, oh, ""I shouldn't be struggling with this much"".   Screw the judgement, start putting up balloons and sparkly glow shit to deal with the pervasive struggle with .....everything.  If not that, made to order accommodations for your pain and fear.....obviously for  your CPTSD.

The crazy thing is that had I just had carefully attentive parents, to provide a fraction of accommodations, and sensitivity for my emotions, I wouldn't now need;  therapy, weighted blankets, fucking mantras,  pre-emptive scripts and narratives for every contingency, because I have no internal coping mechanism layered with years of rubber ducks, night lights, soft spoken conversations, creative and funny narratives to help me manage the unknown.  All I have is the terror, and the memory of being shoved into situations before I was ready....with zero understanding.

It took me years to figure out that I needed to get up 2 and half hours before I had to be at work, just to prepare my nervous system.   Before that I gave myself 20 minutes, while I sped down the road, hair wet, frantic, ....I had no clue.   This is how I grew up.   No preparation, nothing, ""we're doing this, be ready"" or ""we're leaving NOW"".  Never tell you the day before, never help you figure out how to prepare, no conversation, I swear it was intentional just to watch you freak out.

When I contemplate  what I  need to heal my  wounds;    all the patience I can fathom, all the understanding I can muster, all the kindness I can envision. ......then I should triple it."
CPTSD,Anyone tried hypnosis to recover memories?,"Has anyone tried hypnotherapy to recover traumatic memories? Iâ€™m curious if anyone has tried this for the purpose of processing and healing.

CPTSD,Anger,"TW: sexual trauma (no detail! Just asking for advice relating to anger) 

I was in a sexually abusive relationship nearly six year ago (Im 21, F). I've avoided processing it post-police report and was kind of forced into it due to an update i received last year. I'm now dealing with intense anger. Partly at myself, but mainly him. Especially him. What does this mean and is this a good thing? Is it part of the healing or am I going backwards? I wish I never had to feel this anger."
CPTSD,Neutralize soap smell?,"So, I got a bottle of free body wash and used it for the first time today. I got triggered when I first smelled it, but I was like ""Don't be a pansy, Self!"" So it wasn't until my whole body was lathered in it that I was like ""O shit"" and spent literally two hours hyperventilating uncontrollably. I thought the hell would never go away! I sprayed a ton of body spray, used conditioner, etc, but every so often the smell of the stupid bottle of body wash comes back and I'm back in XYZ messed up situation. Is there something that can neutralize that smell? I'm thinking I might just have to turn the thermostat way up and sweat it out lol. My turtle's tank needs cleaning as well so maybe I could get some swamp water on myself or something and that would get rid of it enough that I could just bathe again with a different soap. But IDK what the molecular properties are of the offending scent or what would break it down on a chemical level. All I know is I hate flashbacks!!"
CPTSD,Slowly Healing. But still not quite there.,"To make a long story short, I grew up in a very volatile household. Iâ€™m gay, non-binary and autistic. Father was physically abusive to my siblings and I. Mother SAâ€™d me for years as a kid, and then later as an adult, which has just recently been brought to light in therapy. I have had a full psychotic break since then, and am now on medication to deal with the hallucinations and delusions that make me feel like Iâ€™m the bad person. Itâ€™s been very hard. The world didnâ€™t feel safe there for a while, but Iâ€™m trying hard to heal from all this trauma. To be betrayed by anyone is hard, but to have it be by your own parents is another story. Iâ€™m trying everyday to heal from it, but it isnâ€™t easy. Anyone been through something similar?"
CPTSD,"Does EMDR work if you have CPTSD than PTSD, like if there is no one big trauma but hundreds of small ones since childhood?","I've been reading about EMDR and it seems to be created for PTSD, to help people gradually process some huge trauma like a car accident or rape that is very specific and associated with a vivid memory and sensation.

I feel a world of difference being with someone who is trauma trained vs my first therapist who used CBT and that made me feel like shit all the time. I genuinely feel from the few sessions Iâ€™ve had so far with the trauma therapist that this could be the path which helps me. And now Iâ€™m just too tired. Not just body and mind. Itâ€™s like my soul is worn out. I donâ€™t have the energy or even the desire to do this, and I donâ€™t have any hope for things actually improving in the world around me enough to maintain any progress I make. Iâ€™m also potentially scared of things changing but I donâ€™t really wanna know for sure if thatâ€™s where the feeling of fear is coming from. I donâ€™t really need advice, I genuinely feel I may just have to stop here, atleast for a while.

i am 17 & i live with my abusive mum and my two brothers. my mum has always treated me differently from my brothers r, especially the oldest one. she has been emotionally abusive and mentally abusive towards me, and also physically abusive and i generally just feel extremely unsafe at home, very unhappy and right now as iâ€™m typing this iâ€™m getting increasingly anxious as iâ€™m essentially recalling all the harmful things she does to me. i am struggling a lot right now & have been since iâ€™ve been on christmas break. i always struggle during the holidays /breaks because iâ€™m at home for longer than i want to be. i quite frankly hate living here. when iâ€™m at school i have my friends and i also have weekly therapy which i recently started. i have been trying to leave the house more often this break because i know itâ€™ll be good for me, but when iâ€™m back home it just weighs on my heart that this is my life. i dread every interaction with her even the minor â€˜helloâ€™ and â€˜how was your dayâ€™ at the end of last month she did this family discussion thing sheâ€™s been doing for a while, where she calls everyone to essentially say how she was unhappy with us this year, how sheâ€™s struggling & feels like nobody cares about her and how next year will be *much much better*! she made the assertion that the issue is that we as a family donâ€™t communicate enough, as this discussion happens yearly and she often tells me iâ€™m not good enough (which she did this year again) and that i need to change next year or else (which younger me made a dedication to doing, because i thought i was the reason she treated me so horribly), i was really happy to hear it because i thought she would finally recognise her abusive behaviour and apologise to me for it, and this would actually be a change in my life and our relationship. she didnâ€™t acknowledge her behaviours which made it difficult to communicate, she didnâ€™t acknowledge that years and years of abuse made it so i didnâ€™t wanna be in the same room with her for longer than two minutes. 
i think that is one of the things i am struggling with the most right now. the guilt and like shame of feeling like a bad daughter because i donâ€™t have a good relationship with her.
i did not choose this for myself and i can understand that but i do not feel it.
basically idk i guess i wanna vent. i am feeling the brunt of not being with the support of my counsellor and i feel uncomfortable talking to my friends about the abuse suse sometimes. i would really love some advice or help from brooke who have experienced this and who are idk in a better place. or just words of kindness. the self help and affirmations arenâ€™t rlly sticking w me rn.

CPTSD,Anyone else struggle with internalizing and punishing yourself?,"Okay so I'm going to try to be brief about this cuz I find that I lose the context when I try to explain this experience if I over explain it.
When I was younger if I was put down by my dad and to be clear he was pretty harsh and abusive at times.
I would internalize my feelings and become passive-aggressive and see myself as inadequate or broken. 
Imagine scenarios where I'd run away essentially it was almost as if I would imagine scenarios where I was putting myself into dangerous situations like I would think about wanting to drink and run away and become dysfunctional to get back at them if that makes sense. 
It was never like direct self harm I didn't want to die or anything like that it was more so like if they seen me in distress maybe then they would care because I'm never enough.


I'm an adult now but what I've discovered is those reactions have not left even when the people in my life have changed. 
I now have this tendency to overanalyze or suddenly just become super reactive to something my partner will say for example and it's the same exact reaction I start thinking that I need to be mad at myself or like I need to punish myself or alienate myself from others and just soak in the anger essentially it's as if they can see me and how fragile and broken I am then maybe they will actually feel sorry for me. 
I have gotten a little better with this but I noticed that this reactive like experience manifests itself randomly.
I just get really reactive and I suddenly have this whole experience like what I described above does anybody relate with this or understand it?"
CPTSD,Made the mistake of looking up my abuserâ€™s family on Facebook after many years,"Just a rant. Maybe some of you can relate to this deep inequality and unfairness of life when being a victim of abuse.

He was my step-dad. Abuse was consistent over many years and came in all shapes and sizes. He was a real life monster.

Every once in a while I look him up to try and find an obituary. No luck. I got too curious and tried to see how his psychopathic family was doing. They are good looking people with a lot of money (except my abuser, heâ€™s an ugly pig). He has a new wife, with two young daughters. I tried to warn her via messaging many years ago of what he did to me, she never responded/didnâ€™t seem to care.

Theyâ€™re going on all of these extravagant trips, eating out all of the time, own a beautiful home, her daughter gets to go to university. His mother died and left behind a huge inheritance, leaving him even richer. I never went to university because my mom had to leave my abuser, we had no money. My abuser has so many friends who have no idea of the truth.

My family is dirt poor. Never get to travel outside the country. Canâ€™t afford to eat out. No friends at all. Deep loneliness. Iâ€™m probably going to rent for life. Still struggling deeply with the after affects of his abuse, even a decade and a half later.

Life is a cruel joke. He should be the one suffering. Instead he and his fucked up family are living lavishly as if nothing ever happened. And my family is left to suffer. I just went ahead and finally blocked them all so I donâ€™t make the mistake of looking them up again. I will remember this and carry it with me though. I will use it to fuel my progress and make sure if they ever somehow come across me again, they will be shocked at how far I came despite their attempts to destroy my life.

I canâ€™t wait for the day when I do eventually see his obituary."
CPTSD,Iâ€™m a chameleon and I donâ€™t know who I am,"My childhood was spent adapting my personality to fit the expectations of others and avoid getting hurt. So now Iâ€™m in my 30s and feel like I donâ€™t know what my true personality is. 

I struggle to feel like I belong and so I adapt my likes dislikes beliefs you name it to the group Iâ€™m with. I donâ€™t even know what I like or donâ€™t like. Itâ€™s become such a problem that I put aside my own needs to be a people pleaser. 

My therapist pointed out that how I operate is: 
I have to make everyone around me happy. If theyâ€™re happy, Iâ€™m safe.

CPTSD,Living with my parents as an adult.,"I moved back in with my parents a year and a half ago and I've been long over it.

I get constant judgments on my appearance and dress (my mom told me my shirt didn't fit me when I was literally wearing a crop top.) I had to move back here after losing jobs due to C/PTSD and long covid but I'm mocked when I'm symptomatic for any of it and my dad admitted to making a decision even though he knew it would trigger me. I just don't know where I'm supposed to go but I can't do this forever."
CPTSD,Traumatic memory and feeling valid,"Recently I came across a section in a book about dissociation and relational trauma, written in Norwegian, where they discussed traumatic memory. As someone who doesn't remember the CSA that I factually know happened to me, I struggle a lot with feeling whether my trauma responses are valid. I was interviewed by social services about this as a child and all I did was shake my head. If something really happened, why didn't I speak up when I was given the chance? When my older sister blatantly did?

Well, as I came across this segment it almost made sense. The authors referred to a Swedish study from the 1990s, where they interviewed children who had been abused for child pornography. The children didn't remember the abuse happening. Even when shown photographic evidence of themselves being abused, they denied it ever happened and said they didn't remember. Only after repeated exposure and opportunity to speak did they start to open up about it.

And that made me think... maybe I never remembered it happening. Maybe I suppressed it immediately. Maybe it only happened once or a few times and I could just tuck it away. Even if it happened more often over more time, maybe I denied that part of my reality so completely it wasn't real. Even now I have no memory of it, not beyond vague sensations in particular circumstances.

Anyway. I just wanted to share, in case someone else out there struggles with memory and feeling valid. There's research that indicates we're not wrong and we're not liars.

CPTSD,Is it normal to feel worse after leaving a toxic home?,"So I did a post a few days ago venting about my experiences over the last few years, and how I took care of my grandmother over the pandemic as she succumbed to Parkinsonâ€™s, as well as dealing with my OCD. I was able to leave that house for school and moved in with my partner, and while some things feel better, other things donâ€™t and Iâ€™m not sure why.

I understand that many people discuss how after leaving a toxic/unhealthy living situation, your brain can switch off survival mode and you can actually begin to process your trauma and grief. I just want to know if anyone else has had any similar experiences and what they did to encourage the healing process. Iâ€™m just tired of being exhausted and depressed all the time and would like some help, or even just to be heard. Thank you."
CPTSD,Could never feeling financially secure be considered a symptom?,"I've been struggling with these feelings so much, I'm always trying to cut costs, feeling conflicted about buying stuff I want in an unhealthy manner, for example, everything is ok, I'm paying my bills, have some money for emergencies and I have some extra money, I want to buy an electric guitar and I'm super excited but them I have those feelings that something bad will happen and I'm gonna need the money, I think ""What the hell I'm thinking about? I need to save money because my parents are chaotic and crazy"""
CPTSD,Generational Trauma,"Maybe it's too soon for me (16) to be thinking about this. But I've been wondering if I should have kids or even get into a relationship in the future.

I'd love to have kids, to be able to love them and raise someone to live a happy life. But I'm scared I'll fuck it up somehow.

All my life I've been mentally neglected. Isolated from outside contact for 6 years now. Been depressed for as long as I can remember, my oldest memory being a suicide attempt when I was 7. I was beaten and bruised and my blood was shed a decent amount.

I don't think my family knew how much this would fuck me up. I don't think they know now even. They were raised beaten and neglected too (albeit not hidden away from the outside world for years but still).

I want to love someone, I want to feel loved dammit. But I'd rather die than hurt anyone for my own pleasure.

God knows how many times I've done that already..."
CPTSD,"At 37, realizing I donâ€™t know how to do anything successful when it comes to my emotions"," I truly cannot figure out what sitting with uncomfortable emotions means, Iâ€™ve read so much advice and pointers but it always fully backfires. Every single time I try to do this it absolutely does NOT make me feel better, it renders me completely useless: late to work or calling in, not being able to drive because Iâ€™m hysterical while I â€œfeel my feelingsâ€, physically throwing up and/or diarrhea, hyperventilating, and then almost always ends with extreme feelings of suicide. Logically the practice makes sense, but even the simplest moments of discomfort destroy me if I try to sit with it and feel it.   
   
   For example, today it was my fiancÃ©s tone changing and then acting distant right before he went to work that made me uncomfortable, clearly not a big deal and could certainly be unrelated to me. Either way it made me feel panicked and shitty so I decided to sit with it so I would feel better. It made everything so much worse and Iâ€™ve spiraled to a point of wanting to self harm. If I had just ignored it, Iâ€™d be at work functioning like a real normal adult.   
   
   WHATS THE POINT OF THIS? Itâ€™s like every fiber in my being is focused and concentrated on healing and taking care of myselfâ€¦ yet Iâ€™m only getting worse and less convinced thereâ€™s any reason to be alive. Whatâ€™s the point of healing if it leads you to suicide? Iâ€™ve never felt so hopeless in my life, literally what is the point of healing if you end up dying

CPTSD,Did you experienced psychosomatic pain or illness because of cptsd?,"Iâ€™m now having therapy on my symptoms. I really thought I was physically sick. But, everything looked normal when I went to my gp. Iâ€™ll go to a specialist incase I think. However, I had some intense therapy session on my fears and, now I feel very well physically compared to before. I donâ€™t have much pain or complaints. 
Did anyone else experienced that?"
CPTSD,Am I a cold hearted wench?,"Please be gentle with your responses because I already feel bad for how I feel.

A â€˜friendâ€™ of mines mother has passed away. She was a lovely woman, she gave me a purse for my birthday years ago that I still use now. They are a wonderful family, and we were all very close at one point. They made me feel loved and included always. 

However, in recent years I have distanced myself from everyone,(to prevent further trauma so I can heal the wounds I already have) and literally only speak to them when I bump into them which is rarely simply because I donâ€™t go anywhere except home and work and to buy food. 

I saw several posts on social media of her passing and didnâ€™t say anything, she messaged me directly to let me know she passed and I gave my condolences, and thought that was that. Sheâ€™s just invited me to the funeral and desperately donâ€™t want to go. 

Displays of emotion make me entirely uncomfortable, I wonâ€™t know anyone there (it will mainly be their family and friends from Sri Lanka) also I donâ€™t know culturally what will be expected of me and donâ€™t want to offend anyone on such an already sad day. 

Am I being a complete bitch? Should I feel honoured to be invited? Iâ€™ve never been to a funeral of a non-relative before and the last family member of mine to pass was 12 years ago. So I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s common practice to invite non relatives. I feel bad that Iâ€™m being a selfish prick ðŸ˜­

Happy new year everyone ðŸ¥²"
CPTSD,Partner cried for me,"I dont understand how he can feel more strongly about my trauma than I do. 

Has anyone else experienced similar? Partner, friend, other loved one crying for what happened to you while you're just...there?"
CPTSD,Is there such thing as healthy relationships?,"Are other people as dangerous as your abusers?

Out of interest, have any of you escaped your abusers and formed new relationships and friendships? Were they abusive, untrust worthy or did you find the majority of people you met outside of yout abusive family were actually decent human beins who valued and accepted you as you are?"
CPTSD,Why does it hurt so bad.,"Iâ€™ve posted here and another subreddit on abusive relationships for the past couple of months on a throwaway account. 

I guess whatâ€™s happening isnâ€™t important really.

Everything just hurts. My heart hurts so bad.  I feel an ache in my chest and sharp electric pangs like feelings in my arms. My head hurts and I have serious nausea. Mu body is so tense.
Iâ€™m so confused and I donâ€™t know what I want. I need someone to hold me and talk to me. I canâ€™t handle this much longer and Iâ€™m so tired. 

I wish I could have one person that I could truly feel comfortable being myself with no expectations. I know thatâ€™s unrealistic. 

I just want to stop hurting so bad."
CPTSD,Fight and flight info,"Hi, I'm looking for recommendations on articles, books, papers, etc on the neuroscience and ways of getting out of specifically flight and fight as a trauma response, I know about the polyvagal theory but I wanna go more in depth about deactivation strategies to get to regulation, I would be really grateful if someone can lmk about something that they read or that was helpful for them to get out of this responses, thanks!"
CPTSD,How do you manage while running on near zero?,"Iâ€™m in that limbo phase. I want to get a job, car and all that but Iâ€™m still disabled and still finding it difficult to manage triggersâ€” the more sinister subconscious ones that go unnoticed usually. Itâ€™s getting better but god damn itâ€™s difficult. One day is okay, then next I behave as if Iâ€™m some dumb rock who is incapable of being human, Iâ€™m just sat there waiting for someone else like an object, then it takes ages for me to regain a sense of autonomy and re-associate with the world. I physically feel how stressed my brain is, itâ€™s got fried wires all over. 

Iâ€™ve got so many things I need to do, but Iâ€™m on 0. I just canâ€™t bring myself to it. Things have got better, but theyâ€™ve also gotten worse. If I do the thing I need to do, itâ€™ll get me in a better place. But itâ€™s a like a catch 22. 

I canâ€™t think, feel or mentally function well. Iâ€™m alive but I feel mentally trapped. Iâ€™m locked in a box and I donâ€™t even realise I have the key."

CPTSD,"The Body Keeps the Score, Bessel van der Kolk. Book Review.","A week or so ago, I posted a book review on here for Gabor Mate's 'When The Body Says No'. A few people suggested I post further reviews for relevant texts so here's my take on Bessel Van Der Kolks' 'The Body Keeps the Score'.

&#x200B;

**What is the book about?**  
  
In this excellent volume, BVDK gives an overview of the knowledge about the effects of psychological trauma, abuse, and neglect based on three emerging disciplines:

  
â€¢	Neuroscience: the study of how the brain supports mental processes.  
â€¢	Developmental psychopathology: the study of the impact of adverse experiences on the development of mind and brain.   
â€¢	Interpersonal neurobiology: the study of how our behaviour influences the emotions, biology, and mind-sets of those around us.  
  


**What are the booksâ€™ key messages?**

Trauma is not just the event(s) that took place sometime in the past. It is also the imprint left on mind, brain, and body. This imprint has on-going consequences for how the human organism manages to survive in the present. Trauma results in a fundamental reorganisation of the way mind and brain manage perceptions. It changes not only how we think and what we think about, but also our very capacity to think. What has happened â€“ the events themselves â€“ cannot be undone. This leaves us with a series of challenges:

  
â€¢	Finding a way to become calm and focused.   
â€¢	Learning to maintain that calm in response to images, thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations that remind you of the past.  
â€¢	Finding a way to be fully alive in the present and engaged with the people around you.  
â€¢	Not having to keep secrets from yourself, including secrets about the ways that you have managed to survive.   
These goals are not steps to be achieved, one by one, in some fixed sequence. They overlap, and some may be more difficult than others, depending on individual circumstances.   
  
  
Narrowing down to developmental trauma, BVDK provides a good summary of the original 1990â€™s ACE study. In the years since TBKTSâ€™ publication in 2014 this has been widely disseminated. The section concludes with a valuable re-frame: the idea of the problem being a solution, while understandably disturbing to many, is certainly in keeping with the fact that opposing forces routinely coexist in biological systemsâ€¦ What one sees, the presenting problem, is often only the marker for the real problem, which lies buried in time, concealed by patient shame, secrecy and sometimes amnesia â€“ and, frequently clinician discomfort.  
  


Following a refreshing discussion of the DSMâ€™s weaknesses is a summary of BVDKsâ€™ as-yet unsuccessful, attempts to establish developmental trauma as its own recognised diagnosis. Readers are led to recognise that two hurdles need to conquered: (1) PTSD, C-PTSD, and developmental trauma each need to be recognised as their own diagnoses and (2) the blinkered brain disease model summarised below needs to be replaced with multi-modal helping approaches blending BVDKsâ€™ three avenues (as below) to best suit the individualsâ€™ needs.  
  


The brainâ€™s own natural neuroplasticity can be developed to help survivors feel fully alive in the present and move on with their lives. There are fundamentally three avenues to follow:

  
â€¢	Top down, by talking, (re-)connecting with others, and allowing ourselves to know and understand what is going on with us, while processing the memories of the trauma.   
â€¢	By taking medicines that shut down inappropriate alarm reactions, or by utilizing other technologies that change the way the brain organises information.   
â€¢	Bottom up: by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that result from trauma.   
  


What BVDK referred to as the the brain-disease model ignores four fundamental truths â€“ we ignore them at our peril:

  
â€¢	Our evolutionary legacy provides us with a set of capabilities â€“ and constraints. The more we â€“ or others - push those boundaries, the more likely we are to suffer. This is central to restoring and sustaining our well-being.  
â€¢	Our intelligence gives us the potential to develop ourselves, others, our environments, and our responses.  
â€¢	We have the capability to regulate aspects of our own physiology, including some of the so-called involuntary functions of the body and brain, through such basic activities as breathing, moving, and touching.  
â€¢	 We can, collectively, change social conditions to create environments aligned with our evolutionary needs and expectations within which we can feel safe and where we can thrive.

   
When we ignore these basic truths of our humanity, we deprive ourselves of ways to both prevent maladies in the first place and to heal when they do occur. We may subordinate our agency and render ourselves patients of the healthcare system, rather than exercise our agency to drive our healing process. Connecting with â€“ rather than disconnecting from â€“ what makes us incredible.   


Seeing issues with our mental health as internal processes, grants us much-needed agency â€“ that feeling of being in control of our lives: being able to make the decisions that will lead us to our chosen future. If we consider the causes of mental health issues as external factors, something that happens to or around us â€“ or as a biochemical anomaly - then it becomes a piece of history we can never dislodge. If, on the other hand, mental health issues are what take place inside us, resultant of what happened, then healing becomes a credible possibility. Trying to keep mental health issues at bay â€“ or subcontracting them out to the medics (the doctor is responsible for resolving that issue while I get on with my life) hobbles our capacity to know ourselves better â€“ to develop our agency.  
  
  
**What are its weak-spots?**

  
Due to its very nature, the content runs the risk of triggering some readers: itâ€™s difficult to see an easy solution to this.

  
TBKTS delivers on its intentions to disseminate knowledge about the effects of psychological trauma, abuse, and neglect based on the three emerging disciplines of neuroscience, developmental psychopathology, and interpersonal neurobiology. It was not intended as a self-help â€˜how to heal yourselfâ€™ which may leave some readers looking for more.   
  
While not a weakness, TBKTS was published around ten years ago. Given the pace of research, I wonder if there is scope or plans for a revised edition.   
  


**How does this relate to my own area Solution Focused Hypnotherapy?** 

  
BVDK refers to one of the key underpinning theories of SFH â€“ the triune (three phase) theory of human brain evolution. With that theory understood, we introduce two further key concepts: (1) the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between evolutionary phases and (2) developing the capability to manage that dynamic equilibrium to our advantage. Academically, these two concepts are supported by the generally accepted Broaden & Build theory (Frederickson.)

  
Trauma â€“ among other things - can shift the dynamic equilibrium to limit our options and plunge us in to vicious cycles of anger, and or anxiety and or depression (which can manifest in a myriad of ways.) Additionally, developmental trauma can lead to neurobiological effects in the hippocampus, amygdala, and pre-frontal cortex.

  
Without downplaying the seriousness of this, there are counter-balancing positive factors. To varying degrees, we each have four capabilities: Self-Awareness (interoception), Imagination, Conscience and Free-will, as articulated by Viktor Frankl. These sit at the root of us developing our sense of agency. The same process of neuroplasticity that shaped our developing neurology as children can support us in developing our adulthoods. Through the work of BVDK and many others, we have an emerging understanding of the lifelong effects of developmental trauma, and an ever-growing understanding of how these can be mitigated.

  
Solution Focused Hypnotherapy can be highly effective in helping those at threshold (motivated, and responsible for their outcomes) with anger, anxiety, and depression. Adding the body of knowledge supporting the PERMA model creates a solid platform for developing and sustaining wellbeing for those in the acceptance and action areas of the awareness / acceptance / action spectrum. Those in the earlier â€“ awareness, acceptance â€“ areas would benefit more from the traditional analytical / counselling approaches to helping.  
    


**Who would benefit from reading this book?**  


With the caveat that some readers may find elements of the content triggering, this is an ideal read for those who have ever wondered if events of their childhood are negatively affecting their present. 

  
For those experiencing developmental trauma, and those living with and supporting those who are â€“ this is one of the must reads.

CPTSD,Oddly specific: Can anyone regularly feel a strong tingle/shiver travel up their back and spread throughout the body? Is that my nervous system freaking out? Some trigger response? Something else?,Harmless compared to all my other (potential) symptoms but I felt this vividly just now and wanted to ask. Happens daily and sometimes it makes my shoulder and upper back involuntarily shake and squeeze. 
CPTSD,starting new therapies,"i've been admitted to a mental health unit and i'm about to start some trauma based therapies for the first time. i think i'm doing EMDR, psychotherapy and trauma informed DBT. anyone have any experience of going through any of these therapies? any tips or advice?"
CPTSD,I just donâ€™t know what I need,"People tell me that Iâ€™m doing well. Considering my trauma Iâ€™m doing okay but I am such a fuck up. Iâ€™ve been trying to not get my depression to the best of me but it feels so hard. 

Iâ€™m not suicidal at least Iâ€™m trying not to be but I feel so close to giving up. Iâ€™ve tried to exercise, work , I couldnâ€™t handle my full time job , Iâ€™m back at a pub. Iâ€™m drinking again to get through things. 

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the outcome of NYE that Iâ€™ve just entirely felt so overwhelmed. I keep wondering when does it get better , how much is in my control? Has my trauma entirely destroyed me ? 
Will I ever be better ?

I canâ€™t see a bright side at the end of the tunnel. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can feel like this, and itâ€™s not like I feel sorry for myself? I just donâ€™t know, I need a space to rant. I donâ€™t really tell my friends any of this because I donâ€™t want them to tire of me"
CPTSD,Somehow managed to ruin my own birthday,"My girlfriend had massage planned for me in a few days. Nothing has been reserved or paid for yet. I wanted to change it to next week, and now I see that my girlfriend is mad at me for changing plans, she's  autistic and it bothers her changing plans. I knew that but I asked anyways. I don't see how I can continue to be a fuck up on my birthday I see a shotgun barrel in my future."
CPTSD,Why does my mom always compare her self to me appearance wise?,Like when we went grad dress shopping I was trying on two dresses at aritzia one in xs and one in xxs my mom didnâ€™t want me to try on the xxs bc she thought it wouldnâ€™t fit. I said it would. I tried the xs it was too loose then I tried the xxs and it fit perfectly. She was shocked. For some reason she thinks where the same size in everything. Like dresses and even bra sizes. I got measured at Victoriaâ€™s Secret and turns out I was wearing the wrong bra size 32B I turned out to be a 32D fit great. So I bought it. My mom who was doing laundry said to me that I shouldnâ€™t being bra sizes that big bc my chest wasnâ€™t that big. I told I fit measured and that the size it came out with. She got all defensive and said but â€˜Iâ€™m a 32 aâ€™ like okay you are but my bodies not the same as yours. Soâ€¦ we had a stupid argument my mom didnâ€™t even believe me. And she kept staring at my boobs it made me really uncomfortable. Like what? Another time my brother brought up weight and my mom was telling her weight and whatever so I said mine and she didnâ€™t believe me because I was 10-15 lighter and I was also taller than her by 1 inch.  Another time my brother brought up the topic of metabolism and I said I had a fast metabolism. And my mom said that it was because I ate very little not because I had a fast metabolism. She also always comments on how I eat â€˜eat like a birdâ€™. I always wear baggy clothes around her bc I hate her saying stuff like that. It makes no sense. Iâ€™m not gonna be the same size as you. We are different people. Itâ€™s just so weird. Has anyone else experienced this?
CPTSD,Was This Normal?,"I was just wondering if this was normal? I lived with my dad from the age of 14-23. I just recently moved out 3 months ago and I have been thinking about when I was younger. I had always been very thin until the age of 19. When I started gaining weight he would slap my ass and say that ""my ass is coming in"". It made me extremely uncomfortable until one day I told him to stop and that I didn't feel comfortable with him doing that. He said he wouldn't do it anymore but didn't apologize. He didn't do it again until I came back to his house after I moved out. I don't know why he did it. It makes my skin crawl. I remember telling my friends when I was younger that he would slap my ass but I don't remember what age. It was probably even before this. Is this normal?"
CPTSD,Dissociation because of small tasks,"All things in my life considering, I'm doing pretty well in life. I'm holding down a job, I've curated a reputation as hard working and reliable, I'm getting along with my family, and I feel emotionally stronger than ever. But I'm trying to create a lifestyle for myself that is draining me to the point of dissociation. 

When I get home, I need to make dinner, and breakfast and lunch for the next day. I need to take my makeup off, work out, shower, pray, take my medicine, and maybe read a book. All normal routine things. But just the thought of doing these things, especially when I'm tired and already in my bed, is so exhausting that I've done none of these things, and it's 1AM. I have to be awake by 7, and I've been lying here just thinking about all the things I need to do.

Can anyone offer any advice for this? It's become a daily thing and I fear it may be a sign of something worse"
CPTSD,I am afraid to get a job,"I keep finding excuses. I just don't feel I am qualified to do anything. I am terrified to go to any job interview because my cv is almost empty and It's a one huge gap of me being in freeze state always. I am afraid of my reactions. I am afraid to be triggered. To be humiliated. I am too old to not have a job. I keep telling myself I need to learn all this/that perfectly first and then I will try. I know everyone will judge me and keep judging me. The funniest thing is that I really want to be responsible, functioning adult and not a scary, lazy, bum with nothing to do. I don't want to be such a loser. Saying that I am ashamed of it is understatemnt. Shame ate me long time ago, I am walking shame."
CPTSD,How to deal with emotional overwhelm when coming out of chronic freeze?,"Quite recently, Iâ€™ve been able to consistently come out of freeze for a few brief moments. Iâ€™m immediately bombarded with a decadeâ€™s worth of repressed anger, anxiety, fear, and just sheer hatred to the point where I consciously HAVE to make myself dissociate again because of how overwhelming these emotions are. 

Any advice on how to deal with or desensitize myself to these emotions, despite being largely unable to feel them? Thanks :)"
CPTSD,You are a diamond in disguise!,"I would state several trigger warnings to begin with; CSA, SA, intimate partner abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and suicide ideation ; these are all flags that have applied to me at some part in my life's chronology. But this is not a post in which I want to relay the details of what caused me to qualify for a CPTSD diagnosis. Rather, I want to share how I got on top of it. 

In 2017 I had a mental breakdown after I left my ex-partner, who was the cause of so much suffering. I always thought of myself as ordinary like a rock. I felt like this breakdown split me apart and open; what I saw in that darkness was something that glittered. I began to view myself as only encapsulated by a layer of rock, but a rough diamond inside. I played small to survive; not because I am. My mission from henceworth was to keep chipping at layers of density, keep chiseling and carving this diamond, until I shine. Radical self-acceptance was my goal.

After having been born into homelessness and deep poverty, I have been able to work myself up. Often out of sheer rebellion against ideas that ""the apple does not fall far from the tree"", or ""a penny can never be a dollar"" (a saying in my homecountry). I sacrificed so much of my freetime and happiness to be able to start my working life with a strong CV. While my teachers as a teenager thought I would do some shitty job, I most definitely got more accolades than them now.

My CPTSD has often been a roadblock on the way. I've been heavily dissociative and self-sabotaging in making poor decisions and feeling too distraught, but I also managed to navigate those setbacks in such a way that I could draw my silver-linings from it and turn a bad situation into a positive situation. I realized at some point for example that my workaholicism was only a self-esteem-by-proxy; without good grades and compliments from my boss I felt like nothing. When I hit burnout in 2017, as I had to quit studying and working to focus on my mental health, I realized how ludicrous this idea is. I am good enough; I don't need to proof myself to be just that. I learned to love myself having nothing to show for it. My house was a depression hole and I was too ashamed to even be seen in a supermarket. This was the moment I decided that the only opinion that matters about me is my own. I noticed so many of my progammed beliefs and thoughts were in essence internalizing the gaslighting and negativity of others, they were not my own voice! I started to talk courage and compassion into myself, to embrace myself at my lowest point ever.  Since then, I have been able to become my own best friend. I can see through the bullshit of negative beliefs very quickly now, to the point I laugh as soon as I think it.

I've seen 7 therapists, sometimes just a short-term treatment of 3 consultations, other times 1,5 year of extensive treatment. I have done ""talk therapy"", CBT, schematherapy and a whopping 24 sessions of EMDR. 

In early 2022 I found the crucial tipping point; after my last sequence of EMDR treatments, and finding the right medication of a mild mirtazapine dosis, I managed to control my own dysregulation and have since not suffered anymore from the destabilizing effects of CPTSD. 

I also landed a great job by the end of 2022, and I negotiated an almost double income. These are boons from overcoming CPTSD; I have more confidence in valueing myself highly, and my trauma-fueled hypervigilance has turned into a good skill at reading and talking to people, while differentiating between myself and others emotionally. I am now able to make a clean slate financially and invest in becoming financially independent and retiring early.

Along the way, I have made many good and safe friendships with people who reflect my values; emotionally intelligent, hardworking, inclusive, kind, curious, generous, adventurous, humerous and successful people. They played an enormous role that I am forever thankful for in evaporizing my shame-complex. Picking the right people to associate yourself with has been a battle, but I have cut every person who brought me down, and I am not that socially shy to make new friends. Making friends is a skill you can refine.

I have remolded the relationship with my family, and restored the respect and closeness with my father and mother. We have tackled difficult conversations and I thank them for their courage to partake in that journey with me.

I am 33 now and I feel like I can start the next book of my life. I no longer have anything that holds me back or requires focused attendance to repair. All I can do is thank the strength, resilience and belief of my former self that better times can be forged with dedication and patience. 

I understand that the work is never truly done, life will always throw a curveball, but I got the tools to deal with it. I don't care about going to the 8th therapist if I find it necessary. The shame about seeing a therapist is completely gone. I inform all my doctors ahead of time I have CPTSD, so that they can get to know me when I am regulated and stable, so in the event I slip back for whatever reason, it won't be a huge stumbleblock to ask for help and it won't need much explanation.

I don't think my healing journey is extraordinary. I think if I can do it, so can others. Reject all the deflating and demotivating messages of the world how ""you're stuck"" and ""this cannot ever be made right"" and keep forging that path. Even victim support organizations have told me ""with your trauma it will take you a decade to feel right"", and by despising and rejecting such ideas I made it through. I chose to believe in myself, my resilience and my ability to carve a life for myself from surviving to thriving, no matter the opinion, even of ""experts"". You are a diamond in disguise! That is your secret. Let nobody tell you otherwise."
CPTSD,Repressed memory â€œsnapping backâ€ into my mind,"I donâ€™t know how else to explain this other than last night I woke up and was lying awake trying to go back to sleep. Iâ€™m 30F, married to a loving husband and some things Iâ€™ve kept to myself for a very long time due to chronic shame and blame. 

I remember being a child and touching other children inappropriately- I was around 5-8 years old. I also have very few memories from around this time. Last night for some reason I was thinking about things I physically feel repulsed by when my husband does them to me sexually. Nothing degrading, very normal stuff. But one thing in particular I remember thinking â€œwow I really hate that for some reasonâ€¦â€ then suddenly, immediately an image in my head of me doing that thing with another child popped into my head. It was like all at once it made sense that I donâ€™t like it because for one, I equate it with shame (Iâ€™m so ashamed I did this to other children) and disgust. Iâ€™m very concerned my dad did this to me.

When Iâ€™m around my dad today, I recoil if he tries to touch me. I have small children and my gut reaction to him touching my children was â€œstop.â€ I didnâ€™t say it but I felt it. I have no memories of him doing anything to me but my body is like â€œno!â€

To clarify more, last weekend I found a file folder in my moms storage unit of profiles of my dad discussing prostitutes with other men, discussing how he and his brother enjoyed doing graphic sexual things with prostitutes together. It was like I was meant to see that to help piece some things together.

I had counseling today and my therapist said itâ€™s likely Iâ€™m starting to remember real things now that Iâ€™m starting to heal. She said almost all of her clients describe recovering repressed memories in the same way - like pieces of a puzzle snapping together and having a sense of understanding about it.

I donâ€™t WANT this to be true. Guess Iâ€™m just looking for someone to describe their experience remembering repressed memories so I can know if what Iâ€™m experiencing was real.

Also, my parents are divorced. I was no contact for one year with him due to feeling betrayed by him having affairs. I didnâ€™t know he was soliciting prostitutes. He lives states away so we only see him once a year if that. Heâ€™s clearly a narcissist and has always been abusive. I didnâ€™t remember these specific things"
CPTSD,Goodbye sub.,"A certain someone found my reddit and I'm very not okay with that. I'm trying to move forward with my life. So today, I took a huge step to keep my own peace and I hope thats respected and understood. (You know who you are) Please just leave me and my life alone. Thats all i want.

Until I feel comfortable coming back with a new alias and all this shit blows over..
I have to say my goodbyes and my thanks to you all in this sub. Knowing that this sub was here helped me grow a lot as a person, kept me going on some of my worst days and I'm going to miss that support.

Right now, I need to get off the radar and hope to whatever is out there just, leaves me alone.
Thanks guys. Until another time, maybe.âœŒï¸"
CPTSD,Does anybody sometimes feel like youâ€™re completely healed?,"This is so weird. I cut contact with my friends and family for 5 years now. I only discovered I had CPTSD in the past 2/3 years and I feel like Iâ€™ve made a lot of progress even though I have not been to a therapist.. the emotional flashbacks are really much more sparse now though I just had one on New Yearâ€™s Eve.. 

I do this thing where once a year or a few months i get curious enough and I go on Facebook and look everyone up. It used to be I wasnâ€™t able to see any updates of my family without a huge emotional flashback and being non-functional for days. But then Iâ€™ll repeat it maybe a year later and the intensity of the flashback gradually lessens.. I went on again today, started looking at pics of my niece, and my brother posted a pic of them with his wife, our dad and our grandma. My dad was basically the source of all my trauma, and idk if my brother made up with him or my dad had a come to Jesus moment or whatever. But when I saw the picture I was not triggered? I have not seen him for 5 years.. Like I canâ€™t see myself speaking to my parents still but I feel I can make contact with my brother. Am I cured now or smth.. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m not getting an emotional flashback..

Is it possible any of you have gotten rid of them for good? I feel oddly at peace and idk whatâ€™s going on..

My only problem now is thinking of reconnecting with my friends but not being able to tell them why I isolated because I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d believe I struggled with CPTSD because I look so fine.."
CPTSD,This is the end for me ig :(,"I guess after my Dad dies I'll commit suicide? He's like really old and if he dies I won't have any financial support since I can't work. I can't even take care of myself either, as I'm typing this I'm literally covered in filth and dried period blood. And if I won't be able to constantly daydream and live in peace in isolation I'd rather just die. I tried asking my sister for advice about SSI and I tried my best to imply that my Dad abuses me and I told her how horrible my mental health was but uh...she didn't help and just spouted religious nonsense at me :/ Actually even when I told her directly about my Dad abusing me a few years ago she didn't do anything about it then. Is this really the end? I mean it's really comforting that I get to die but it still feels scary.  
It's kinda funny how I've always fantasized about moving out when I turned 18 but I'm 18 now and I'm still here. Like, this is a ""so that was a fucking lie"" moment. And when I got sent to that horrid TTI facility for truancy I thought that I would finally be able to leave my Dad for good. When the caseworker and therapist there said that I would get sent back if I didn't give them a reason for why I didn't want to go back, I actually told them that my Dad abuses me. I actually did it. That was such a HUGE thing for me. And you know what they did? They told my probation officer that I wanted to go back and that they saw no problem sending me back. And even after that when I called my probation officer and told him that I couldn't be here and that I couldn't function he told me to just get emancipated. It's so silly no? No matter what I do it'll always be the same result.  
This is all honestly such a pain and I don't know what to do I just wanna die forever DX

CPTSD,People pleasing and impulse control,"What I have realized is that I overspend money on other people. Best example nye-party. I am tight with money but yet lack control of spending money on drinks or Ubers for other people. I am more successful in not giving in when I am alone and want to spend money on things I donâ€™t need. 

I had a budget on how much I want to spend. Somehow other people were more tight with money, asked me to order and pay the Uber and I ended up paying alone because I didnâ€™t want to upset anyone. This is just one example. 

Does this relate to some of you?  Do you have an idea how to handle these situations better?"
CPTSD,I feel scammed honestly,"I did everything I was supposed to do. I spent my teen years having 3 appointments a week, going to a day center, now I'm an adult and I'm still going to my appointments, I stopped self harming, I'm taking my meds, I'm in college, I'm about to go to uni, I have a job and I'm about to get another, better job.

And yet I'm still struggling, I'm still anxious as fuck, I still feel like shit, and honestly the amount of stress that getting this new job and applying to uni is putting on me makes me want to die. 

I didn't fucking ""recover"", i just got functional enough to stop being a problem. I've gone out of my way to make things better and I'm still fucking struggling I'm sick of this. I can't even ask for help anymore without it jeaprodizing my future (want to go into healthcare, need to be stable). I don't know what I'm going to do. I just want to be happy."
CPTSD,Petrified,"I'm petrified. I met a very nice girl on New Year's Eve, and now I wanted to write to her... but I can't, I have an acute sense of terror in my stomach every time I think about writing something to her and how it might go later, both if it's negative but still more if it will go well. I realize that I feel like I'm in a cage, just one step away from freedom, but I can't take that step, I realize that I can't conceive of being happy, of deserving happiness. It has always been like this, I don't think I can do it"
CPTSD,Experiencing zoochosis. Don't know what to do.,"TW for ideation

I was able to go out to see and talk to human beings less times than I can count on one hand last year. If it wasn't for groceries or necessities. A few days before the year ended I went to a nightclub by myself. I didnt even drink, i just wanted to dance and sing, bond with other people over shared music taste. But of course it was a big deal in my family. I went out the house and the cameras caught me going outside, and as I walked to the train station to buy my train ticket, the woman that gave birth to me pulled up in her car. Yelling at me and telling me I can't go by myself, forcing her way into my trip.

I was exhausted by the time I got home, because she refused to be ready on time, by the time I needed to leave. Because of her, we ended up missing the train and experienced about 2 hours in delays due to it. We had to wait out in the freezing cold because the train we missed was the last train before a technical issue happened that caused delays, that maneuver would throw off the train schedule for the rest of the night.

I turn 24 this year, and this is my last push to escape before I give up and probably kill myself. My last compromise is that I'll be out here by November.

I live in failure. I tried to move out in 2020, and was denied because I couldn't do direct withdrawal from my job (I was unemployed and planning to get a job AFTER moving). That sent me into a deep freeze of depression, that I haven't been able to crawl out since. I tried getting a job recently but I only lasted one day before needing to quit. The jobs demands of me were not sustainable, and I would likely end up injured and sick if I continued. I'm autistic and unable to hold down any job.. I'm also unable to drive currently.

So no means of making money to escape.

I used to work in restaurant industry. They treated us inhumanely but pay was just above state minimum. My physical health declined quickly at the job. Fail.

I did delivery for one day, I didn't last since the job was fucked up with their ""on-call"" surprise calls. Fail.

I've been trying to make and sell cosmetics and handmade jewelry. A local store took about a dozen of my items, and didn't want to take anymore. Setting up selling platforms is overwhelming, I don't even know if it will be worth it, but im trying. It's not even gonna make me much but pocket change, after fees and shipping... it's not a mortgage. It's not food money. Even if I succeed, I'll lose all my time to creating product, listing, marketing, and shipping product. All for it to not pay enough. Fail.

I'm trying to learn web design so maybe I can have a ""real job"", but by hearing how difficult it is to actually land a job, I don't have much faith. There's no guarantee I can learn all of this and not have my efforts wasted. Like all of my efforts have been wasted everywhere else in my life. If it was that easy, wouldn't everyone else have done it?

I feel like nothing is worth it at this point, to even be realistically doing decent in life. Four fucking years down the drain. Even further back that I failed all those times I tried to run away as a kid. And staying with my parents so long. I think I deserve it at this point. I wished I wasn't forced into dependence so I could escape at 18 like many traumatized people do. No, I lost 6 more years of my life. I realized I had to escape at 14 but I was legally unable to do anything.

My therapist can't see me today so I have to wait for my next appointment. So here I vent and seek support if anybody is willing. Happy new years everyone, I hope we all have a better year."
CPTSD,false or recovered memory?,"i (18 f) was diagnosed with cptsd (and bpd but im fighting to have that diagnosis removed) a little over a year ago now. i suffer frequent emotional and visual flashbacks from being emotionally abused a couple years ago by my dad and his partner. i have also been emotionally abused by my mother but that was like 5 years ago now so i canâ€™t remember a lot of it and flashbacks are few and far between. when i was younger my dad was an abusive alcoholic, but he never hit me or my family- or so i thought. my earliest memory as a child is him coming home drunk and smashing up the tv in my living room, so he often had these outbursts of uncontrolled, violent rage. a few weeks ago i was watching a movie that had a scene where someone was hitting their child, and i suddenly saw in my head being held down and hit on my backside by my dad. i was in my old house and i mustâ€™ve been 4 or 5 years old. i keep seeing it in my head now quite often like other flashbacks and i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s real or not. i donâ€™t even know if the movie is what triggered it. the memory seems and feels really real, and whenever i think about it it feels like i am a sobbing and screaming little girl in my chest. all my therapists are off work and i just wanted to see if anyone has had any similar experiences recovering traumatic memories so long after they happened, or if itâ€™s likely not a real memory."
CPTSD,Freaking out about a routine medical appointment gone wrong (TW medical trauma),"I just walked several miles to get home after fleeing from a gyne appointment for a fairly common medical procedure. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m freaking out over nothing but I couldnâ€™t stay there.

(Warning-some discussion of gynecology below, I will try to not be totally graphic)

This was my first time at this particular doctor. She was highly recommended by my neighbors and has good Google and Zocdoc reviews. But while I was waiting for her in the exam room, she initiated a speakerphone call from the hallway right outside the door. She called a diagnostic lab to get test results for a patient who was already there in the office for a follow up appointment. She identified the patient by full name and ageâ€”this was the first major problem. The person on the other end of the phone gave her the details of the test resultsâ€”second major problem and proof (to me at least) that this doctor has terrible judgment to place such a call in a non-private area on fucking speakerphone.

The worst part about all of this is that the patient has cancer. Itâ€™s a relatively rare form of cancer, especially for someone as young as this patient is (the doctor gave her age). And some random stranger knew about it before she did, unless she was the patient in the exam room next to me. I could hear someone coughing in that room. I hope to god it wasnâ€™t her because if it was then she just found out that she has a devastating disease in a brutal way.

If I had been thinking clearly I would have opened the door of my exam room and poked my head out into the hallway so that the doctor might realize that people in the exam rooms could hear her. But I massively freaked out and could barely get my clothes back on to get out of there. 

Now that Iâ€™m home I keep telling myself that Iâ€™m okay, Iâ€™m safe, and even if I overreacted by fleeing my appointment it was the right thing to do for me. There were other, more minor things that happened before the phone call that made me uncomfortable at that office. But I canâ€™t stop thinking about the woman with cancer. I hope sheâ€™s got all the support she will need."
CPTSD,Still shaken. Can you offer emotional support?,"It is January, 2nd. My cell rings.

I pick up and say â€œYes?â€

On the other end: â€œHello here is X, who am I talking to?â€

I hang up immediately, the sickly sweet voice of my evil brother still ringing in my ears. The number goes into my block list the next minute.

It has been six years since I went no contact with my entire family for good reason. During those years my mother tried to triangulate once and I received two obituary notices of extended family in the mail (at my published address).

Who gave him this number? It is not listed anywhere. Only one person who works in an industry built on confidentiality â€“ and also counts my family as customers â€“ has it. A few others who have no official relation to my family have it.

There have been a handful of incidences, where it was not unthinkable that they bribed people. There have been inexplicable, large stumbling blocks. Those are impossible to prove, but todayâ€˜s call renders the suspicions more real.

I have been going to great lengths so they canâ€˜t figure out my physical address or anything they can use against me. Will have to step up my game once more.

My heart is still pounding. Can you offer emotional support?

ETA 9 hours later:

I bow to you all. Your stories, your compassion, validation, and advice are beyond precious. Am still meditating and the fear is slowly dissolving. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart."
CPTSD,Losing faith,"Ever since the holiday season and seeing my family, I have been slipping. I really feel like if I could just hire someone to totally clean and organize my house I would be able to maintain it, but every time I come home, I slip into a depression and everything just gets worse. I canâ€™t cook (dirty dishes dirty fridge, feels pointless to go to the grocery store) so I end up spending so much $$ on takeout. My bed is full of crumbs. I recently got a kitten and love her and clean up as much as possible but there is also some litter around and that feels unsanitary, and it makes me feel gross. Every time Iâ€™m home I get terrible tension headaches. All I want to do is get high and lay in my gross bed. I did my laundry but my apartment is so small with no closets so a lot of my clothes just stay out, usually out on my desk or chairs. So then I canâ€™t use my desk or chairs when doing online work - so I work in bed. This is terrible for my mental health. I am so privileged to have a well off family and Iâ€™ve always thought at least if things got really bad, they would help. But I donâ€™t want to admit they are that bad. Iâ€™ve distanced myself from my family and it would feel so shitty to ask them for $$ now. I am looking for a new apartment and would have to ask my dad to co-sign because all my income is freelance or gig work. My partner is older and the other day he mentioned his credit card bill was $60k from the holidays and I asked him if he paid that all off at once and he said yes. Iâ€™m crying just thinking about that now. I donâ€™t want his money but it makes me so fucking sad everyone is struggling and this jerk who is unfortunately very kind and had a nice upbringing and no existential crises can justâ€¦ succeed in life. Who does that?? Iâ€™m so jealous. 

Iâ€™m becoming so cynical that I will never be able to function in this society and I donâ€™t know that I want to. But I do, or I wouldnâ€™t be fighting this hard. I have goals and am in school for carpentry and have 2 other professions (in which I donâ€™t work much at, but want to) but it seems like I am always keeping my head above water and not making progress. Even getting a new apartment would mean that Iâ€™d have to repair all the shit Iâ€™ve let go in my current place. I need motivation or i am going to slip fully into being non functioning. I am considering checking myself into a hospital but it isnâ€™t â€œthatâ€ bad and I feel like that would only make things worse. The only thing keeping me from it is my partner, I was getting better and I am too embarrassed to fully collapse, but Iâ€™m so close. I donâ€™t fucking care. I hate this world but I also know that I love it too, there are so many good things despite all the pain and suffering, but I just canâ€™t feel it now, and Iâ€™m losing hope again.
Iâ€™m feeling very misunderstood because this really feels like if my environment changed, I would be fine. But I canâ€™t crawl out of a hole and make progress that counts in this world ie making money. Like I canâ€™t even get to a decent point to just maintain. I want to scream"
CPTSD,Mom says iâ€™m lying about my childhood trauma,"I had a meeting with a psychologist about the results of my assessment and my mom basically insisted on being there too (even though iâ€™m 18). Well the psychologist started talking about how I have childhood trauma and my mom almost immediately starts talking about how she was a great parent and how I was born with something wring with me. After walking out of the meeting my mom went off on me telling me I lied to my psychologist and that I was the one that gave her trauma with my bad behavior as a child. 

&#x200B;

Now I canâ€™t help but wonder if my brain is just making it all up, if maybe iâ€™m exaggerating and it wasnâ€™t as bad as I thought. My childhood feels so fuzzy the more I get older I remember less and less. Even though I know for sure my mom would be neglectful and passed out drunk a lot of the time while also having hurt me physically, I canâ€™t help but feel as if maybe  iâ€™m looking for trauma, especially since it didnâ€™t happen every day, though it feels like it did. 

&#x200B;

I went to ask my dad for confirmation as heâ€™s the only sane person in my family, but even though he agreed about the alcoholism, instability, emotional abuse, and neglect, he said he never witnessed my mom hurting me that badly even though I REMEMBER showing him scratch marks and bruises she had given me when I was little, but he says to his knowledge there were other explanations for that even though I have a faint memory of my mom beating/scratching me, granted itâ€™s only a single memory but I have a gut feeling she definitely did it more than once. 

&#x200B;

I just feel soâ€¦ empty? broken? I donâ€™t know. It feels like an important word thatâ€™s on the tip of your tongue but you can never quite remember it. I feel so stupid for blaming my mom on traumatizing me when for all I know I could be over exaggerating in order to make myself feel more validated for my problems. I just want to remember correctly."
CPTSD,Is it okay if my dreams feel more real than my life?,"So I wanna talk about the dreams because I think most of us prefer to sleep rather to live in a destroyed world. But I can't get something off, some of my dreams feel so real and the emotions that I get from the people of my dreams are like new to me. I don't know it is love? care? for those imaginary people? or it's me that I want to live in something like this?"
CPTSD,"Evangelion, Madoka Magica, and CPTSD and toxic shame. SPOILER WARNING","I very recently found out about my CPTSD and in the past 3 months dove into learning about myself and doing a lot of introspection etc. During this time while doing some projects with my partner we decided to watch madoka, while I was in the middle of learning about toxic shame and why I do these things to myself etc. I had seen this series before but my partner had not. But being in the middle of reading books about trauma... watching the series had a new light for me. Its the books animated. Its toxic shame and cptsd and fawning and flight mode. 

 I finished Evangelion for the first time yesterday. I had heard that fans really hated the ending but I had no idea what would happen besides clapping. The last two episodes are literally me in shame. Its me reading these books learning about CPTSD. Its all of that.  At the very end he finally finds value in himself. I didn't dislike the ending, it felt so timely... but I also do think it does end too fast. He figures out he can just be valuable its not something he has to do. It doesn't make sense he figured it out yet for me though. I cant figure that out. I don't know how to just be valuable without getting my worth from my work or how useful I am etc.

 I don't know what I want to try to say with this besides wanting to talk to others and if they saw what I saw. Have yall watched media in the past even like cartoons for kids after learning about cptsd and saw things in a new light? I think if i ever feel healed I will play the clapping scene. I have seen it linked as like a joking meme, something stupid but I think that might have been an insulting context. What he figured out is big and important and hard... its worth celebrating.  


Btw I haven't watched any of the movies for these things I have no clue if that changes things. "
CPTSD,I'm trying to work out what exactly it is that brings people with low self esteem together.,"I want to do a second by second, sports style analysis of what's going on in interactions that has meant that I have gotten on with people who also have low self esteem. Now whilst doing healing work and taking a look at who it is that I'm friends with and who I click with when meeting new people I can't quite put my finger on it.

I just had a thought that perhaps it's been boundaries ðŸ¤” like when a person with healthy self esteem would set boundaries that was foreign to me so it would feel like rejection so I would gravitate away from that.

I've also thought for a long time that humour was part of it, like I found those with fucked up homes had the same kind of humour as me.

Interested to hear others thoughts."
CPTSD,Is anyone else triggered by other people's success?,"When I see someone being good at what they do, especially if it's also something I have considered pursuing, I instantly feel unsafe. It's not even that I'm jealous or feel like I'm not good enough, I literally have to be better or I'm in danger. It's so messed up, and I hate not being able to be happy for others.

I think it's because my mother compared the hell out of me when I was a kid - as soon as I got good at X, there was always ""oh but so-and-so can do Y better than you"". There was literally no way to win with her. 

Does anyone else struggle with this? Were you able to address it in therapy? If so, what helped? Thank you for reading."

diagnosedPTSD,Disassociation,"Hello to all my fellow PTSD warriors. 

We are all amazing. 

I was abandoned as a baby so I had PTSD all my life, didn't help that the reasons kept pilling on. 

I have disassociated since I can remember, I didn't know what that was until the past few years. 

When I was in high school I thought I was hearing voices, but now I know I was just coming in and out of it. 

Ever since I started to really learn about PTSD I realize that so many things that my body did was disassociation.

There was a pipe bomb at my neighbor's house across the street from me, being that I am a veteran that lives in Israel I guess it was too much and I got a seizure. Second one this year. 

I used to function and disassociate and  that would get me in a lot of trouble and risked my life more times than I remember. (pudum pum! Love a good pun.)

The more I learn about myself and my symptoms the more freedom I feel. I used to drink a ton of caffeine and do a lot of stimulating drugs because I kept ""falling asleep.""

I don't drink or do drugs anymore I am sober. I smoke medical marijuana and for me personally, it saved my life. 

Sometimes, a lot of times, I'll judge myself for ""wasting time staring"". Even with what I know now, sometimes I still get intolerant and judgmental towards myself. 

I was disassociating earlier today and thought to myself: It's almost like my brain gets possessed. 

I always remind myself: There is life with PTSD

I even enjoy my life something I never thought I would say.

diagnosedPTSD,"Vyvance, Adderall",Do anyone gets a prescription of vyvanse or Adderall for ptsd without adhd? I saw some articles about it. I will ask to my doctor but I am curious.
diagnosedPTSD,Is this medication helpful?,"Hello, 

So, literally yesterday I was finally ( after 6 years ) diagnosed with Complex PTSD - Apparently my brain has been developing this over the years since I was about 12.
I feel quite happy that I know what this is , I thought for a long while I had schizophrenia because I often see and hear things that arenâ€™t there,But thatâ€™s not the case. 

Anyway, Iâ€™m going on medication at some point, and the Psychiatrist suggested I go on either Sertraline or escitalopram (?) or fluoxetine, Ive heard of sertraline and Fluoxetine, But never heard of escitalopram?.

Can anyone that takes any of these medications let me know what theyâ€™re like? The symptoms? Do they stop your brain with the horrible intrusive thoughts?.

Thank you!"

diagnosedPTSD,I feel like my CPTSD is not valid,"A few months ago I've been diagnosed with CPTSD, it was a devastating point for me cause it hit me I've been suffering for years from that (looking back I've had those symptoms and been in this state for hear now). Even though I'm being supported by my friends and family, I can't help but feel like I'm not valid. 
The main reasons for that are that my flashbacks look different, they're not in form or images like they describe it. They're just intense feelings that take me back to that time, such as fear, anxiety and shame. My flashbacks don't cause me to panic, I either can't breathe or feel like im about to throw up or I dissociate through them. Other than that, I'm relatively calm. I'm easily triggered but half the time I can't even describe what had triggered me, it happens so randomly and sometimes it looks like it happened for no reason. 
It's really hard for me to deal with it, I can barely function and that overwhelming guilt that I'm faking is not helping. I know it's kinda stupid, but I really need some advice on that or at least someone to talk to about it."
diagnosedPTSD,Diagnosed but very little info given and no treatment,"I was diagnosed with PTSD and canâ€™t be treated at the moment.  I have stress, anxiety and depression alongside it.

It was really bad for a few years, I couldnâ€™t sleep, function, remember anything, didnâ€™t understand what was happening, and lots of nightmares and fear. Iâ€™ve managed to get some control by not doing things that trigger me. I wouldnâ€™t leave my home and worked online.

I get triggered by people, places etc. I realise I now just avoid going or being around people/places that trigger me.  I canâ€™t go back to how I was before, thatâ€™s really scary as I had no control over things or
me and seemed like I was crazy to others.

I go through so much mental thinking about situations etc before taking any action.  I had an job interview yesterday and in the morning all I could do was think about should I go or not. Itâ€™s in the same company I work for and my counseller said it is abusive I should stop but I need the money.  I went and now I wish I hadnâ€™t - Iâ€™m completely down again and stressed out.  

Am I making things worse for myself? I go through periods where I canâ€™t do things nothing interests me, to not being able to sleep and trying to navigate ways to get through things.  Getting everyday things done is really difficult my house is a mess and I have no motivation.  Every time I feel
motivated I get triggered and sink.  Is this how ptsd shows up.

Now the only way I can function is to not do much and only after thinking carefully about it.  If I feel any type of stress I stop and do nothing, to avoid it getting worse.  I have no routines that I can keep.

I have never really understood it.  Can anyone help me out to understand what is going on."
diagnosedPTSD,Symptoms worse after diagnosis?,"Hey everyone, 
Iâ€™m brand new here- both to Reddit and this community. I was just diagnosed with PTSD last week after having symptoms for about 6-7 years now (thank God for my fiancÃ© who finally convinced me to get checked out). These past few years have certainly been the hardest of my life and Iâ€™ve gone through both good periods and bad with my issues. Iâ€™m noticing though that Iâ€™m definitely feeling much worse since being diagnosed and was curious if anyone had the same experience? Iâ€™m thinking it might be a mix of reality just setting in that my issues are real/ not something I can avoid any longer and the reopening of some memories Iâ€™ve suppressed that came out during the intake process. Did anyone have something similar theyâ€™ve experienced at the beginning of their recovery process? Thanks in advance for anyone that can share their thoughts!"

diagnosedPTSD,Itâ€™s been a while but sometimes Iâ€™m not okay,"7 years ago I experienced something tragic and violent. I tried what I could to save someone else but was unable. Iâ€™ve done years of EMDR and have gotten used to the new normal but lately Iâ€™ve been struggling. 

As Bessel Van der Kolk says in his book, The Body Keeps Score, it really doesâ€¦keep score. My PTSD has been triggered lately and I have no idea why. Recently the unaliving ideations have been popping up and theyâ€™re so intense, the flashbacks I thought I had conquered have been making appearances as well, albeit in less triggering ways than before. The problem is that Iâ€™ve been feeling triggered so many times lately and I have no idea why. My body is feeling things that my brain is not intuned to. 

I feel like a fraud, wandering about like a normal person, pretending like things are okay, but Iâ€™m so fucked up inside and I canâ€™t tell anyone because I donâ€™t want or need for them to worry about me, not that theyâ€™d really understand anyways. I hate that the thoughts of how I would end things consume so much of my time. Even when things are okay, they seem to be lingering in the background. 

I hate feeling so fucked up and I really miss who I used to be. I hate the new fucking normal, itâ€™s sucks and is anything but normal. 

Iâ€™ve taken a minute to regroup and am not going to hurt myself but just needed to get this off my chest. I hope you all are doing okay. Big hugs â¤ï¸"
diagnosedPTSD,Approaches to destigmatizing PTSD,"In the last couple of months I've came across multiple articles proposing changing the name of the diagnosis *Posttraumatic Stress Disorder* in an attempt to reduce stigma. The focus of the name change is on the word *Disorder* whereas the suggestions either ask for *Disorder* to get dropped completely or get replaced by the word *Injury*:  
- Posttraumatic Stress (PTS)  
- Posttraumatic Stress Injury (PTSI)


&nbsp;


Stigma associated with PTSD is definitely a problem but do you think changing the name will actually make a difference?  
Do you think the terms *Posttraumatic Stress* or *Posttraumatic Stress Injury* would describe your mental struggles more accurately than the term *Posttraumatic Stress Disorder*?  
How do you feel about the term *Disorder* in general?"

diagnosedPTSD,Time to say it out loud (or in writing),"Okay, so I have never said this publicly before, but it's time. I suffer from PTSD stemming from an incident with a police officer in my home in 2017. I have been attempting to deal with the psychological ramifications since that time. Some of my coping mechanisms have not been the healthiest choices. Instead of peace, I found legal troubles and brand new ways to break. 

I have now taken on healthier methods of trying to cope, including talk therapy, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medication, and going to school to pursue a master's degree in psychology to help me better understand my own mind.

That background is painful but important to share, both as I try to finally heal AND as my PTSD has been triggered this year by another incident with police abuse of power and lies. 

Going to local law enforcement got me called a liar and opportunist; the prosecutor would sooner burn me at the stake than take me at my word. I have been branded a criminal who thinks she is above the law, regardless of what the truth might be.

I have never wanted to be the center of attention, preferring to fly under the radar and work behind the scenes, but this time, they are taking too much from me. They're taking my voice. They are making me feel so small, so unimportant, that I wonder if any of this is even worth it. They're taking my life, the one I am trying so hard to build for MYSELF, for maybe the first time ever. That's why I am writing this. If I don't speak now, I know I never will. 

The question is: should I challenge the system? Should I step out of the shadows and try to shine light on how horribly flawed law enforcement is in this very small town, with even smaller minds? Is it worth it?"
diagnosedPTSD,PTSD and relationships,"I feel as though my ptsd is ruining my relationship. 

I always hate using the fact that my illness has a role in the way I think or act because I donâ€™t want to view myself as an attachment to it. It just tends to feel reductive and as if Iâ€™m using it as a scapegoat. But I really canâ€™t ignore the impact it has in my relationships. 

My relationship was going in a direction that was good, he knew some of the stuff that I went through, what some of my triggers were, what ptsd looks like, etc. A lot of it I thought I had under control but boy was I wrong. I never really realized how getting into a healthy relationship exposed how bad I was at being in one and that I never really understood the extent of my ptsd. 

When I was in an unhealthy relationship, it was easy to have those feelings of mistrust, that this person is using me and/or really doesnâ€™t love/care for me, something is going to go wrong, and be proven right when it did. It was easy to just accept that the truth was this person was not good and that what I was feeling was valid. 

Then comes a healthy relationship in which exposed all the things I did that were not healthy. The misguided sense of mistrust when nothing arose but just waiting for it happen because it â€œalwaysâ€ does, the small action or verbal saying was looked at with a microscope to see if the story was true or not in which it mostly landed on it being not true because of these past unrelated connections, and when everything was going well, waiting for it all to go so wrong soon because nothing ever stays good. 

I can confidently say that all of this is ruining my relationship and I have no idea how to stop it from doing so. Sometimes I wonder maybe I shouldnâ€™t even bother to stop it because why would I deserve any form of love or care; I should just be alone so no one can hurt me anymore. Then I know itâ€™s the ptsd talking after going through that loop but I can never pin point it in the beginning. It just makes me realize more of how much I am a slave to it and that I overestimated my ability to regulate it despite my claim that I am â€œself awareâ€. 

Itâ€™s just so godamn hard every day and exhausting. I wish I never had to deal with it. I envy the people who can just be at peace with what had happened to them and form healthy connections with the people in their lives. I envy the calmness they have of never looking for signs of danger everywhere or analyzing everything to the finest detail. I envy the idea of just letting go and living in the moment. I envy the idea of feeling loved without the need for a why or that it comes with a condition. Lastly, I envy the idea of just being okay."
diagnosedPTSD,Newly Diagnosed,"Iâ€™m here to ask how everyone handled receiving their diagnosis at first? Itâ€™s been hitting me hard for some reason. Everyone in my life said they couldâ€™ve told me themselves I had PTSD but for some reason I never saw it as a possibility. I thought my trauma wasnâ€™t â€œhorribleâ€ enough. I just received this diagnosis about two months ago from my current therapist. Iâ€™m 21 years old. While receiving this diagnosis made me feel so much more sane for the things I do and feel, it made me deeply sad because it confirms how bad my childhood was.

My symptoms decreased quite drastically after a life event. This is not of importance here, just wanted to mention that I did not necessarily had a ""soft recovery"" but it felt more like being kicked out of PTSD into a new reality. So this might not necessarily be a typical recovery-experience?

I'm now finally in the position to start this new chapter in my life and it's the small things that bring me so much joy, although I didn't even know how much I missed them in the last couple of years. Like for example being able to enjoy the morning sun instead of waking up in panic.

There's a lot of silence and peace following recovery. That's exactly what I wanted for such a long time and now that it's finally like this, I struggle with the silence and peace... and I also sometimes feel lost in it.
The PTSD constantly ""kept me busy"" and ""pushed me through the day"". Now I am left with all this freedom of having complete control over my day, what is amazing, but there is also no longer this PTSD-force pushing me. With the PTSD it sometimes felt like I got the smallest things done in a survival-mode and there were times when this survival-mode gave me the energy to do workloads that seemed impossible. Keeping myself busy 24/7 was a mechanism for me to avoid any thoughts about the trauma... Of course, at one point it eventually switched and the PTSD-symptoms became so strong that getting the smallest things done became a challenge.
Now I have complete control over my life again and I also do no longer have this disorder sucking my energy... but I also no longer have something pushing me. 

I need to find a new way to motivate myself and as ridiculous as it might sound, I struggle with this because I am also still in the process of trying to find out who I am now and what I enjoy doing.

Not sure if any of this even makes sense. Just wanted to share the small things I struggle with re-learning how to live a ""normal"" life."

diagnosedPTSD,My thoughts on society's approach to mental disorders,"During my PTSD healing journey, I started to struggle with society and how our society approaches mental issues. This post might be a bit off topic and what I write here is based on my *interpersonal trauma*.
I categorize these struggles in three categorizes:

**Our society encourages people to speak up about mental issues but is not willing to actually listen.** There's this huge movement of mental health awareness and activism encouraging individuals to speak up but after my personal experience speaking up, it all started to feel like virtue signalling to me. Encouraging others to speak up makes the person feel good but for the individual who actually opens up, it is devistating when they learn that the society that tells them to speak actually doesn't know how to deal with people that struggle with mental disorders. Being pushed away by those I felt comfortable enough to share my trauma with, because they didn't know how to react, was hurtful and led me to be afraid that others will now always see me for my PTSD and not for who I am.

I've came to the conclusion that mental health is openly discussed in our society and that's great, but mental disorders are not. A bad mental health does not equate the presence of a mental disorder. Mental disorders are a dysfunction of our brain/psyche like a dysfunction of an organ, while mental health is about self-care and going through normal emotional stages in life. **While society encourages talking about mental health but not mental disorders, there is a failure to differentiate between the two.** Diagnostic terms are now being used in the context of mental health and start to lose their meaning. Once I started talking about my PTSD, some people thought I just use the term as a buzzword and got a reaction that might be appropriate in the context of mental health but not in the context of a mental disorder. And once I elaborated, I felt treated like I am crazy although what I said is just what PTSD actually is.

Last but not least, I hate every quote on social media now that insinuates that people should put themselves and their needs first as well as that people are not responsible for the well-being of others. Of course, these quotes are not meant to justify people who physically harm others. Nonetheless, **I struggle with society insinuating that we are not responsible for our fellow human beings when our behavior and actions can turn a happy, functional individual into a broken person.** We cannot prevent ourselves from hurting others along the way, but we have a choice to treat others with respect. We need to believe in one another and help one another to heal. If we want a society in which not every second individual is a broken member of our group, we need to take responsibility.

Apologize the venting, I felt the need to write down my thoughts."

Me speaking to my father and others as well:
1. You canâ€™t talk your self out of it. Dad- Well, you can treat it right? Me- I can use the treatments available to help it, but I donâ€™t get a free pass to stop it.
2. Itâ€™s physical as well as mental. Dad- â€œWell, if itâ€™s mental you can get over itâ€ Me â€œNo, I get nightmares where I scream and punch things while sweating profusely tooâ€ I donâ€™t  just think about it all the time. 
3. Medicine is not bulletproof Dad-â€œWell, if you take the medicine and do therapy you should be fineâ€ Me- I am not just great, I am amazing. I have benefited greatly from treatment. But, I still canâ€™t make it go away. Sometimes my body puts out so much stress hormone that I still have symptoms despite the medicationâ€
4. I canâ€™t just make the world stop triggering me â€œYes, I can hide somewhere but that comes with itâ€™s own detriment. I have to treat the illness as it comes and keep making strides in the right direction.â€
5. No, itâ€™s not just â€œsymptomsâ€ Dad- â€œYa, I understand you have that. But itâ€™s just symptoms. It isnâ€™t like your leg is missing. Symptoms arenâ€™t a diseaseâ€ ðŸ˜µâ€ðŸ’«ðŸ¤®

UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  WHY!!!!!! I canâ€™t take it! Iâ€™m pissed. So pissed! Iâ€™m not letting it control me which is precisely why Iâ€™m treating it!

I developed PTSD because while at work I was sexually assaulted delivering the mail. I was outside and nobody was there to help me. Iâ€™m not weak. Iâ€™m traumatized!
Now, the Department of Labor is refuting the fact that I cannot go back to work there. That I didnâ€™t have a seizure because of sleep deprivation, coupled with the medication that I take for my PTSD. The hospital summary shows that these two factors caused my seizure. They even ran tests for 2 days while I was admitted and came to this conclusion. Workmanâ€™s Comp says â€œWell, those are symptoms. It doesnâ€™t say PTSD is the causeâ€ I have no income now. I would be making over $50000 a year if I go back. I would have sick leave and vacation time accumulated and good insurance.I would have all of this if I didnâ€™t have PTSD. HELL YA, Iâ€™m angry!

diagnosedPTSD,What being a victim of SA and having PTSD taught me â€“ from someone whoâ€™s in recovery,"Something Iâ€™ve only realized not too long ago was that Iâ€™ve imagined recovery from PTSD to feel like waking up from a nightmare in the sense that this all would go away. Therapy cannot erase these memories. Therapy cannot change the past. And thatâ€™s ok. I donâ€™t feel like I need to run away from my past anymore. I can accept now that what happened is part of my past.

Recovering from PTSD is just one part of the healing journey. Recovering from PTSD is indeed a very important part of it and key when it comes to returning to a normal life, but the PTSD was just one consequence of the SA and even the PTSD can lead to consequences. For example, my self-esteem and self-worth is still very low and something I have to work on.

Now that the PTSD symptoms are gone, my mental well-being does not depend on the bad things that happened to me. It depends on the good things and the lack thereof. The lack of people caring, the lack of people believing in me, the lack of people loving me despite what happened to me and despite the PTSD. It was not the SA that almost broke me, it was people thinking of me as a broken person and giving up on me."

Of course, it's probably difficult to explain how CPTSD differs from PTSD not based on diagnosis criteria but rather personal experience, because there's no personal experience to compare it to. Nonetheless, I hope that the following questions are a good starter:


- I have PTSD and the PTSD-diagnosis was a relief, because everything made sense. How did you feel about the PTSD-diagnosis and did you ever feel like the PTSD-diagnosis truly made sense? 

- How did it feel when you finally received the CPTSD-diagnosis?

- Did the PTSD-diagnosis ever truly help you understand what you're going through?

- Was the CPTSD-diagnosis important for your healing journey?

- How does the CPTSD-diagnosis positively impact your healing journey in a way the PTSD-diagnosis didn't?"

Last summer things briefly seemed to be going uphill (I was doing job that felt interesting, got paid enough and was doing things I thought I'd never be able to do again (1 day trips to New city for work, 11h days when needed,  learning many new things and most of all constantly meeting new people because of that work and being professional and normal, no anxiety for the most part). 

Then September and October crushed me, it was a constant battle against circumstances up and down like some awful merry go round of unpredictable impossible problems, finding solutions and then a new problem. By mid-November it felt like I was breaking but there were things to handle so I did what I could to help myself. A month later, I was starting to get so e balance and hope back.

And then New year just crushed me. And since then it's been uphill battle again. And there so much to do, and I can't seem to catch. The summer me would have been caught up in a week. But now it's like I'm in a fog and I don't know how February came. I keep pushing myself and I'm just getting more stuck, replacing one problem with another, one trigger for another, I'm trying to plan and do and be good and I'm just not. Every time I get paid important stuff get pushed over for other important stuff. My laptop is in a pawnshop and for 2 months I pay them a few so they can keep it another 30days because the fee is less than getting it back and I know ifi lose it I won't be able to afford such for years, and the one I work on has been falling apart for 5 years. Still, I have work and once I finish it I'll be able to get it back. But my deadline is this week (I can push the deadline but I get paid on completion and I need it). It's a good pay too and it would help me so much to try and move forward. But the week is crushing me. I had a trigger that hit me harder than it has happened in a year(literally lost few hours in distress and it felt like minutes). I got myself a nasty cold(not the virus but mot nice on a deadline). I just feel crushed and scrambled and steamroller. I know like this it sounds stupid and trivial, but I'm so lost right now and I have no outlet. It's like I'm surrounded by ticking time bombs and I Don know which will blow up in my face first.

I'm sorry, if you read until here. I'm just lost, and my motivation keeps going subzero. I feel either numb or too much, it's making me crazy."

diagnosedPTSD,How to deactivate my PTSD Somatic Memory?,"I have a memory of being covertly sexually assaulted as a young girl by my dad. A key part of the memory is the somatic feeling of my newly grown in leg hair being touched and commented on sexually.

Therefore, my own hairy legs are a trigger for me and bring me flashbacks of being sexually assaulted. Even me touching them brings up the trauma.

I don't want to shave my legs all the time to avoid a triggering memory. I also don't want to shave all the time bc it's time and money and energy spent better other places; I'd rather just shave periodically.

So I'm looking for ideas in how to heal this. I want to be able to have and touch my legs regardless of the state of their hair and not be triggered into a flashback. Anyone have ideas?

I'm in ART - Accelerated Response Therapy - and we will work on this, but sometimes we can go a while between sessions for different reasons. And I'd like to work on it now."
diagnosedPTSD,Is There a Link Between PTSD and OCD?,
diagnosedPTSD,I need to get a haircut but I am worried about getting triggered.,"So when I was in high school, I finally decided to buzz off my luscious golden locks. I am a huge tomboy and always felt more comfortable being masculine presenting, even though I identify as female. To this day, I always feel more like ""me"" with buzzed hair (military-style almost) than with any other haircut.

My mother ended up being the one to cut my hair that first time, and she did in a way that to this day still haunts me. She had me keep my hair in a braid, then really roughly spent almost an hour trying to cut through it with dull scissors instead of just cutting my hair while loose. Then having me go wash it while my hair was wrecked like that. There were a whole lot of other things that went wrong (in addition to my mom being my abuser, so I was already terrified).

Then when I go to get a haircut at a dresser, I get talked down to and have the hair dressers spend so so long trying to convince me to take a feminine haircut. One time, I was done with arguing and said that if she really didn't feel comfortable using sheers, she can use scissors. Charged me $70 for a haircut that should have been $20. 

So I still feel more comfortable with buzz hair. I feel more confident and stronger. But I am so terrified of getting a haircut. I don't want to get another episode because I am scared of confrontation. This is important to me, but I also feel so silly about being terrified by a haircut. My mom isn't even the one giving the haircut! I also don't want to get pressured into taking a haircut I don't want, just to avoid arguing. 

I had been planning to go today to a nearby Supercuts, but I am literally shaking right now. I know a haircut can seem kind of silly, but advice would be appreciated. I don't have any friends or family to go to for this. >.<"

diagnosedPTSD,Doing things i wasn't allowed to do,"My parents were very strict individuals, this affected a lot of the experiences I had as a child. I wasn't allowed to have a lot of foods, wasn't allowed to watch a lot of shows, and was generally fairly isolated from my peers. Lately, I've been trying to do more things that I wasn't allowed to do as a kid, both of the way to heal my inner child, and prove to myself that sometimes my mom's voice in my head is not right.

About a week ago I had my first bowl of SpaghettiOs made by my boyfriend. I spent a long time just playing with it and staring at it, but with his encouragement I managed to eat about half of it. Well it's definitely not something I'd eat again, I'm happy I did it. I also bought myself a box of gushers, because that's another thing I wasn't allowed to have. I bought myself a cat onesie because I wasn't allowed to make 'frivolous' purchases. Hell, lately I've been staying up past my bedtime on weekends, just a silly little act of rebellion.

I don't know why, but this genuinely seems to be helping. I've always been very insecure about the fact that I'm very sheltered and so frequently I'm unable to relate to the people around me. I haven't watched a single episode of SpongeBob, the first time I watch Shrek was as an adult. Now, one by one, I'm letting myself do the things that weren't allowed at home, and it feels quite nice."
diagnosedPTSD,How PTSD affects the people you love (TW for those with PTSD),"I've lost my relationship due to PTSD. I didn't know at that time what it was and didn't seek help.
After being diagnosed with PTSD I reflected a lot on the relationship and to this day I struggle with guilt for what my ex-partner went through. I know it is not my fault and I would never suggest anyone with PTSD should be criticized for having a mental disorder. So I don't necessarily recommend those with PTSD to watch the video as I don't want anyone to feel guilty for suffering in front of their loved ones because we need our loved ones to help us through this difficult time.
Nonetheless, I've decided to post the video because it describes how I felt seeing my partner suffering because he wasn't able to help me and someone here might feel the same way. It may also helps loved ones to know that they are allowed to acknowledge that they are suffering too due to the PTSD even if it is indirectly and that they need to take care of their own mental health as well."

This means strict rules and basically no friends (only conditional love).

My father was fun when I was very little, but suddenly stopped paying attention to me.

Mother probably has (undiagnosed!) Borderline Personality Disorder (this is what my therapist thinks).
She had crazy moodswings and blames everything on others.
She also badmouthed my father, wich resulted in me hating this man (wich I'm now realising and slowly resolving).

Mother once told me she wished I was never born.
I was their unexpected, unwanted third child.
And laughed about my suicidal thoughts at the time.

They have never had a good marriage, but stay together because JW's cannot get divorced.
Our household was a warzone.

I got bullied at school.
And was sexually abused by my brothers.

I've been going to my therapist since I was 16, until I was 18 I think, mostly to keep my head above water and not k* myself.

I moved out at 19 and realised I needed help, so I went back.
Been in therapy for around 3-4 years now. (I'm 23).

diagnosedPTSD,To everyone who is wondering if they have PTSD,"You are probably well aware that nobody here can make an official diagnosis for you, but you may nonetheless would like to hear the opinion of someone that suffers from PTSD. You may donâ€™t want to have to wait for months to finally get an appointment. You may do not have the financial means or access. You may feel ashamed to open up to a stranger in real life. You may fear that you are overreacting and seek confirmation that your suffering is severe enough to contact a psychologist/psychiatrist.

I understand why you would like to hear someoneâ€™s opinion here or why you are scrolling through the posts looking for a similar experience. However, Iâ€™d like to explain to you why this might not be a good idea. Our own experience doesnâ€™t make us experts. 

PTSD is diagnosed based on the nature of event you've experienced (Trauma) as well as the symptoms you are suffering from.
Just because you struggle with a past experience, it doesnâ€™t automatically mean that you suffer from PTSD. In the context of PTSD, there is a quite specific definition to the term Â«TraumaÂ» and if your experience doesnâ€™t meet that definition, you wonâ€™t be diagnosed with PTSD regardless of the symptoms you have.
Whether your experience does meet that definition or not is up to an expert to decide.
Neither you or we can make that determination, because we donâ€™t know your life story. We donâ€™t know if you share everything with us about that experience or not. We donâ€™t know if you downplay what happened. So when you get the answer from us that your experience doesnâ€™t meet the definition of Trauma, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that you donâ€™t have PTSD. At the same time is it possible that you unconsciously exaggerate the event because it becomes a proxy for another issue you struggle with.
If your experience meets the definition of Trauma, it doesnâ€™t automatically mean that you have PTSD. PTSD is just one of several mental disorders that we can suffer from after experiencing Trauma. The symptoms of mental disorders are often overlapping with other mental disorders and therefore a differential diagnosis is important. It could also be that there is comorbidity. So when you read about our symptoms here and they do not fully align with yours, it could be because it is another mental disorder or because you or the person who has written the post suffers from more than one mental disorder following a traumatic event.
And keep in mind when you read posts here that you canâ€™t be sure that they really have PTSD (f.e. factitious PTSD).

Even with all of this in mind, the responses you get from us when you ask us if what you have sounds like PTSD or when you read about our experiences, it will ultimately influence you and may even affect your mental health.

**And last but not least: When you scroll through these posts, something you read could trigger you. Not just trigger you, but you suddenly remember a lot more of what happened. This could put you in a very dark place. So if you think you don't remember exactly what happened, don't do this to yourself! Putting the memories together is something that needs to be done in therapy, so that the therapist can be there for you when these memories come back. No matter how strong you think you are, there is a reason why we suppress these memories.**

If you find yourself in this subreddit, you clearly struggle. It doesnâ€™t matter if it is PTSD or not, you need to contact a licensed professional because you are suffering."

Breathe through it."
alcoholism,,"Started the New Year with a bang. Hey, I'm new here, 22F. 
Last night started out simple enough. Having a few drinks with my on and off again boyfriend of two years, then his dad and sister wanted to go out to a bar, which I didn't really want to do, but I wanted them to spend time together. At this point I had had 3 Moscow mules...and had three double rum and cokes at the bar. 

Felt awkward...I'm sitting in the bar, and all of a sudden it hit me. Apparently I stopped talking and was just staring into space, weirding people out. To be honest, that's where it starts to get blurry. Then, I just have the sudden urge to leave. So without telling anyone that I'm leaving, I just dip out. The house is only a couple blocks from the bar, so I think I can do it . 

Cue the very blurry flashbacks of me falling onto the pavement multiple times, struggling to get up. At one point I lost my glasses, my ID, my debit card, my juul...
I stumble up to what looks like the house, I'm trying to get in but the door is locked and I'm just wrestling with the door.

So I sit down against the car in the driveway. My boyfriend calls me, asks where I am. Me, still being very drunk, says I'm at his house. He's freaking out, because I'm not there. About an hour later I stand up and realize I'm on the wrong side of the street. 

My legs are bleeding, I hit my head a couple times. I've been crying. 
He starts freaking out at me..he tries to talk to me, but I just stare at him...Im just shocked. I call a friend to come get me. He wrestles my phone out of my hand. I start crying again, not talking at all, and he screams at me to get out of his house. He and his sister pack my stuff and I stand on the sidewalk to wait for my ride. My friend shows up, picks me up and takes me to her place. My knee is really bad. Looks like it needs stitches. 

I wake up to find he's blocked me on everything. Says what happened was unforgivable, I ruined not just his night, but his family's night,  and tells me to stay out of his life. 

It's been 12 hours since I've woken up. My body is still so, so sore. I singlehandedly ruined my relationship in two hours, lost my best friend, and I've almost cried like five times today. 

I can't do this anymore. I've always drank socially, went kind of heavy last year, I got a DWI...I'm just so tired of waking up like this, over and over again."

So from this point on Iâ€™m going to take my sobriety seriously. Start going to meetings, maybe go to therapy.

alcoholism,,"The day I decided it was over Hey all! I am new to this community and so deciding to share my story, in the hope it can resonate with even one person who can relate! I am 27 years old, 2020 would have marked my 10th year of drinking. I have had a drinking problem since I was about 20 years old. Around this time I also developed generalised anxiety disorder and later social anxiety disorder (my drinking mainly contributed to this). For as long as I can recall I have always had underlying mental health issues, but these were completely manageable and didn't impact my life before I started drinking. It is almost impossible to take a step back and see the damage your drinking is causing you and those closest to you, because abusing alcohol completely robs you of your perception, any empathy for others and your sense of self, as well as money which you work too hard for to drink away to feel like crap anyway! I urge anyone suffering in a similar way to take that step back and use it as inspiration to make a positive change now! No matter your age no matter if you are in a better or worse situation than me! I have had 1 or 2 sober spells in the last 10 years of 6 weeks and 2 months sober, I felt so happy and free during these times, but always felt like I was missing something during it.. In hindsight I can say with absolute certainty that I wasn't! When I went back to drinking after these spells I hit it worse than ever. I did dumber shit and hated myself more and more. I've gotten into multiple fights when drunk (which is completely out of character for me), my fiancee left me months before we were due to be married because of my drinking, and I have lost many friends through actions and words used when I am under the influence. The day I decided it was over was just a few days ago at my friend's house, I completely blacked out and have no recollection, but suffered a head injury from a drunken fall. This caused a severe concussion and I have had to miss a week of a job I have just began and I'm now in danger of losing! I have decided once and for all I am never drinking again. I know for a fact that should I choose to drink ever again, it could be life or death, I will never be the guy who can just have 1 or 2 drinks I always feel I need to get shitfaced! I have subconsciously been waiting on a wake up call for years and now I have it. I urge any of you with a similar toxic relationship with alcohol to try and intervene before things get to this stage, or to seek help! If you are reading this it is absolutely not too late to change. Fuck what anybody thinks of your decision. Most of all do it for yourself, those closest to you will also benefit! My injury could have been much worse, brain damage could have occured (if it hasn't anyway and I don't yet know) I could ultimately be dead in the worst case scenario, and the thought of putting my family through that is enough to make me finally stop drinking for good. Had things panned out slightly differently I wouldn't be writing this post right now. In my eyes I am a very lucky man with one last chance to do the right thing, to stop robbing myself of happiness and a live a life independent of the binge drinking hell I've been living through during the last 10 years.

It started innocently enough,  a few extra drinks, then drinking every weekend, and next thing I knew I was drinking every single day. I've had it with feeling like crap all the time and blowing off friends to drink. Tired of the anxiety my drinking caused me. Just tired. So here's to my new beginning!"

Past 3 weeks, had 3 sober days. And I think I can if I get through the shakes and nausea and everything else as I detox. This was such a stupid idea to start. So, so so so so stupid. Gotta kick in the butt now as a newbie instead of getting worse.

I hate myself for this."
alcoholism,,"Does anyone else feel like they are not taken seriously (maybe as seriously) with the nausea and up heaving constantly with their withdrawals? From family members to ER to ICU to detox it seems they just kind of want me to go through it because it is not as life-threatening as seeing ""shadow people"" or hearing stuff that isn't there which I do as well but when I ""stabilize"" I cannot eat even thought they want me to.  They ask my symptoms every so often and would only give me things like Ativan when the walls were crawling.  

If if upheave too much it makes my chest hurt and I see stars.  Or will choke on my vomit.  

Anyways I am out of ICU but still feel like shit and going to see if can get into proper detox tomorrow.  I am already in an IOP program but I had a relapse over Christmas so I am trying to get better.  And probably jeopardized my new job from not being able to tell them I was in the ICU during it.  

BTW does it also make anyone feel better when they are in fresh air while withdrawling?

alcoholism,,"Day 9. No rest. It's the 9. day since my last drink and I can't sleep. I feel like I am stuck in my weird dreams for aeons and when I wake up, only an hour or less has passed. Sometimes I am dreaming with my eyes open, see furniture move, shadows. Even heard a woman's voice in my bedroom. I live alone.
This has never happened before and I am afraid of the night, afraid to close my eyes and afraid to fall asleep.
When I talk to my doctor he would just say ""relax, detox is hard on body and psyche. it will get better."" It just doesn't change the fact, that it's scary and that I feel helpless at night.

Fortunately my days are better than my nights. Although I've got the common cold (the nights were getting worse before I got ill) I eat well, I get lots of fluids and I am kindling my passion for literature. 

Is there anyone who has experienced something similar during detox? Rationally I assume that it could be a sum of all things. Recent break-up, dark seasons, holiday stress, and detox.

I was a regular drinker until recently. Probably consuming on average 8 units a night. Over time I think this affected my mental health. I had my last drink on New Yearâ€™s Eve.

Yesterday I felt a massive sense of anxiety which lasted for a couple of hours or so. I honestly thought I was going to have a panic attack. So many negative emotions came out of no where and I think alcohol was to blame because over Xmas I drunk every day because I planned on stopping on New Yearâ€™s Eve. 

Anybody experience this? If so when does it stop. I feel like itâ€™s coming on again. I have no desire to drink by the way, just annoyed at my state of being.

My mother and brother are there with him. The doctors told him he was lucky to have survived and if he doesn't stop drinking he will die. soon. According to my mom and brother he is not very receptive to this.

I don't really know what to do. Obviously he needs to stop drinking and being a former addict myself (unknown to them) I understand how impossible that will seem to him. I just really want to sort my thoughts and find a way to get through to him when I drive down next week to talk to him."

I am 30m, let myself go on a bender that has only lasted 14 days but all my symptoms of withdrawal are bad. I basically drank straight through the holidays and am waking up hurting and In need of support. I immediately got myself back up to like 16 a day? Idk even know I was just getting as much as made me glow so I was making multiple trips to the store, usually 6 drinks at a time, three times a day but for the life of me I couldnâ€™t tell you how many I had yesterday, probably 16. I drink bourbon by choice, cheap beer if I canâ€™t get it.


I called out of work so much this week I probably lost my job, I have two kids who live with me and my wife is furious, I have enough money where not working for a week shouldnâ€™t ruin us but I need to end this. Any ideas on detoxing? I can get into med spot but Iâ€™ve been there and itâ€™s three days of misery Iâ€™m avoiding because itâ€™ll suck. I feel like I can do this at home because it was a short run, my wife is on the fence, she is well versed in alcohol detox but certainly no nurse and Iâ€™ve had some bad symptoms. Worst for me is the hammering heart, I have had some moments in the middle of the night before the packie opens where Iâ€™ve prob had some dt symptoms of being delusional and scared but idk, has anyone picked themselves up from bender like this without med detox? Best choice is obviously to make sure I donâ€™t die but hard taper sounds just as bad. I can probably get gabapentin but no benzos to be had. All the other symptoms are there, sweats, shakes but not too critical and some fear/delusional moments where Iâ€™m scared of my own shadow and light and loud sounds are scary. Anybody else clean up at home from a bender this short?

I've kinda stopped using reddit, I don't think this is the place to completely change shit but I've alienated myself a bit and I'm also pretty ashamed to speak about this with anyone in my life. Without some community though I don't know if I can fix anything.

Recently I've been drinking a lot, like every single day a lot, I think some of that has been exacerbated by my current partner drinking very frequently. While I have trouble with that it doesn't seem to affect his work or life so let's just leave that one aside for now. 

The problem is me. Quite simply, and I don't know how much the liquor is to blame it's been a wild ride of a year, I've become a fucking piece of shit person. I'm volatile and angry and frankly I've behaved fucking horrifically the past few months. I've started blacking out and forgetting how bad it is too and then having to try and navigate how it affects the people around me without asking them exactly what has happened. It needs to stop and I'm not sure where to start. Part of the problem is that the fallout just means I detest myself overall - I am finding it very hard to see redemption as a possibility for myself. I am quite scared of where this is headed.

I'm not going to be able to abstain entirely and I'm not going to work toward that right now. I am going to try and slow down. 

But the reason I'm here is more to understand how to start figuring this out. Has anyone here experienced the same thing? How does this work? What can I start doing to stop behaving this way, short of cutting alcohol out of my life entirely? How do I reconcile how I've behaved with who I am? On that last point, how do I feel like I'm still a person after the damage I've done?

Any advice would be really appreciated."
alcoholism,,"My boyfriend who lives across the country from me just admitted heâ€™s an alcoholic. What should I do? Over the summer my long-term boyfriend moved across the country to attend university for the year. Weâ€™re committed to each other and for have a pretty amazing relationship. For awhile Iâ€™ve noticed he seems to have a complex relationship with alcohol. He seems to use it to help him cope with stressful situations as well as when his mental health gets him down. Iâ€™ve never brought this up to him because it was only suspicions. He is successful, productive and I rarely saw him using alcohol to cope, I would just find little clues or get snippets in conversations. Perhaps I should have addressed this head on and much earlier. I feel like Iâ€™ll always regret not doing that for him 

Anyways, thatâ€™s the backstory. He called me early this morning and broke down. He told me heâ€™s not returning to school this upcoming semester as the financial stress is too much (he goes to a private institute and has to pay a very high tuition monthly) and that because of the financial stress heâ€™s been under trying to come up with tuition and his chosen coping mechanisms heâ€™s become an alcoholic. He cried when he told me and it absolutely broke my heart. He said heâ€™s going to go to an AA meeting this weekend and told me one of our friends there will take him. He has a plan for work and is going to start that Monday instead of returning to school. He is super worried about having to tell his family and friends that heâ€™s not finishing his program and he feels like a failure. Iâ€™m devastated for him. Heâ€™s the most wonderful person I know and I wish I was able to be physically there with him through this. I told him I love him and Iâ€™ll be by his side no matter what. He was seeing a therapist here before he moved but hasnâ€™t since. Iâ€™m going to encourage him to find someone there in the next week as I think thatâ€™s an important piece of this for him. I guess Iâ€™m reaching out to see if thereâ€™s anything I should do, advice, resources, anything that will allow me to best support and help him through this. Thank you in advance â™¥ï¸

alcoholism,,"Quitting drinking? Quitting alcohol?

30 days of drinking? 

Been at it just about everyday since the week of thanksgiving.  I plan to go the first half of â€˜20 completely sober. 

I want to get in the best shape of my life, have several critical moments as a professional, and want to save money! 

Worried however of withdrawals, I wonâ€™t experience anything crazy will I? What can be done to alleviate this? 

I had blood work done the week before thanksgiving, all came back completely normal. 

My level of consumption during this period has been 4-7 drinks a day. 

I started a taper after last night 6 drinks, today I had 4, tomorrow 2, Friday, Saturday, Sunday none... 

The discipline isnâ€™t an issue and I could quit cold turkey, but am a little nervous of withdrawals. 

For full history, I was drinking daily 4-6 beers for approx 2 years. Basically all of 2019, I consumed 10-12 **TOTAL** on the weekends. Abstained during the weekdays. Then the week of thanksgiving, the holiday parties kicked off. I think since 11/22 Iâ€™ve had only 3-4 off days. 

7 is definitely on the high end above. Using conservative measures. Iâ€™d say 6 is near my max. But want to be as honest as possible here and there were some days I stayed around 4-5.

Everybody is different. Iâ€™ve found that I was able to quit cold turkey a few times by enduring work throughout a new week. Kept me distracted enough to not experience severe withdrawal symptoms. And by the end of the week, youâ€™re on day 5. Unfortunately, that happens to be when my symptoms subside so I would fall victim to my own healthy-feeling and justify myself a drink. Iâ€™m going into day 4 currently after going on a binge during the holidays. Sunday and Monday were very rough and I was riddled with anxiety. Feeling better already with subtle anxiety but Iâ€™ve been here before. Longest Iâ€™ve gone without a drink in the past 4 years has been 15 days. I KNOW I can do better.

On new years eve I saw him for the first time drunk, he got so drunk it really scared me off ( not that he was mean or something but I personally don't drink so I am kinda afraid of drunk people as they are unpredictable). I also have never been with such a drunk person so I was simply overwhelmed by the whole situation. After he puked, he straightly went to bed to sleep. I was lying next to him for the next few hours to control his breathing. All in all what happened that night was honestly not easy for me to handle, seeing the person you love the most like that hurts so bad. The next morning he told me that he is so sorry and that I shouldn't have seen him like that. I really love him and except of his drinking problem he is perfect to me but I'm afraid of what will happen next. He is such a great person and I don't want to leave him, as drinking was a result of his depression. He drinks for a reason and I can't blame him because I know what depression feels like. I'm just so afraid that he starts drinking daily again. Also what is happening right now triggered my depression and it just sucks.

So me- 37m, 6'3 230lbs, and fit (believe it or not).  I've averaged ~4L/week of hard alcohol for like 8 years.  I 95% stopped drinking 3 weeks ago on a 'whim'- my guts were hurting.  That stopped almost immediately.  

So, my experience so far hasn't matched what i'd believed with recovering alcoholics.  I'm casually tempted to go buy some booze, but it wasn't a huge temptation after the first week.  I've had 1 beer in a social setting a few times, and there hasn't been any impulse to drink more.  I didn't feel bad in the slightest those first few days of sobriety, i felt awesome.  Like, damn i wish i'd stopped years ago.

I've only heard 'once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.'  I don't want to go back to nightly drinking, but i'd like to get drunk again in the future.  In the right setting.  Based on how i feel today and how easy it was to stop, it seems like it would be no big deal... but i don't know.

How long before my liver recovers, as much as it will?

How typical is my experience?

Is this all indicative that i didn't have a chemical dependency, just a psychological one?

Why didn't i have any withdrawls when i was drinking so much?  Just size and activity level?


I didn't intend to be here, and i'm sure i sound dumb.  Honestly, i'd appreciate any comments, anecdotes, insults, anything.  I don't really want to talk about this with people in the real world because... y'all prolly get why.

Thanks"

alcoholism,,"I need help. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like a failure Iâ€™m 27F. I started drinking a little after me and my high school sweetheart started dating around 17/18 years old. His family was pretty big into drinking and my mom was always so strict about it since my dad and his family had a history of alcoholism. When me and bf would drink sometimes it would be great but if there was an argument things would go left FAST. We thought maybe it was just something weâ€™d grow out of since it wasnâ€™t frequent. 
When we turned 20 we got married and moved to another state. There were already infidelity issues and I never got any closure from that before we tied the knot so I was left still hurt and the drinking continued. Iâ€™d sometimes get violent and so would he when I provoked him enough (I know that was never right. I was hurt and I didnâ€™t know how to process my emotions in a healthy way) 
The fiery arguments stopped but the cheating/lying didnâ€™t so we called it quits after 6 years or marriage. That alone took a lot out of me because giving up on something/someone I cared so deeply about made me feel like a failure so the drinking continued.

alcoholism,,"Could two weeks of moderate (3-5 drinks) have resulted in withdrawals the next days as a non-drinker? Hi, 

I typically don't drink at all, but have drank almost nonstop in the last two weeks, roughly 3-5 regular, standard unit sized drinks each night, and though I'm not 100% sure if something else has occurred with respect to my medications which I had tapered off at a similar time (still attempting to determine) it's still odd.

 I've felt persistent anxiety and elevated heart rates in the daytime (palpitations even), somewhat ""wired"" in the daytime, sometimes trouble sleeping - all since about day 3. 

Does this seem unreasonable to expect withdrawals even as someone who does not drink and only recently began, or is this possible? Obviously there will always be some extent of withdrawals as the body adapts the next day, but I suppose I'm curious if it is possible to this extent for someone who seldom drinks (quite noticeable)."

We live in MA. I plan to section 35 her because I firmly believe she is a danger to herself and others. She doesn't have a police record yet but I have recently found out she would drive drunk and drink in her car which is terrifying. She has also admitted to wanting to die when she was intoxicated. 

When bringing her into detox at a local hospital, she has stated suicidal tendencies to the nurse questioning her. I believe that should be within her medical record or some sort of report somewhere we could access (either me or my brother are her proxy). 

I'm just trying to figure out where to begin, what my next steps should be. I have never done this before. I'm reading up on it now, wondering what kind of evidence I would need to bring since she doesn't have any sort of police record. I called her case manager and left a message. I haven't heard back yet.

I have already lost 1 parent, I refuse to lose another even if that means she hates me. Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

alcoholism,,"Made my one year mark Today is one year since I quit. Three months of AA followed by just being alive and not drinking. It hasnâ€™t all been smooth sailing. At times I would feel my mouth water watching a commercial. But, I did it.   


now what?  Thatâ€™s an honest question I have asked myself. I'm proud of myself for making this year. But, Iâ€™m not sure what I want for this next year. I know that I wonâ€™t panic so much if something is cooked in alcohol. I know I can walk away from a drink. what I donâ€™t know is if I will ever pick up a drink again. For today, I wonâ€™t, I work all weekend. What about Monday?  And how will I feel when my family stares at me if I have that Bloody Mary.   


I took some good things from AA and one day at a time is one of them. I carry my chip with me. Like a talisman. For this one day I wonâ€™t drink. I donâ€™t want to pick up another 24 hou

alcoholism,,"Horrible digestive issues that donâ€™t go away when Iâ€™m sober. I started drinking heavily over 10 years ago. I was also drinking a lot of soda with booze. I developed some horrible digestive issues as a result. Iâ€™ve now been diagnosed with IBS and GERD.

It constantly feels like my digestion is on fast forward and food often travels right through me. I get hot flashes, cold chills, itchy skin, feel sensitive to touch and other unpleasantness after eating, when I exercise, when I take a shower, after waking up from a nap ect. All of which trigger my IBS.

Iâ€™ve managed to get sober a few times. My record is 3 months. In that time I saw practically no improvement in my symptoms. Iâ€™ve tried diets, medications, supplements ect. and nothing helps my symptoms.

Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ve done some permanent damage to my gut. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? My digestion was never as bad as this before I started drinking."

My mother stopped drinking about 8 years ago and I'm really proud of her but, my father continued. Recently he received his second OVI and is now on probation. At any moment they can test his blood, hair or urine to see if he's drank. If he gets caught, he goes to jail. The last 5 weeks my father has been sober. I've never met sober Dad before and it's a HUGE change. He's doing dishes, spending time with us, cleaning his room (parents don't sleep in the same room) and so much more. Yesterday he gifted my son with a picture of him photoshopped onto the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and I was shook. So here's my question, how do I best support my father on this new journey even though it's been forced upon him? After his probation is up, I don't want him to relapse. I want to show that this ""new"" person is the person I've wanted to meet my whole life. That even though he's always been my hero, that I can trust him to be alone &amp; responsible with my 4 children and now be there hero as well.

alcoholism,,Alcoholic father in law. This is my first time posting. I got married 3 years ago and moved in with my in laws. I knew my FIL was an alcoholic before we got married however I didnâ€™t realize how bad it actually was. He goes on 1-2 week benders of straight drinking and not going to work. During this time we have to be extra quiet so he doesnâ€™t wake up and the mood in the house is very negative and stressed my husband out which he takes out on me. I am so sick of this cycle. I donâ€™t know what to do. Rehab is out of the question. My mother In law has co dependency issues and also doesnâ€™t know what to do. Any suggestions? Ultimatums are the only thing I can think of.

I had met someone that I really liked, went on a couple of dates and got blackout drunk and made up ridiculous lies. The guy ghosted me. I texted him and he finally said because it was lie after lie. My heart fell into my stomach. I felt so ashamed. The only thing I could do was sincerely thank him, own up to it, and admit I needed to be sober.

alcoholism,,"I decided to stop drinking and two days in, my SO wants me to have drinks and try to control After several times telling her I canâ€™t control my drinking and that I have to stop, she decided that itâ€™s not fun if I donâ€™t drink. For example we are going to a restaurant with friends and sheâ€™s concerned that our friends would feel uncomfortable if I donâ€™t drink with them. So, sheâ€™s inviting me back to drinking with her and to see if I can try to control it. Obviously this is all messed up. She really does care about me but obviously not as much as I had thought ? What should I say to her here?  This is crazy because like two days ago I experienced the â€œstraw that broke the camels backâ€ when I got wasted alone with our three year old son and was followed home by some folks that saw me stumbling around the city dangerously crossing roads etc and spoke to our doorman about my behavior (I thankfully arrived safely) and they told him that they were about to call the cops etc. I was so embarrassed. I promised myself and my wife that this was it. And now, sheâ€™s pulling me back in. Iâ€™m just going to tell her â€œnoâ€ and that if she loves me truly then she has to cope with it.

alcoholism,,"My husband just admitted to me that he suffers from alcoholism Long story short, my husband admitted to me finally, of his own volition that he is dependent on alcohol. Iâ€™ve known this for quite some time, but I know that this is something he has to come to terms with himself and I canâ€™t make him change or give him to desire to stop. Obviously I suggest ways he can work on it, offering up different ways to cope, etc. He also suffers from depression and anxiety which he opened up about a few months ago and has since gone on medication and began seeing a therapist. These have helped, but the overall addiction has always been there. Far before we were together he has struggled with this, but it would come in waves. He can go days/weeks without a drink, but he can never just have 1. Fights have escalated due to alcohol, I get impatient with drunk behavior from him, and I get embarrassed if it happens when we are around other people. The most important part is, Iâ€™m 5 months pregnant with our first child. I want to support him as best I can, but I canâ€™t convince him to change. What is the best first step I can take? Suggesting meetings to go to together, confiding in family to help? Iâ€™m unsure of how to deal with any of this while still being supportive."
alcoholism,,"Can an alcoholic just stop loving their significant other by quitting alcohol? My alcoholic ex and I broke up a couple months ago. He was actively drinking throughout our relationship. One week after he stopped drinking, he went from all the â€œi love youâ€ and â€œI canâ€™t imagine my life without youâ€ to â€œi donâ€™t love you anymoreâ€, and has been like that ever since. Heâ€™s been sober (or dry? he refuses to get help and claims he can do it on his own) for a little over a month now.

Itâ€™s killing me to think that the love was genuine on my end, but it was only because of alcohol on his end and thatâ€™s why he was able to stop so easily the moment he quit drinking. I donâ€™t know too much about how recovery works, so i donâ€™t know if this is for now while heâ€™s detoxing, or if this is for real. Does it really work like that? Can an alcoholic completely stop loving you after just a week of sobriety?"

alcoholism,,"New here and scared of what my actions of drinking have turned into Hi there, I just need some guidance. 21 year old male in college. 

Small backstory: I found myself starting to drink harder and much more often once my ex-girlfriend cheated on me in July. I was piss drunk for about 2 weeks straight and have found myself drinking every day since it happened, and havenâ€™t gone without a drink maybe 5-7 days since July. Before this all happened, I only drank on the weekends. Now I canâ€™t even imagine not drinking in some sort of way. 

It stirred me into confusion about my future and if I should even stay in school. It has really deterred my grades and have had many drunken mistakes that wouldâ€™ve never happened before. 

I knew this became a problem once I started missing work from being too hungover and sleeping through work. I didnâ€™t even tell them I wasnâ€™t coming in, only to continue to drink for the rest of the day. 

All I think about is when I can drink next and how much of my money I am putting towards booze this week. 

I want to figure out ways to curb this. It sounds like Iâ€™m becoming an alcoholic and would love some actual guidance from people who may have experience with this. 

Anything helps, thank you."
alcoholism,,"Is this what being an alcoholic can be like? I've been drinking since I was about 15 and am 25 now.

I know I'm not a lightweight because the nights that that miraculously doesn't happen I've consumed a pretty decent amount. But the thing is, I feel compelled socially and habitually that I have to drink if I'm going out somewhere on a weekend night and I almost get anxiety thinking about not. I've definitely done some dumb stuff on alc and gotten myself into trouble but it doesnt regularly interfere with my life, just on the weekends.

It's been 70 days since my last post, and I now have 110 days sober.  I have learned so, so much.

I have so much to say, but you already know it, and this probably isn't the place.  Since I began my journey two of my closest, oldest friends- drinking buddies, of course- have also begun their own walks to recovery, inspired by nothing but the changes they've seen in me.

I am not the person I was 70 days ago, or 110 days ago, or the person I was through 22 years of drink.  I am a new person, more like I once was but mature and confident, and for the first time in my life I understand what it feels like to love myself, to accept myself, to forgive myself, to love others without judgment as well.

I love the life ahead as a dad for the most part, but also am scared to face such a big life change. I feel ashamed that I let myself use the crutch of drinking to deal with the bigness of the situation and my self-doubt about being able to rise to the challenge of fatherhood. I woke up this morning, trying conceal yet another hangover, and vowed that I had to get this shit back under control â€” not only for my health but so this beautiful little kid has the kind of caring, loving dad he deserves.

Yesterday I read this passage from VALIS by Philip K. Dick and it seemed very interesting to me. This morning I went to an AA meeting and I realized why: the experience of anhedonia/disillusionment (nothing is fun or meaningful or happy) that I have been feeling is very real. Not only because Iâ€™ve been numbing myself with alcohol, but because Iâ€™ve been actively destroying myself to feel a sense of control. Giving myself an excuse not to try. I could easily drink myself to death in the struggle to escape my own feelings of existential dread and helplessness. From small things like not being able to control alcoholism (so I binge drink and make the question irrelevant) to less tangible things like struggling to cope with my mortality or feelings of impotence.

Even sometimes the disease itself can be a crutch, something for us to focus on. I donâ€™t really have a relationship with a â€œhigher powerâ€ yet (Iâ€™m only a week sober...hopefully it will come) but I really feel like this seems to hit the nail on the head re: admitting we are powerless. 

Anyway, I thought you might enjoy. I apologize in advance for the wall of text; I transcribed it as it is written (no paragraph breaks.)

â€œIn his study of the form that masochism takes in modern man, Theodor Reik puts forth an interesting view. Masochism is more widespread than we realize because it takes an attenuated form. The basic dynamism is as follows: a human being sees something bad which is coming as inevitable. There is no way he can halt the process; he is helpless. This sense of helplessness generates a need to gain some control over the impending painâ€”any kind of control will do. This makes sense; the subjective feeling of helplessness is more painful than the impending misery. So the person seizes control over the situation in the only way open to him: he connives to bring on the impending misery; he hastens it. This activity on his part promotes the false impression that he enjoys pain. Not so. It is simply that he cannot any longer endure the helplessness or the supposed helplessness. But in the process of gaining control over the inevitable misery he becomes, automatically, anhedonic (which means being unable or unwilling to enjoy pleasure). Anhedonia sets in stealthily. Over the years it takes control of him. For example, he learns to defer gratification; this is a step in the dismal process of anhedonia. In learning to defer gratification he experiences a sense of self-mastery; he has become stoic, disciplined; he does not give way to impulse. He has *control*. Control over himself in terms of his impulses and control over the external situation. He is a controlled and controlling person. Pretty soon he has branched out and is controlling other people, as part of the situation. He becomes a manipulator. Of course, he is not consciously aware of this; all he intends to do is lessen his own sense of impotence. But in his task of lessening this sense, he insidiously overpowers the freedom of others. Yet, he derives no pleasure from this, no positive psychological gain; all his gains are essentially negative. 

(Continued on a different page)
â€œIn summary [...] the modern-day masochist does not enjoy pain, he simply canâ€™t stand being helpless.â€

alcoholism,,"Help....maybe I'm 44. I like to drink, love to drink. 
I drink every day.
At least 6 a day.
But I want to stop.
Lost my dad, started to drink....yes I know no excuse  and everyone looks for an excuse. 
Work got hard...
Mum got Ill....
Someone special to me let me down and turned back on me.
I drink every day....maybe the odd day I wont.
I used to run half marathons.....now I have no inclination. 
Just....help"
alcoholism,,"Embarrassed to go to an event. Last Spring I went with my boyfriend to a work event of his (his boss' birthday party). I got too drunk and made a huge idiot of myself. I fell, and apparently I said something not very nice to his manager, causing us to abruptly leave. I don't remember what happened and when I asked my boyfriend to apologize to his coworkers for me and try to find out what happened, the consensus was that a lot of people at that party were really drunk and no one remembers what happened, remembers seeing me fall, and his boss ""doesn't remember"" me being rude to him. My paranoid self if telling me that everyone is just being polite and not mentioning what happened, especially his boss. He was apparently pretty drunk too. All of this is supposed to make me feel slightly better about what happened, but it didn't. 

After that event I decided to stop drinking entirely. I have always had a problem with alcohol. It wasn't so much that I couldn't say no to a drink... I could go months without drinking. But when I start drinking, I just can't seem to stop, and always needed to be the drunkest person there. It does not help that I just wasn't a good drunk. I get angry quickly and just.. wasn't a good drunk. I have done so many things in my years of drinking (I am 27) that led to just awful decisions, awful outcomes and permanent, long-lasting negative things. 

It has been almost 8 months of no drinking and I have never been happier in my entire life. I love waking up after a party knowing exactly what happening, waking up without crippling anxiety about what I said or did. There have been times when it's been a little difficult and people press as to why I'm not having a drink. But I've learned how to react and respond in these situations. 

This started as a year of no drinking, but now that I have started this life, with how happy I am, I know I'm going to continue it. It would be nice to one day have control over how much I drink and be able to have one drink on a night out. But I don't see that happening right now because I am just so happy. My boyfriend (now fiance) and I are the absolute best we have ever been and everything else in my life is just falling into pieces. I honestly never realized how much those nights of drinking were adding to my overall anxiety. I would always lie to myself and say that I didn't have a problem, even after a night out that went horrible wrong that was meant to be just a night out with friends to get some drinks. I didn't know that this affected all of the aspects of my life. My career is booming, my mental and physical health are booming and all the relationships in my life seem.. clearer and better somehow. 

However, this upcoming weekend, I have a another work event for my fiance, a wedding of his coworker. All the same people will be there that were there last spring when I made a total ass of myself. I am so nervous. I keep telling myself that I have almost 8 months of evidence that I am not that person who they saw that night, and that I am working towards bettering my life. But no matter what, I think myself back into being nervous to see all of them. I'm nervous to see his boss, nervous to see his female coworkers that must have judged me for being such an ass. I wish I could cancel or play sick but I know I have to go. I don't know if I apologize or just leave it alone and have a good time... I'm just so nervous. And I'm also nervous for them to see that I'm not drinking at all and to judge that I can't drink otherwise I'll turn into the person they saw last time. I've come up with a hundred excuses why I can't go and feel like I'm being such a quitter."
alcoholism,,"Will I be taken seriously? I'm an 18 year old girl in my first year of university. I've only been drinking for a little over a year but I already feel I have a very destructive relationship with alcohol - I'm drinking at least 70 units of alcohol a week. A lot of that is alone in my dorm. I've arranged to go to our Universities student wellbeing service next week to talk about this but I'm afraid to go for a couple reasons. One, it's seen as normal in the UK to drink a lot in your first year of uni (especially in the north aha) Two, idk I feel like I don't really come across like the type of person who would be an alcoholic?? I'm a very meak and shy girl idk idk 

Does anyone has any tips to express to a counsellor that you think you really do have a problem? How to be taken seriously?"
alcoholism,,Not eating and alcoholism Does anyone else have trouble eating? I will feel hungry but the thought of eating makes my stomach upset. But I can keep drinking somewhat fine. Then in the mornings I wake up and puke for like 3 hours bc I didnâ€™t eat the day before. Does this happen to anyone else? It sucks because I have to force myself to eat and itâ€™s hard. And donâ€™t care about stopping none of those comments just wanna see if others have this trouble
alcoholism,,My head burns when I'm sober. Is this withdraw from the alcohol? Also what's the best way to look for rehab for alcoholism?
alcoholism,,"Need an alternative 18 year old here who has decided that he has a binge drinking problem. Been going out every weekend for a while now with going to uni, drinking seems inevitable. Now I've realised my behaviour while drunk is getting worse. I'm getting aggressive drunk and causing more and more problems most recently causing a scene at the local metro station. My most recent one is the reason why I now I think I have a problem. Originally just going out for a few drinks at 4 o clock in the afternoon ended up with me sleeping rough at 4 in the morning. Lost my wallet and contact with my friend who I was supposed to be staying with that night. I can't drink in moderation anymore, I always drink to the extreme. I want to stop drinking but I feel like I need an escape from regular life. 

I need to find an alternative activity to escape from normality has anyone got any suggestions."
alcoholism,,"In half an hour I will be 32 days sober! Just so glad I was able to make it this far, and look forward to racking up more months and eventually years."
alcoholism,,"Are there any alcoholics in here that don't like to get drunk? Do I have a problem? I like beer.  No, I *love* beer.  I also enjoy the occasional glass of red wine or scotch on the rocks.  But I rarely get drunk because I hate it.  I'll get tipsy from time to time, but that's about as far as I like to take it.

When I get home from work, the first thing I do is crack a beer.   I might have one or two more later throughout the evening.  I used to be worse, drinking until I had a buzz, but I've since cut way back.  On the weekends, I'll have 5-10 drinks, but I make sure to not cross that threshold of getting drunk.

On Saturdays, or vacation, I like to have a beer or two in the middle of the day but, again, I don't get drunk.

I find beer relaxes me.  Helps me destress from work and traffic, helps me to loosen up a little, plus I like trying all sorts of different beers (though, I usually drink cheap beer).

I'm in my mind twenties and over the past 3 years there has probably been only 15 of so days where I *haven't* had a drink.

I guess what I am trying to ask is: do I have a problem?"
alcoholism,,"The night sweats Will. Not.Stop Every night im sober,  multiple times a night I will wake up SOAKED in sweat. I've tried less clothes,  more clothes,  naked,  and a lighter blanket.  Nothing seems to help.  Is this a side effect of passing out drunk most nights? Does it go away after a period of sobriety?"
alcoholism,,"Going to an AA meeting on behalf of a parent Hi, my name is Li I'm 19 and I have a father who is an alcoholic. He's been trying to quit for years and I've been wondering if it is acceptable to attend an AA meeting myself beforehand to see if it'll be a good fit for him?"
alcoholism,,"The borderline I always experience that weird borderline between ""Well, this is a fun little buzz and I could stop right here"" and ""no, you must continue until the room is spinning and you're ready to lose consciousness."" What's going on on there? What do you do about it? I usually have enough common sense to just eat something nice, watch TV and go to bed, but not always....."
alcoholism,,"substances keep me alive the only thing i look forward to during the day is drinking and getting nicotine. i wake up, plan when i can drink, and vape. thatâ€™s all i like. iâ€™m not a heavy heavy drinker, but i need at least 1 beer and a shot or the equivalent to be truly happy that day. i know it can be worse, but this is really sad. my only plan right now is switching to weed. i have terrible ptsd. i cant work a normal job without seeing his face in other people. i cry every time. does weed really help?"
alcoholism,,I failed... (once again) This is my 3rd relapse over a 6 month period and I am just totally struggling. I can't seem to stop drinking.  AA is not working for me and I just feel exhausted at this point.   I just need to hear some motivation right now.   How is everyone else doing/feeling today?
alcoholism,,"Anyone else here like me? Extreme heavy binge drinker here just coming off a week long bender. Massive amounts of booze until my body can't take it anymore, but even then, I still drink more. I throw up and think I'll be successful with the next shot, but even if I'm not, I still try again. This might go on for days then when I'm finally done, I drink beer to minimize the withdrawal. I'm sick, dehydrated and can't sleep. My face is a dry mess peeling and cracking. Yet, knowing this is how I roll, I still want more. 

Just trying to figure out what I'm doing and why I do this. Maybe someone out there is similar."
alcoholism,,"Any resources to find the best doctor to help with detox? I had a pretty scary experience early last year. I was in the hospital for almost a month with horrible DTs. Not a fun experience. I was on a two week bender about an hour after discharging. After that two weeks I finally went to rehab, where they just detoxed me with Ativan for almost a week and I was completely fine. A little sweaty, still a tiny bit of tremors but absolutely nothing like the hospital experience. Iâ€™m still rather confused to if they just loaded me on so much medicine that made me have this experience.

Iâ€™ve been on a bad tear since about October. Iâ€™m putting down a handle of whiskey at home about every two days, and thatâ€™s not including the nightly trips to the bar which I canâ€™t even keep track of how much Iâ€™m putting down. I get a few sporadic hours of sleep here and there and just slowly sipping at home on jack and cokes just to zero out, and it starts to pick up at the bar even though Iâ€™m really not even getting drunk anymore...I just want to sleep.

Iâ€™m absolutely terrified to go to the hospital and detox because I do NOT want to lose another month of my life that I didnâ€™t even realize I did. Does anyone know if there are any resources online to maybe narrow down a doctor a can speak with first in my area that specializes or maybe just knows a bit more about the subject and can just give me a check up and see what my best options are if doing this at home?"
alcoholism,,"I need to find a meeting in Columbus, Ohio Suffice it to say I need help. I broke down and weeped all over my neighborhood bar last night. Was walked home by another regular. Was told to get help.

Thereâ€™s a LOT more too it, but this was definitely a low. I have no friends outside the bar. I do nothing but go and â€œhang outâ€ just to not be alone.

Needless to say, I canâ€™t drive right now. I need to find a  meeting off of the number 2 or 102 bus line. Preferably near clintonvillle, if possible. I want a sponsor. I want to stop. Iâ€™m better than this, I know I am better than this."
alcoholism,,"I made it a week, and I feel great this morning! I know itâ€™s not much but it is for me. Itâ€™s amazing how good I feel this morning. Not a trace of anxiety."
alcoholism,,"Probably a stupid question, but if you drink more, and faster, does your body still process it at the same speed? Story short, I have a job that's BAC level is 0, I've always worked off 1 standard drink per hour, but if more was consumed over a short ammount of time, does the body process it faster?"
alcoholism,,"Advice for Pilot with Alcohol Use Disorder Friend of mine is a pilot with an alcohol use disorder. Doesnâ€™t drink on the job (according to him, of course, but I think heâ€™s being truthful), but he tends to go overboard when heâ€™s off the clock. A series of events in his personal life leads him to recognize his relationship with alcohol isnâ€™t healthy, so he seeks help. The therapist he goes to warns him that therapists are legally required to report substance abuse because of his profession, so he decides to deal with it on his own.

Question:
Is there any way for pilots to seek professional help without losing their job, or is he pretty much stuck with off-the-books, AA-type organizations for support? Disclaimer: I recognize the dangers of an impaired pilot, and my intention is not to enable him. But this is also a good friend of mine, and I want to try and help him find a way to keep his job and get healthy. I appreciate any insight you all might have.

alcoholism,,"I believe I have found myself in the clutches of the hootch and I am struggling to cut back. My introduction to drinking was a culture of work all day and then go out and party and get hammered at night. And then get up and do it again. Summer camp employee. This was back when I was about 17-18. It was just during the summer and was no big deal. But now, I am soon to be 25 and drink about a pint of vodka a night. I am what I think is called a high functioning alcoholic. I travel all over the country each week and usually work 50-60 hours a week. Yet I somehow manage to get plastered pretty much every night. Any tips on ways to cut back? It is starting to stunt my ability to grow but I struggle to not just swing into a liquor store before my hotel. I want to do something about this before it messes something up. Cheers!"
alcoholism,,Urges month into sobriety So after celebrating my one month yesterday I didnâ€™t expect this coming. I got home from work about an hour ago and was looking for something to eat before bed. While digging thru the freezer I found one of the last supreme pizzas that I hadnâ€™t ate from about a month ago. Backstory behind this is that I used to always come home from work and make one of those pizzas then binge drink until I found myself sloppy drunk. Not sure why but just seeing that pizza almost made me go pour one while preheating the oven. Iâ€™m trying to stay sober for real this time and it was incredibly hard to not drink even a month out.
alcoholism,,"Canâ€™t stop vomiting and numbness in hands and legs? Sorry, quick question.


My girlfriend is in Mexico for vacation and drank way too much yesterday. Now has probably vomited 4 times so far (the day after) and has told me sheâ€™ll feel numbness in her hands and legs. Please, does anyone know if this is serious enough for her to go to the hospital? Her parents keep saying sheâ€™ll get better but Iâ€™m getting worried"
alcoholism,,"Alcohol withdrawals/DTs UK I have been tapering off alcohol for 6 months now, with a couple of increases where I have got drunk. I'm down from 37 units to about 10 now and I have been in hospital twice from hallucinations, seizures ect. Then again for surgery where I needed benzos to stabilise me. 

All the hospital does is stabilises me and sends me on my way. Its financially impossible to afford alcohol to stop these bad withdrawals, which the Drs say I need to continue drinking.

 The other day I slashed my wrists and went to a bridge over a dual carigeway hoping to jump off as I'm so sick of this cycle. A family member got me before I did.

I want to stop but the hallucinations, jumpiness being so confused and the seizures are too much. I have woke up on the floor drool all over my mouth and have banged my head twice now. I can't keep food or water down. I have no money. 

I don't know what to do. Im in debt. I'm behind on bills. Is the bridge my only option. I want a inpatient detox but can't get one. I really want this to end. These withdrawals are too painful. 

My partner is fed up, and she doesnt understand these withdrawals, she keeps saying I'll be fine. I'm at my wits end and can't cope. The alcohol services are literally useless I've tried to get help. I might end up being forced to just end my life, I have exhausted all the help from the mental health team and gp and got nowhere. I've basically ruined my life at 25. I don't know what else to do."
alcoholism,,"Help?? Before I start, I just want to say that Iâ€™m really sorry if I offend anybody. I am just at my wits end and I need help.


My mum has had an alcohol problem for a long time, probably longer than I remember, or maybe I just didnâ€™t understand what alcoholism is and was blind and to young to acknowledge it.
I think the time it got worse was when my grandad (mums dad) died, however this was 6/7 years ago. I guess because Iâ€™m older now, I can really see the damage that itâ€™s causing to my mum and my family.

My mum lives in a bubble, where nothing bad happens in her world. Like, she wonâ€™t even acknowledge the stuff thatâ€™s happening in Iran/America or the fires in Australia. To put it into perspective, she didnâ€™t even know who Trump was until I told her. (We are in the U.K.) Because she literally refuses to accept anything that could slightly tilter her ideal perfect happy world. Except her perfect happy world isnâ€™t that at all, she struggles so bad with mental health problems but just wonâ€™t admit it and all of these problems and burying her head under the sand to life, have resorted to her drinking. Yet, she refuses to admit or accept any of it.

We have tried and tried to explain how we feel, we have tried interventions, we have tried to be supportive. She told me that in the new year she was going to â€œquitâ€ for 3 days a week. I told her that I want her to go and get help, not just â€œquit. Anyway, she lasted 2 days before she had to have a drink. Yet she continues to tell me that she â€œdoesnâ€™t have a problem because if she was an alcoholic then she couldnâ€™t get up to go to workâ€. 

I am at my wits end. I canâ€™t take this anymore because itâ€™s destroying me. I am receiving therapy for anxiety/Ed because of all of this.

I just needed to outlet everything. 
What do I do?"
alcoholism,,"Struggling today to stay sober during work... I've been sober so far this year and I am really struggling today. The week was easy until work got stressful. 

I am an introvert with massive anxiety (since childhood) and I am working from home this week with so many meetings. I can't stop thinking about getting some beer to help me calm my nerves from having to talk to people. I don't want to get drunk but I really just want a drink. I promised myself I would get through this but today is really hard. I keep thinking about how everyone always compliments me after meetings after I've had a drink vs being sober and awkward. I like not overthinking and alcohol seems to help. I know I shouldn't. Just really struggling today. 

Just venting."

alcoholism,,"2 days sober and I am freaking out So I've been drinking off and on for years.  I'm 63 years old and retired.  Up until the past year or so my pattern would be do whatever I had to do at home or with my job and then at 5:00 take a highball glass, filled to the brim with ice and add vodka.  I might head in the garage or yard and smoke a cigar.  This would be off and on over the years, and I'd drink until about 7 (maybe 4 or 5 in total).  There would be breaks in this habit, sometimes a month or more.

Last January my wife took a job in Germany (we live in the states) and was gone most of the year with the odd visit home.  By the time 5:00 rolled around I was bored out of my mind and for the past year, virtually without pause, would pour that first drink at 5 and continue with that habit.  Again, 4-6 ""drinks"" a night.  Most nights I went to bed not drunk but damn close.

I decided this needs to stop so a couple nights ago I dumped everything out and am determined to get my health back.  Last night (and this has happened in the past when I ""quit"" I had 3 or 4 terror dreams and I don't know if I was screaming or talking out loud but pretty sure I was.

Tonight, I am getting on a plane to fly 11 hours to the UK in business class and I'm freaking out that I'm going to have some hallucinatory dream and freak everyone else out.  I have access to my wife's prescription of lorazepam and was thinking of taking .05-1.0 mg to hopefully help me sleep and maybe calm things down.  Can anyone who may have had this experience help me out here?

Lastly, I have blood work scheduled with my dr when I get back and am pretty sure my liver enzymes are going to be crazy.  Hoping for the best."

alcoholism,,"One of those moments you realize what you've become I had one of those moments yesterday when I sat in the bathroom of the treatment facility I'm at, hunched over like a lunatic, squirting cheap ""Wonderwoman"" perfume I bought once at  dollarstore in a small glass because I felt like I had to drink but didn't have any other way to obtain alcohol.
It smelled. A lot. Like enough to give someone a migraine if they passed the bathroom. The smell followed me into my room and you absolutely didn't need to be Sherlock to figure out who it was. 
And today I am drinking hand sanitizer.

I don't want to. I really don't. I love being sober most of the time. It's like I can fight the urge most of the time, but then it hits me when I'm to tired or emotionally fragile to fight it and I give in. I am twenty years old. People say that I am bright. I am loved. I have a lot to live for. 
And I fucking drink hand sanitizer at lunch time."
alcoholism,,"The Day After the Hangover 55-year old male.  Been drinking since I was 21.  Generally, I drink one day a week (either Friday or Saturday).  I work hard and work out in the mornings during the week, so there's no desire or even temptation to drink during the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I go out on Saturdays, I'll go pretty hard.  Have 7 or 8 vodka-on-the-rocks.  When I get a healthy buzz, I'll go home.  Don't want to TOO drunk in public.  But no doubt I have a very nice buzz.  Friends have always told me I'm a happy drunk.  The next day (hangover day) isn't TOO bad.  I have the usual headache (that Tylenol can cure), lethargy, and fatigue.  But as a rule, nothing debilitating. I can function, I don't throw up.  If I'm alone with no external stimuli, I will sit on the couch, eat, and watch TV all day.  If I have something to do, I can generally do it.  Granted, there have been some days where the  hangover is really bad, but those are few and far between.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that over the past year, I'm completely exhausted and fatigued the day AFTER the hangover.  It's not a hangover anymore (at least in the conventional sense).  No headache, no dizzy feeling.  It's just utter fatigue.  I want to sleep all day, have no energy to do ANYTHING.  The fatigue is only upstairs, I'm SLEEEEEPY.  Body feels fine. I figured it would go away, but it hasn't, and now I'm tired of being tired on Day Two.

I turned 21 less than six months ago and my drinking pretty much spiraled out of control within a month of me being able to obtain alcohol by myself: and therefor easily conceal how much I was consuming. I simply wasnâ€™t born with the ability to moderately consume alcohol and that was made abundantly clear once my 21st rolled around. Well NOW I have been completely free of alcohol for six weeks!!!!

She's never been this way before. 

A little back story. She does take clonazepam for anxiety and when she runs out, she used to use alcohol in replace of it, withdraw, go to detox,  get better, etc. She's been there 6 times,  out of 6 months,  about 18 months ago. This time it's different. She's seems to be in psychosis or something. She hasn't had alcohol for the last 2 days for sure. In fact, yesterday her blood alcohol was 0. Which we found a liter of vodka we think she had the night before. 

Has anyone experienced someone this way before? We are nervous it may be permanent. 

Thank you!"
alcoholism,,"An interesting title This may get long but Iâ€™ll try to use correct grammaaar.

Iâ€™ve been on reddit now browsing the threads on alcoholism for months now but Iâ€™ve never posted. But itâ€™s gotten to the point where I need to reach out and gather opinions on my own personal situation. 

Writing this with shaky hands, recovering from a 4 day bender, Iâ€™m just sick of â€œbouncing backâ€ from these benders. Iâ€™ll have a GREAT 4 months and then out of nowhere go walk down the street and buy a handle of fireball and finish it in 3 days. Iâ€™ve had 5 seizures, experienced DTâ€™s an unhealthy amount of times, and hear and see things that arenâ€™t really after every bender. The WORST is hearing sounds/music that isnâ€™t even there. And itâ€™s vivid, as if I can hear the chords and vocals of a song that Iâ€™ve never even heard before and it just plays through my head. That, and then the sudden jolts of explosions I hear in my ears/head that stir me awake as Iâ€™m trying to fall asleep.

This is somewhat of a venting session so forgive me if it gets annoying, but Iâ€™d just like to hear what some of you have done to SUSTAIN sobriety and not just stick to these month long strains of it. I attend AA, have a decent sponsor, have family support, and seek help from multiple counselors on a weekly basis, but nothing seems to stick right.

Iâ€™m not even sure if this is the right area to be posting such information or if I should go over to a different area (still new to Reddit). But feel free to lay it on me if youâ€™d like because the youtube videos and advice from friends who have no idea what Iâ€™m going through, can only go so far.

Thanks ladies and gents"
alcoholism,,"I canâ€™t enjoy shows sober I had issues with alcohol in the past, but I began to moderate. Iâ€™ve done pretty well with moderation mentally (or so I thought) , physically Iâ€™ve struggling with the kindling effect and feeling WDs after a night of heavier than usual drinking. 

I guess it still has some mental hold because Iâ€™ve realized I canâ€™t enjoy shows as much sober. I know I used to be able to, I went to concerts long before I started drinking. And I always had a good time. 


I went to a sober venue last night for the first time, and I just didnâ€™t have much fun. I drank a bit before hand, but was sober by time the show started. The music was good, but I just couldnâ€™t jam like I usually do. I felt anxious and awkward without a drink in my hand, and resorted to chain smoking, which, I donâ€™t even like smoking sober. I just needed something. I couldnâ€™t hardly focus on the bands because my mind was either on how awkward I felt, how much I wanted a drink, OCD related obsessions, or how I felt guilty for being at a show instead of working (Iâ€™m an graphic designer and a workaholic and since I freelance i struggle to give myself time offâ€  


I feel guilty for not being able to enjoy the show sober, and Iâ€™m upset that I couldnâ€™t enjoy it. I didnâ€™t hate it or anything, I donâ€™t regret going, but itâ€™s the first time I was just having an â€œok timeâ€.  lm also upset that alcohol still clearly has a mental hold on me, I hate this. I donâ€™t want to quit though, which I know is dumb rationally.  But I donâ€™t go to shows super often at least..."
alcoholism,,"Starting an NHS Home Detox on Monday, anyone had previous experience of it? (UK) I've been off work for about 5 months after a nervous breakdown. 

Recognised alcohol was a huge part of that and that it was fighting against the antidepressants (Venlafaxine/Effexor) and asked for a detox. NHS has been amazing - referred from GP to Adult Mental Health Team in first place then referred to the local Addictions Team. Process took about 2 months (Christmas got in the way), and I had wanted to stop immediately, but get that they are busy.

5 day detox and I'll have a nurse round twice a day for the first 3 days, then once a day for the next 2. After that will be counselling and other stuff. All free of course, thanks to NHS.

I've been drinking constantly for about 25 years (41 years old), heavier over the last 10 years, and worse over the last two (lost my mum to cancer, lots of work pressure).

Probably average between 20 to 30 units a day. Can't remember last time I didn't have a drink.

Has anyone been through the same home detox and can give a bit of insight? It'll be librium for a few days and vitamin injections (pabrinex). Also been prescribed Thiamine in the meantime.

Just wondering how it's gone for others. I really want to stop, but it's a little scary :)"
alcoholism,,"Am I an alcoholic? I am a 25 year old male. I honestly never thought I was an alcoholic or anything as I can go extended periods of time without drinking. I may occasionally have a beer when chilling alone but donâ€™t feel the urge to have more after. I can even go periods of weeks without a drink. My issue is whenever I hang out with friends and have a drink I canâ€™t stop. I plan on having one or two and end up having 15 drinks. Every time I drink socially I end up hammered. I keep my composure very well, and never seem shitfaced. Most people say I didnâ€™t seem that drunk the next day even after 15 drinks in, knowing I was pretty fucked up. I can and have gone up to 3-4 weeks without one drink. But once I have one drink socially I get absolutely fucked, then start doing it more often. I was off work for holidays for 2.5 weeks, and would say I drank around 14 of the 18 days as I was hanging with a lot of friends, and every time was with friends I got absolutely shitfaced (probs had 150-200 drinks over those couple weeks). I came back home from the holidays and said Iâ€™m done binge drinking for a month as my body felt like it was shutting down. After getting home (different town then where I was for holidays), my buddy I hadnâ€™t seen in a while invited me out tonight and I thought why not. I told him Iâ€™d have a couple drinks max as I need to work tomoro to catch up on stuff. I ended up drinking 15+ drinks, ended up at the casino to keep the night going, and am now at home awake past 6am. Itâ€™s almost like I lose control after the first couple drinks and canâ€™t stop, and it only happens when with other people. I can control it when alone but when with others I canâ€™t stop. When out with others, I always tell myself I will only have a couple drinks then have at least 10. It is especially an issue at work events as I work in finance and people drink often. Whenever we go out for a social event I try to limit myself to a few drinks as donâ€™t want to do anything embarrassing around work colleagues and end up having like 10-15 drinks every time. Is this alcoholism? How can I stop this? Most my friends drink and when we hang out I almost always drink excessively."
alcoholism,,"How does alcohol affect your brain. I'm just asking because I feel like every Internet article tells you something different. It's also that everybody talks about the liver all the time but not really about your brain.
So after a lot of consumed alcohol, do your braincells really die and you can't get back your lost intelligence? Or are it just your synapses that get damaged and they can grow back if you use your brain often and think a lot?
I know it sounds like an odd question but I'm really curious."
alcoholism,,"I canâ€™t stop... please help Canâ€™t stop. Drinking for PTSD, but I know the withdrawals make the anxiety worse. Iâ€™m terrified when I donâ€™t have a drink. Not drinking excessively anymore, was drinking an entire fifth of Wild Turkey 101 EVERY morning. Kicked that. Drinking a half an airplane shot in the morning now, and a few beers in the evening. Body canâ€™t handle it, mind canâ€™t handle it, canâ€™t stop. Huge weight gain because of it. Heart palpitations too. Single father of 4, full time. 2 special needs kids. Stress is at maximum. Now, Iâ€™m very very happy with my life, and my children. The problem is the drink. I canâ€™t seem to kick it. Canâ€™t find any other way to dull the anxiety.

alcoholism,,"Spouse Heading to Treatment So after 10 years of severe drinking, my husband will head to treatment on Monday. After a particularly rough binge over the Christmas holidays, itâ€™s all came to a head that resulted in outside family members getting involved, and him being removed from our home. He has been a heavy drinking for many years, but the past few years have gotten quite bad. He hides alcohol, drinks first thing in the morning, into the night, gets belligerent, blacks out and canâ€™t even put two words together most times. If heâ€™s not at work, heâ€™s drunk. So as of Monday, he heads out of province for a 5 week treatment program. I guess Iâ€™m looking for advice of how to deal with his absence? Maybe looking for others to share their experiences of their spouses heading away for treatment? Iâ€™m not sure exactly why Iâ€™m looking for, but I figured this post could prompt a discussion to help me reconcile some of my feelings, or help tease out some coping mechanisms."

I only drink straight vodka. Today I experienced withdrawals for the first time because i did not drink at all last night.

alcoholism,,"Husband in detox Hi, 

My husband is in detox at the hospital right now. I didnâ€™t know how much he was drinking/ how bad it had gotten. Apparently heâ€™s drinking a liter of vodka daily. We were supposed to be on our way to Morocco right now, but instead he is in the hospital because the alcohol did something to irritate his stomach and he was vomiting blood. They did some tests and his liver is angry but should recover.

I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing all this. I feel stupid for not knowing how bad it is, Iâ€™m upset we had to cancel our vacation, Iâ€™m worried because it seems like heâ€™s not feeling well at all (understatement of the year), and im worried about what happens when he gets home. 

I think I just needed to vent and I thought this group might understand. 

Thanks for reading."
alcoholism,,"Is there anything I should know about a serious caffeine binge? Recovering alcoholic here, almost a decade of sobriety. I also have over a year of sobriety to caffeine due to fairly serious medical complications with caffeine (it heightens my social anxiety and screws up my urinary system where I pee almost constantly). Of course I could drink one coffee in the morning and thatâ€™d be good for me, but I lack the ability to do anything that makes me feel good in moderation because thatâ€™s how I am.
Â 
I fell off the caffeine wagon last week, but in my way of justifying things this is a short-term addiction that Iâ€™m doing because I got a rare two weeks off work.
Â 
I am 100% capable of quitting caffeine intake again and this will not be a problem in the future.

My question is, since Iâ€™m pounding diet soda and some energy drinks like I used to with alcohol and will probably finish a 24 back of soda today, is there something I need to worry about? Iâ€™m not worried about long-term; Iâ€™ve got that one. I know what I can do. But I want to be positive me being me for a day with soda wonâ€™t hurt me.

alcoholism,,"Needing advice from those who have gotten sober I'm going to try and keep this brief, even though things always are complicated. My Aunt is an alcoholic and has been for 24 years. She is like a mother to me. Some very basic background is my family is VERY involved in one another's lives and I don't think their methods of support have been ideal, but as someone who has never faced addiction or rehab, I would like to know the thought's of those who have been through it and can see this situation more clearly. After 24 years, my aunt transitioned from a functioning alcoholic to a non-functioning alcoholic. She was content with her drinking problem until this happened, and was very self-aware about it. She called me and told me she intended to stop drinking, and on the first of the year (Jan 1st, 2020) would start attending AA daily. This was her own decision, as my family stopped trying to convince her to do anything a very long time ago. They even drank with her on holidays and at dinners. She attempted to quit New Year's Eve and decided to not go out. 

She was immediately sick, had horrible cravings, and called my (actual) mother. My aunt said she didn't think she could get through detox alone and that she felt horrible and wanted to go to rehab. They couldn't get her in anywhere that night but found one for the following day (new year day.) She called me and told me she wanted to go in for the Detox process, which she thought might last around 5-7 days. She did. On the 7th day, my mom and another aunt (lets call her P) visited her and she wanted to leave. P and my mom made the decision to rush out and leave her there without telling her they were leaving. Since then, my entire family has been trying to make decisions for my aunt. My grandfather, whom they are all very incredibly close with and see weekly, decided she should stay 28-90 days and should have no contact with her, and P agreed. 

They think isolating her and not seeing her will make it easier for her to want to stay in rehab. Meanwhile, I told my mom I disagreed and that my aunt would need support. Today, my mom visited again and my aunt has been there for two weeks exactly. My aunt had her bags packed and expressed to my mom that she wanted to go home, and that she never signed up to stay for 28 days, that she just wanted to come in on her own accord to detox. She explains that she wants to stay with my mom, go to AA meetings daily, and get on a new routine. My mom called me in a panic and asked what she should do when my aunt asked her to take her home (to my mom's house,) she's now concerned that visiting her did make her want to leave. I told my mom to talk to her, and try to see if my aunt thought staying in rehab would be in her best interest, and if my aunt didn't agree, then I thought it would be better to take her home. 

The reason I think this is because my aunt can check herself out on her own at any time, and has not. She can call a cab and do whatever she likes. What I don't want is for her to feel alone, and abandoned, and do something like leave and go to a bar, or even just feel she has nowhere to go at all. My mom went in and spoke to her, and my mom needed to rush to a job interview directly after and told my aunt she wouldn't have time to take her home today anyway and to stay for one more night. So my question now is what does anyone on this forum think about this situation? My mom is dependant on me for answers on this, and the rest of my family seems forceful about just this one option of rehab. If she left early she would not have support from them, and I do think they would make her feel worse, which would ruin the transparency my aunt has been trying to have with them. 

My aunt expects to hear from my mom tomorrow, and I truly don't know what to do. At this point, I think my mom should pick her up tomorrow morning and help her find local meetings, take her to them daily, and have my aunt get a counselor outside of rehab that can help her with short-term and long-term goals. I think my mom should establish a level of openness with my aunt so that if my aunt ever does feel overwhelmed by her triggers, she can tell my mom that she may need actual time in rehab outside of detoxing. I just don't think attempting to force her to stay there will result in her truly learning anything. But I could be wrong. PS my family lives on the East Coast and I live on the West Coast. That's why this has been something my mom has had to do on her own. If I was there I would absolutely be the one handling all of this. My aunt and I's connection is incredibly deep, and I'm the one she calls when she needs to vent, get advice, etc. If anyone has any advice at all on my current thoughts, please let me know. Thank you!"
alcoholism,,"Need Some Advice I probably know the answer already but I guess I wanted to talk about it.

Iâ€™m in my mid 30s, married, no kids, good job, good family. Iâ€™ve battled some addictions in the past but was able to pull through ultimately (pain meds in my late teens early twenties). I drank occasionally through the years but never anything major. A few years ago i fell in love with craft beer. Itâ€™s a fun hobby-beer releases, various kinds of beers for your palate, fun community etc. However the last year or so it has escalated. I used to only drink on the weekends and have a couple of beers. This has slowly inched its way into the work week. Iâ€™ve also noticed my anxiety has been substantially worse the last few months which in this fucked up way ends up increasing my drinking. Over the course of December with the holidays and a recent family trip I drank for almost a month straight with only a few days off. I havenâ€™t drank in two days and am just feeling super fucking lethargic, down, depressed. I know that this is a hard come down-but also am I awaking to the reality that Iâ€™m an alcoholic?  Guess Iâ€™m just not sure how to approach this.  Ultimately I know itâ€™s not good for me. But am I just in the place where I need to cut back substantially or just swear it off forever?"

I hate this insanity.  I badly want to be sober, but I keep failing!! Any advice??

alcoholism,,"Is a ""functional alcoholic"" still bad as a ""alcoholic""? Er so I know a bit of what happen but not the full story...

Christmas eve, my grandma asked my sister about my moms bf (they been together for 3yrs, first time he came for Christmas). So my sister was honest.. she told her that hes a alcoholic. Which is true, that's the only thing he drinks (except at work, where he drinks water). He goes through two 24pks in a weekend. Every weekend he drinks so much to the point he is drunk (can't walk in a straight line, slurring his words, etc). 

Well... Christmas day he proposed to her. Everyone did agree that they had ""mixed feelings"" about this (my mom does not know about this). 

Fast forward to yesterday.. we went with my mom to a wedding expo and she was all happy (honestly, I started to feel bad that I also had ""mixed feelings""). So today my mom came in and yelled at my sister and I (even thought I wasn't part of this) :

Mom said ""you want to tell my mom that hes an alcoholic and be in my business"" 

Sister said ""well he is"" 

Mom said ""no hes not, hes a ""functional"" one and when you want to stop telling people about my business, especially your father (no idea why that's a problem, we never told her we talk to him about it and my dad is a good listener/ advice giver so we talk to him about problems) you can go look for an apartment and move out"" (her threat everytime).

So my mom probably told her mom where she went yesterday and my grandma probably brought what my sister said up.

Sooo I know the difference. But aren't they the same, in terms of a ""alcoholic""? Isn't just as bad? (I really hope that makes sense, I'm having a hard time putting into a question)

** I want to add that my sister, brother and I don't like him very much as he does have an attitude problem and threats to punch my brother (hes 12). Literally last night he said ""wait tell your 16 and I will punch you"". And other stuff to but isn't related to the topic (well it is but..)

Iâ€™m not sure what is the best subreddit to post this in and if it is triggering at all please let me know and Iâ€™ll delete it. I admire yâ€™alls strength in finding sobriety and it gives me hope for my fiancÃ© when I thought hope was useless. I (23f) have been with my fiancÃ© (40m) for 3 years, engaged for 1. Our wedding is 1.5 months away and I am starting to panic. We have gone through so many ups and down with his awful binge weeks and somewhat normal sober weeks. I know you canâ€™t make someone want to be sober but I really donâ€™t know what his breaking point will be. He has had loved ones die from drunk drivers, a dui that he feared would cost him his job, countless relationships ended over alcohol, and I think he knows Iâ€™m hanging on by a thread, yet he continues to chose alcohol. I try not to take it personally because I know itâ€™s an addiction and that makes his way of thinking totally warped, but itâ€™s hard not to when he is completely emotionally abusive when he is drinking. From what I have heard from family he has had a problem with alcohol since college. Obviously with our age gap, he was my first â€œadultâ€ relationship and because he is older I thought this is just how much adults drink until I realized it was everyday he was completely wasted even before I would come over, and when I was there he would always try to get me wasted as well. He is unable To have a single drink without getting carried away and unable to drink without becoming completely aggressive and argumentative with anyone he talks to. No matter how ridiculous it is, he will find something to argue about and try to blame everything on you. He has tried aa, counseling, antibuse(have they quit making this?), but of course he didnâ€™t take it seriously because he wasnâ€™t ready. The longest I have seen him sober was one month and when he relapsed, around his 5th binge, he was saying he needed to get help and complaining that he is going to have to go back to his sober app and start it all over, as if he believed he was technically sober during those binges? Iâ€™m afraid he will never be sober and our marriage will end if it even has a chance to begin. I donâ€™t know what to do or say. What made you realize you need to quit drinking? I donâ€™t think he will ever get there but somehow I still canâ€™t help but hope...  I guess I am mostly ranting but I also would like any advice/insight on this. Thanks"
alcoholism,,"Crazy one year clean story Today marks a huge achievement &amp; accomplishment in my life!  
I never ever, in my life, found it so important until about 9 months ago. It made a big impact on my life.  
Some know &amp; some don't, that I am an alcoholic.  I have known that I have loved booze for a really long time.  
The term alcoholism or alcoholic was to me, a different world, something I was not. I have always payed my bills and that made everything ok. But I was fucken wrong.  Alcohol is destructive.  Alcohol is a fun little enemy.   It can be your friend, it can help you have fun in bad times and it can help you believe you are a people person. Believe me I used alcohol to get everything I could out of it!  Alcohol also changes who you are as a person.   It rearranges how you think and slowly I lost who I was and I hope to never be that person again! 
Now letâ€™s think about that. In the beginning stages of the alcoholic mode, I lost Zachary Livingston the kid &amp; person I was before drinking and then slowly became a drunk ""Zack.""  It didn't happen over night, it was slowly &amp; progressively changing me and I had little to no idea it was happening except I knew in the back of my mind and it was like I was liking the crazy and I wanted to push it and see how crazy it could get and still be ok and I did!  I pushed hard for years and years and my life became unmanagable, probably like some crazy movie with stupid twists, lows,  ups &amp; downs.  In the process I was slowly loosing my abilities to feel and express true emotions and by the end, it was a world of FEAR that I lived in!   FEAR all the time!  Fear of loosing everything, fear of withdrawals, fear of feelings, fear of driving, fear of being in public, fear of going anywhere, fear of dying, and the small amounts of sober I had, hurt so bad.  I definitely felt depressed and confused.  I knew booze was bad, I knew I needed to stop, but there was no fucken way I was gonna do it.  All the ""Horrible stuff"" stopped completely within the first half of the first drink! I found it crazy.  I believed ""I"" was crazy!  I had come to terms that booze was going to kill me and there was nothing I could do to stop it!  I became comfortable with that and lived like that for a long time. By this time I had children and just to think about them and how I was teaching them to be people, when I knew in my mind, booze was going to take me out because I was unable to be sober &amp; feel!  It was completely crazy!  I tried and tried to be sober and failed and failed and tried and failed again but kept trying! I look at it like the world had the tools for me to use to find sobriety, I just needed to not only find the tools but use them in the right order like a kind of puzzle to freedom! 
Then by some miracle it happened!!!  I was trying to stop drinking so I put an interlock in my car so at least I would not drive drunk. But fuck that!  Drunk Zack was smart too.  He got that bitch to start and he was off, on his way home to sleep the drunk away!  He didn't make it.   The police woke him up.  He was sleeping in his car at a red light!  Yep I was busted with a 40oz in my lap half empty and many empty ones through out the car.  I was out of jail the next morning and I lost myself!!! 100% full fledge self destruction!  3 days later I was served divorce papers.  2 weeks after that, I was staying with someone that drank more then I did. 
 I was charged with a DUI &amp; I was assigned a caseworker and was put on U/As.  I hadnâ€™t been in trouble, for over 10 years I think, and at that time they could only test for alcohol within 24 hrs!  Science had discovered a way to test for 5 fucken days now and..... Bam! Bam! Bam!!   Dirty!  Dirty! and Dirty!!  My caseworker told me to try to medically detox.  I tried but that was a joke.  Lol!   I was drunk the next day after detox.  My caseworker suggested that I try to get a red card.  I was shocked!  I didnâ€™t really smoke pot because it super fucked me up when I was drinking.  Dirty after dirty U/As kept happening.  One day I went to court and didnâ€™t have too  many dirty U/As but was told, people were concerned for the safety of the public, as during this time I was found sleeping drunk in my car by the police and told to get a cab out of there.  When I went to court, I was sent to jail that day!   Get this, they have an under ground tunnel to the jail from the courthouse!   It was crazy.  They released me the next morning.  I drove straight to the booze shop and got two 40s and immediately drank them to stop the shivers and sweating and not 5 minutes later my caseworker called and said I had till 5pm to go to this place where they were going to strap this thing to my ankle and it would sniff me every 20 minutes to see if I drank! Wow!   Science is crazy!  I went to get my red card that same day as maybe a back up plan.  I really didnâ€™t know if I was going to even try to stop drinking.  I got to the place 10 minutes before they closed and strapped up my leg. That evening I went home to a super drunk friend.  It was one week till Christmas and I knew in my heart that I needed to be around for Christmas &amp; not in jail or missing or something. My kids needed me to be around for Christmas! 
That was ONE YEAR AGO! 
 I donâ€™t know if you know but the first day without alcohol isnt that bad but by day 3,  Holy Fuck!!!  I tried to cover it with a lot of THC edibles.  It helped a lot, but rendered me very useless.  I was still staying with that drunk person.  On day one, we were on the same level and every day that went by I felt different and they stayed the same, stuck where I was,  just a few days before. By the time Christmas hit I was a full fledged wreck.  Thats when I found out, I forgot how to feel feelings.  It was like getting hit by a train right after being beaten with a shovel! Shaking, sweating, cold, confused full of anxiety and super scared!  But a real scared!  A different fear from the fear I had when I was drinking! I realized that this scared feeling I felt was REAL &amp; was not caused by alcohol. I sat there that night and thought, maybe I could make it till New Years, not drinking and then I will drink and go back to my path of destruction. A few days later, the person I was staying with moved thousands of miles away and was still stuck right where I was on December 19th . Iâ€™m glad I saw them every day during my first part of detoxification to look at and see what I was and see the sickness of alcoholism in its pure raw form as my mind started to clear itself of alcohol.  New Years came and I spent alot of  time with my children, started to figure out where I was going to live &amp; kept working.  I smoked some pot to calm panic attacks. (I started getting panic attacks a few years ago every time I tryed to stop drinking.)  I made a commitment to get an apartment with a old friend and worked out my budget. Well look at that!   Sober me was making plans and goals now!!! And you know what?  They started to work out!  My divorce was finalized,  plans were made that worked out for everyone! 
I started to identify new feelings on a daily basis. I remember looking at a calendar and was so surprised I hadn't drank for 90 days!  Wow!  I looked on Facebook, of all places.  I looked at it and was... ok this is the moment!  This is it!  Iâ€™m going to be sober!  Iâ€™m really going to work for this and I knew I could do this!  
From that day forward, I have built a super strong support system.   I only keep the best people in my life! I also set lots of goals.  I have hour long goals,  day long goals,  week long goals, year long goals and even decade goals and Iâ€™m making them happen too!   Crazy right?  
I lost my drivers license and had to go to jail for 30 days.  6 months of not drinking only to get to go to jail &amp; then work release!  I had to put a breathelizer in my car &amp; got my drivers license back.   I started alcohol treatment/therapy &amp; I make sure I get my moneys worth, every time I go.  I make them follow their plans.  I lost my shit on them when they didnâ€™t let me finish an activity and demanded a refund and now they make sure I get my time and make use of all the material they provide.  They don't skip anything.  Not with me!  Fuckers, I pay for treatment,  you provide it! 
That brings us to today.   December 19th 2019 my one year sobriety date!!  
Looking back on this last year, I feel I have grown more than any of my 20 years as an adult. I feel FREE!  I have newly found feelings &amp; understanding  for people that suffer from addiction and their potential to feel what I feel &amp; felt.  I have hope they look for the tools that work for them because I could never buy this feeling or be given it!   Iâ€™m so happy I found it &amp; Iâ€™m so excited to see what 2020 has to offer me &amp; other addicts that also want to be free.

alcoholism,,"The drink has been negatively effecting my life for 28 years.. yet I don't stop. Most all of the problems in my life stem from alcohol abuse. Daily anxiety, dehydration, constipation, an unending hangover... I'm unable to be present in any moment, I'm dizzy most of the day, constantly feeling guilty for the previous night's debauchery, and always tired because I never get a good night's sleep.

Wife, job, respect have all been lost due to me not being sober. Why don't I stop?

It's tough writing all of this down. I'm just wondering if this page can be a safe place to get some support. It's taken me a few years to post this.

Just want to thank this page for existing."

Obviously replacing one addiction with another is not good but he needs something. Anyone have experience with this ?"
alcoholism,,"Recently stopped/cut back on drinking. Having terrible anxiety. After about two years of heavy drinking I finally decided to quit. I have always had bad anxiety but now it is unbearable. I moved to nyc for a year and I started to drink a lot more. About a p in nt of vodka every night. The last month I was in NYC I was drinking a lot more, about 20 drinks a night, a few nights a week. I would black out frequently and sometimes wake up outside. One day I woke up after getting black out drunk and everything was terrifying to me. J didnt leave my house for several days, and when I tried going back to work I would have panic attacks on my way to work and at work. After several days of trying to get back to normal, I realized I couldn't. I stayed at home for 2 days and drank about 4 liters of vodka. I didnt want to be awake. It's been almost two months since then, and I moved back into my mother's house in Tampa, fl. I worked for a few weeks waiting for my to my anxiety to subside, but it hasn't. Sometimes I have good days, but for the most part I still feel a little terrified. I haven't had a panic attack since I left New York, but I just can't seem to calm down. I hate driving, being outside, being at work, or doing anything. Even laying in bed in my room isn't comforting most of the time.i only feel normal when I have a few drinks in me. I've cut back a lot, but the days I dont drink I feel like shit. I don't have health insurance or money to see a psychiatrist.  I did pay to get a blood test a month ago, and found my vitamin d to be very low and my liver enzymes very high. I've been taking vitamin d pills and other vitamins to help with anxiety but nothing is really helping. I started excersing yesterday as well but it did not really help. My future feels really bleak, and sometimes I think about killing myself. Reality just seems like a sick joke as of recently and I cant take it. 
Has anyone else felt like this when trying to quit drinking?"
alcoholism,,"Daughter of one alcoholic, maybe two I ask you to be brutally honest with me because I'm in a situation where I don't know what's right and wrong anymore.   


To give some context I'm 24F and have always known my father to be an aggressive alcoholic.  I was lucky to enough to have a mum that took me out of that situation when I was six and they got a divorce. I sadly at that age did witness them fighting regularly with one night resulting in my mum getting beaten up so badly that her face became unrecognisible and bizarrely my six year old mind used to blame myself for what was happening. Not long after the divorce my father got remarried and as my mum still wanted me to have a father figure in my life, I would occasionally visit them. My father's aggression would fluctuate depending on the day but his alcohol intake was always consistent. During those years I have witnessed a lot of things that I have only this summer been able to leave in the past with therapy.   
However this post isn't about my father, it's about my mum.   
She has always liked the occasional beer after work but it has now turned into 4-5 a night with the occasional sober day in between so nowhere near as much as my father (I don't know what else to compare it to) but definitely more than 'normal'?   
I've tried talking to her, she hasn't taken me seriously but eventually accepted that maybe she does drink too much and it's mainly because of boredom. She doesn't become aggressive, she becomes happier. So it's really difficult to distinguish if this is an actual problem.   
We spoke about the quantity of her drinking and she agreed that she needed to cut down but didn't and has continued to drink since these conversations. This is when I got very angry and said a lot of things which I shouldn't have said, calling her irresponsible and comparing her to my dad and a plethora of other things to which she replied I was making it all about myself.   


I realised I don't have the knowhow of dealing with yet again another parent with alcohol issues, I have no tolerance towards it which is very unfair on my mum. I'm not taking it very well at all, I've been in bed for the past three days only to have her come into my room this evening to tell me she was going to the shop and for me not to get mad at her for buying more beers. Even typing this out is making me realise just how problematic this is and I just can't believe I never saw this happening right under my own eyes.   


I have a thousand things going through my mind. What's going to happen to her health? Is it going to get worse when I leave home? Should I leave home? How do I help her? Have I made it worse? Am I the reason?   


Anyway, this is all a bit of a shitshow isn't it? Any advice would be appreciated and apologies if this is the wrong place to post this.   
I'd also liked to add that if you are someone dealing with alcohol issues, carry on fighting through them because it's absolutely worth getting your sobriety back.   
I don't understand why such a toxic substance is legal. Take my story as an example of many which could have panned out very differently had alcohol not been a part of it. 

  
tl;dr: Father's always been an alcoholic and now I may have an alcoholic mother too."
alcoholism,,Why am i such a dick Within the past few months i havent been able to stop drinking until i pass out which in itself is a problem but the more immediate problem is how i act. I dont get aggressive or confrontational i just start being plain cold mean. Me and my girlfriend rn are on a break up phase because i brought up random shit as to why i dont like her but shes everything to me and i dont mean the things im saying. up until i blacked out was one of the greatest nights ive had with her laughing catching up and talking about the future that im pretty sure as of this morning wont happen. I just dont know why i cant continue acting as normal or even half pick up on when im drinking too much. I pick out any minor problem and act like its a big deal despite her giving me the world. Does anyone else have this or know someome who does can anyone give me advice or things they've tried to slow down or get your head straight again
alcoholism,,"Question about Alcoholism I was in a very long term relationship, like about a decade long. Gradually over time, I realized my ex was a super control freak about a lot of insane things. In the last 3 years or so, he started controlling my drinking. I'm that person that quiet shy person sober but when drinking I just get happy. If I get behind I find a nice comfy spot and just go to sleep. I've never blacked out, I don't drink heavy when in public (bars and clubs, etc..). I'm super anxious about being too drunk when I do drink, plus I at some point filter in with ice water because I'm aware of the dehydration it causes and I start just craving water. 

So my ex suddenly started fighting with me while out drinking at friends houses. So much so, friends and family were literally sneaking me away to give me a shot or whatever. 

I feel like his control freak propelled me into a rebellion like a teenager does with their parents. Once I left, I was free to drink whenever I wanted. I don't think about it during sober days, I may have a few beers on occasion like every couple of weekends, when my kids aren't around. If it's offered and circumstance works out then I might have a few depending on where I am. 

For New year's I had a few beers with my dad, we (my kids and I) spent the week with him. I literally had 3 beers and then cooked dinner and finished off the night with lemonade that I made with my son. 

Now I have my ex telling me because I drink so much , ""I better get my shit straight, or else"". I'm pretty sure he's questioning our daughter when she goes to see him on the weekends. 

But am I just mentally warped because of him? I don't think I'm an alcoholic. Its not something I need.  I don't binge. I'm not ridiculous when I drink. Idk.. I'm at the point of just not drinking around the kids, ever, at all. To prevent them from having to report back, but it's frustrating that I'm being made to feel like I'm a problem when anyone else I drink with says  I'm fine not even annoying."
alcoholism,,"Why do I keep passing my limits? Hi. 28 male here. 
So for the last 12 years I've been partying a lot like most of my friends. Usually I would be drinking every saturday. Three years ago I met my current girlfriend(26) and she wasn't much of a party goer compared to me. Since I've met her there's been these episodes were I go out and get really drunk and come home being all paranoid and delusional. I don't recall any of these situations. 

My girlfriend tells me that I'm saying things like ""I'm going to kill anyone who brakes in our house"", ""she should brake up with me for being a drunk"" ""I'm never going to give up partying"" etc.. There's also been episodes were I've shat on the floor only to find it the next morning, with a headic and no recollection of it all.

After previous episodes with this I've tried to stop drinking to much when I go out. It usually works for a couple of months and than I forget and it's the same all over again. I don't understand why I keep drinking and don't  realise that I've had enough.  Whats wrong with me?"
alcoholism,,"Very little withdrawals... Anyone else? Long story short, I'm 29yo Male and had my first beer at 14... drank whenever I could in my teens and haven't gone more than a week with out a drink since 21... currently it's not hard for me to finish a 750 of jack per day and more on the weekends...

Crazy thing is, I'm four days sober with out a single withdrawal besides a little cloudiness, mild hand shakes and hard time sleeping with odd dreams... and it's getting better every day... I actually slept through the night last night feeling decent when I work up

alcoholism,,"Anxiety battling my sobriety  

Hi friends.

I'd like to stop drinking, and I think I have what it takes to do so. My issue is that since I've been regularly drinking 4-6+ beers nightly, on days that I decide not to, I'm hit with panic and anxiety.

It only really happens at night, as that's when I would typically drink. Rarely if ever (maybe a weekend game or something) do I drink before the evening. My anxiety manifests itself via ""ooh I'm having a heart attack"" and I think I'm dying. I succumb and drink a few beers to make that go away, but it's always the urge to have that panic stop, more so than ""god I'd really like a beer right now"".

I need to learn how or what to replace alcohol in this equation. I think I'm mentally tough enough but a few reads on here have me concerned for my safety. I don't thiiiiiink I'd have serious withdrawals aside from extreme boredom, but is that possible with my usage?

If the responses (which I very much appreciate) are that I should see a doctor, can someone please outline what exactly that would entail? I just want to know that when the panic sets in, that I'm actually safe and can just hunker down and endure until it passes.

On that note, how long does that take to go away if anybody here has had similar experiences? I know there's a lot of questions in this post but I appreciate anybody taking the time to help me out. 25 y/o male if that is relevant.

Thanks :)"
alcoholism,,"Day numero 10, and it's feeling good. Obviously ups and downs occur, but it's amazing how much better I am today that I was after just getting out of hospital, after the horrendous hallucinations and DT.

alcoholism,,"Oh man I can't do this... I think I'm at full blown alcoholism now I've been drinking for a few years off and on. Usually binge drinking. 

I dunno. I've been getting blackout drunk where I act schizophrenic. I'm scared it's DT but it's only when I'm blackout drunk. The last thing I remember is Friday.  Fuck. I'm getting heart palpitations, I feel like I've caused at least a bit of brain damage. My memory is getting worse. I just can't handle how sad and depressed I am when I'm not drunk. 

The scary thing is that this weekend, even though I was close to being blackout drunk, I was acting totally normal. No word slurring or anything. I could carry a conversation like normal. It's like I need alcohol to even function now. When I'm sober I don't even want to leave my bed, whereas when I drink I want to go out and do hobbies and such.. 

I'm gonna end up killing myself from this."
alcoholism,,I know how to do it but how. How do you go from a gallon of vodka every day or two to sober without missing work. If I had a week of free time I could see but damn whereâ€™s the time to ween off
alcoholism,,"Blacking out I've been a weekend drinker consistently since around 2011. I've gotten prettAy wrecked many, many, many times over that stretch. For a good amount of time, I'd get drunk but generally remembered how things went the night before, even if it was spotty. A few years ago, I experienced my first blackout state. I remember texting a friend and then waking up hours later in my room with no recollection of what happened after that text. 

It was a one time thing, though, and I didn't really blackout again for a couple more years. The next time was in 2015.

After that, again, it proved another one off deal and stayed this way for a few more years. But now, this past year, it's becoming more and more frequent. This past Friday, I got drunk with some friends, and got into a fight. I don't really remember anything about it. The last memory I have is walking outside but apparently, we drank well after that. I took a Lyft home and don't remember that at all. In fact, the last few weeks, I've blacked out three of the four times I drank somewhat heavily. A few weeks ago, I even smacked my head out in a playground we were playing around in drunk and I don't recall any of it, nor taking my Lyft home. 

I don't think I'm drinking any more than I was a year ago but it's just becoming way more common to get blackout drunk. Is there a reason for this? Is my tolerance just not as high as it used to be? I'm scared I'm doing irreversible damage. It's just so odd that I never had this problem but now I'm having it almost every time I drink."

Iâ€™ve been trying to quit for a while now. Longest was 5 years but recently the longest is 6 days. I flubbed up &amp; now am on day 3 again. Since I donâ€™t bounce back like I used to, and I have people who depend on me (for a change), I need this to stick."
alcoholism,,"I almost died at my birthday party Iâ€™ve been an alcoholic since I was 18. Today I turned 22. Iâ€™ve struggled so much over the past few years with drinking, and over the past year I really have been doing great. Iâ€™m not sober, I never will be, but Iâ€™ve gotten to a place in my daily life where alcohol (mostly) doesnâ€™t control me anymore. 

But on my birthday I lost it and my BAC was around a .3, probably a little higher. I canâ€™t and wonâ€™t go into detail about what happened that night, but yâ€™all know what happens when you drink that much, and if my fiancÃ© wasnâ€™t there I know that I would have died. I think that this was a huge wake up call that I canâ€™t let myself get bad again, because now I have so much to look forward to, and I almost threw it all away for some drinks. I just feel stupid right now. And mortified, remorseful, thankful, scared... just so many emotions that I canâ€™t even begin to process."

Iâ€™m also suicidal, so anything that will kill me is almost welcome. Why do people decide to stop drinking? The fact that I donâ€™t know probably boggles many of you.

alcoholism,,"How to approach alcoholic mother Long story short. My father passed nearly 2 years ago and since then my mother has been diving further into alcoholism. She always drank but never this much. We offered help but lied about taking it and eventually she took help when she started dating a new man. This was all relatively recently in December and we had a different Christmas but a sober one. My mother took help from a local rehab centre and we figured we were in the clear. She was clear and so thankful. I had no idea it was that bad but the withdrawal was definitely real and I did not know about the seizures or shaking.

Fast forward to my son's first birthday this weekend. My mom asks me for a glass of wine as if it were nothing. I questioned if she should be drinking and she assured me she can have a little. I refused. From speaking to friends and family I found out she had been drinking again and I've been lied to repeatedly. I know she secretly had the goal of becoming a ""casual drinker"" again. I've never really seen her as an addict until then. 

My wife will be returning to work in a few weeks and my mom was supposed to watch my son a few days of the week. I now know I cannot trust her not to drink or safely take care of my son and I need to say this to her. She was having shakes and drinking 24/7 to stop them. I feel ashamed even writing that she was supposed to watch my son. 

How do I have this conversation? I feel like this is going to cause a large fight within our family but know it needs to happen for my sons safety. Words can barely describe my disappointment. Is it better to talk to a professional? Hire an interventionist? Or just explain my feelings myself? 

Thanks for reading. Always felt very supported by the community."

I tend to keep my drinking private, I live in my parents pool house and thatâ€™s where the majority of the consumption occurs. Last night my mom checked up on me because I wasnâ€™t responding to my texts, to her surprise I was passed out in bed, place covered with beer cans. She was very disappointed, and I immediately started to cry. Iâ€™m so ashamed of myself and I donâ€™t know what else to do. I keep letting myself go down this road, I want nothing more than to just be normal, I want to be able to watch the game and have a couple beers. Iâ€™m starting to realize that I can never be like that. Itâ€™s just hard accepting the fact. Iâ€™ll be sober for maybe a month and then I convince myself that I can drink like a normal person.

I live in a rural area surrounded by friends and family who routinely drink 8+ drinks in an evening a few times a week. Are they at risk?

He wonâ€™t even go to the bank to get money to pay his mortgage. 

Iâ€™m furious with him as he admits he has a problem but lies about drinking and is taking no steps to change. How do I approach the situation?

alcoholism,,"Iâ€™ve never been able to moderate my drinking- so is alcoholism something youâ€™re just born with? I shouldnâ€™t say never, but often. When I first started drinking, I was about 14. I always blacked out. Always drank until I was done or the alcohol was gone. 

Iâ€™ve made horrible choices during black outs and emotionally hurt my long time partner as well. Although I didnâ€™t drink often (once every few months), it was always to excess. 

In the last year, I began to drink more frequently and with that I began to learn moderation. Iâ€™d drink slow, only have one or two. Sometimes a few more if the setting was right, etc. 

Then this weekend I went crazy, blacked out, and acted like a fool. 

So I basically have concluded that I will never moderate my drinking. Is it possible for me, sure, but thereâ€™s always the risk of it ending badly and itâ€™s not worth it. I become a 100% different person and i donâ€™t want that. 

I think I struggled so long with it because Iâ€™m 24 and all my friends still party but they never end up being as crazy as I am. I wanted to just be â€œnormalâ€ it. 

So basically, if not being able to moderate drinking makes you an alcoholic- was I born one since Iâ€™ve never had that ability?"
alcoholism,,"Alcoholic roommate drinks way to much beer My roommate who is also my coworker drinks too much beer and I think the side effects are showing, but I am not sure if it is due to the alcohol, so I don't want to confront him about it unless I am certain.

But lately he has been complaining about how hot it is at work but it's literally below 70 degrees 
The reason I am uncertain is because he is quite a big guy and he can easily down a whole case of beer in a day and only starts too look tipsy after going through the box
From what I have seen he does it close to every other day.

So is it because he is big causing him to complain about the temperature or the excessive beer?"

alcoholism,,"High functioning alcoholism. Hi. Long time lurker, first time poster. It took me a long time to admit that I have a problem because aside from the fact that I have to drink to fall asleep, I typically live a pretty normal life. I have a job, a long-term boyfriend, and I go to classes five days a week. The thing is, I weigh roughly 95 pounds, and I basically have to drink a six pack + two more beers to feel drunk. Iâ€™ve been drinking heavily since I was eighteen and Iâ€™m 25 now, so my tolerance has skyrocketed. I can go through the day feeling just fine, but around 9pm or so the itch starts to kick in. If I try to shrug it off, I get anxious and usually canâ€™t fall asleep until around 5am or later. Sometimes it just feels easier to throw a bunch of beers or some wine back and pass out. I never do anything crazy, ever. I literally got drunk watching King of the Hill last night until I couldnâ€™t keep my eyes open and finally dozed off. When Iâ€™m with my boyfriend, I either donâ€™t drink and deal with the insomnia, or I do and tell him I had a â€œrough dayâ€. I know itâ€™s wrong to keep it from him. I already know. But for a long time my thought process was that if it wasnâ€™t affecting me or our relationship, then why did it matter? Which, yes, is dumb because I know itâ€™s affecting me in the long term. Anyway. I was hoping that I could find people who can relate, or at least wonâ€™t judge me. I havenâ€™t had a drink in two days and (surprise) am miserable. But Iâ€™m trying. For some reason the thought of never drinking again is terrifying, but I guess thatâ€™s a slap in the face as to why I should stop, huh? Yeah. Wish me luck."

Suddenly the phone transferred to a random man who said AYY WE takinâ€™ care of ya mother donâ€™t worry darlin, then the phone switches to another man and basically asks how old I am. I was obviously pissed and scared for her, I was cursing at all these strange men. I had a panic attack and handed the phone to my friend. I started hyperventilating. My friend was yelling at the men and then came to me to see if I was okay. I had called my grandma after and told her everything that happened. We decided to call again and she wasnâ€™t answering, we had probably called her 60 times and she wasnâ€™t picking up. We called my grandma back and let her know she wasnâ€™t answering, my grandma suggested she try calling. She had told me my mom didnâ€™t answer. We all decided to call the cops. We had been waiting for about 30 minutes so by the time we called it was 1:00 am.  We called the cops and they showed up. They questioned us and asked where she may be. My friend was saying WAY too much, she was telling them that my mom drinks a lot 24/7.  My grandfather was there with us and was trying to intervene to get my friend to stop talking. I told them she goes to some bars and looked on her previous Facebook posts of where she liked to go. And it was about 2:30 am when my mom had decided to pull in the driveway. She was so drunk. Basically itâ€™s my house first and my grandparents, she passed my house seeing all the flashing lights and cops and still decided to pull in. ( she pulled into my grandparents drive way and it leads to our driveway) she could have drove by and avoided it. So she pulls up and says whattt is happeeeenning (best I can describe her slurs) then she asks if my dog is okay and thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re here. Immediately they can tell sheâ€™s intoxicated. Basically we were sent inside and the cop comes in and says ur mom wants to know if the dog is okay. I was in utter shock that sheâ€™s worried about the dog and not me. I broke down crying and asked if heâ€™s serious and thatâ€™s the first thing she said to them and he said Iâ€™m so sorry. I said tell her the dogs perfectly fucking fine. He leaves and tells her. From my POV it looked like my mom was resisting arrest. My papa came in and told me she was. But apparently she says she wasnâ€™t. She had been released shortly after. Once she got home she started getting in my friends face. Then I had stepped in front of her and told her to stop and she was making a fool of herself. She was still slightly intoxicated. Fuck the cops for not releasing her when she was sober. Basically my mom had started punching me and grabbing my hair, she had kicked me in my stomach. My grandpa saw all of this 
Basically I was standing in front of the couch and she was standing right in front of me and kicked me so from behind my mom he couldnâ€™t see her kick me. Bizarre that he couldnâ€™t. The last time she beat me like this it was thanksgiving eve because she potatoâ€™s were not peeled and she had tried to strangle my dad and hurt me. But anyways back to this, I had never stood up for myself and fought back before. So I had grabbed her hair and started fighting her back. I had broke her glasses and pushed her into her room. I didnâ€™t want my friend to see this. So we were fighting in her room, she was dirty fighting and kicking me like a little bitch. I had pushed her into the floor and she had fell a bit too so thank god she did. And then she got up and pushed me against the wall and was being horrible and backing me up into a corner, I thought I was gonna die right there. My papa ( grandpa) came storming in and thankfully told her to get off. My grandpa was just yelling and trying to get her off earlier but my moms really strong. Then I went into the my room and mom came in and goes Iâ€™m gonna kill u, then she goes oh I thought u were â€”â€” (my friend) I go Iâ€™m not but ur not gonna touch her, her dads literally a cop. I had followed my mom to my friend and once again here we are. I convinced her to get away and to not start more problems.  She was screaming I WANT THESE LITTLE BITCHES OUT!  Then my papa took me and my friend to her house to drop her off. Once my friend got home she called cops and told them what she did to me. I had told her not to. On our way back to my house my mom was on a different road and was caught by the cops. I was yelling papa thatâ€™s mom! We had driven past once again and we were right. The head cop idk what theyâ€™re called came to me and started screaming at me DID SHE KICK U. I was crying the whole ride and could barley talk. I ignored him, his tone intensified, DID YOUR MOTHER KICK YOU?! I said YES. They asked if I needed an ambulance and did she leave any bruises I said no. There was no bruising. They didnâ€™t arrest her and she agreed to be quiet and okay for the night. They told me I could not be in the house. Basically I had to live with my dad, 2 weeks later I was back home and it was okay. 



NOW- 
My moms getting her license taken away and idk what to do sheâ€™s blaming my friend because they have it on camera, my friend saying a bunch of shit. Apparently they wouldnâ€™t have taken away license if she didnâ€™t say everything she said.  My friend and I have had our ups and downs but weâ€™re trying to get better.  I know everyone must be thinking my moms a piece of garbage but I do love my mom, sheâ€™s so different sober. Sheâ€™s caring, sheâ€™s an animal lover, we do fight but itâ€™s normal, sheâ€™s my mom. My moms been though a lot, sheâ€™s been raped. She opened up to me awhile ago, Iâ€™ve had a really bad experience with a man before aswell. So sheâ€™s kind of understanding of that. I love my mom sheâ€™s the best thing I have. But I donâ€™t know what to do I really wanna be in my friends life and her to be in mine. But today it was declared sheâ€™ll lose her license for 2 years. Because sheâ€™s had a previous dui. We might have to move in with grandma because her job may find out about dui and fire her. Or she may not get rides to work. Iâ€™m trying to get my GED because school wasnâ€™t for me, I was suicidal 24/7. School made me miserable, basically everythingâ€™s depending on her license. Idk what to do. Please help. Thank you if youâ€™ve read this far."
alcoholism,,"Leaving a alcoholic On December 26, 2019 I made the very difficult decision to leave my girlfriend of one year due to her drinking. I had been with this woman for one year. We met in January 2019 in MLK day via a dating app.  Before I said hello to her I knew I found my one as I walked in the restaurant. It was a magical connection. Within the first 2 weeks there were a couple of minor incidents. One was when people from the lighting industry came to Denver for a holiday event, she had gotten so drunk the night before she had to Uber to my place the next day and have me coddle her. A week later, she went to Vegas for 36 hours. Landed in Denver at 3:00 pm and stumbled to my apt absolutely lit up drunk and non functioning. All within 2 weeks.

I thought hmmm but hey itâ€™s early donâ€™t judge. February was the after work drinks of vodka and soda. About 3-5 per night but each our was easily 3-4 shots of vodka. A gallon would be consumed every 3 days and sometimes 2 days. At this point I was becoming concerned. I loved her by now and thought maybe a loving relationship that wasnâ€™t like her marriage might perhaps open her eyes up to reaching her pinnacle with me. For weeks I told her I needed her to take me to the airport in March in the morning for a flight to Florida. Sadly, expecting the worst, I made a backup plan with my 21 year old student I taught at the hospital I was working at.  Sure enough, she drank so much she was unable to take me. At this point I was ready to walk and regrettably did not.

I believed in her and the power of love. By this time we moved in together and there were many great times but the drinking continued. I had plans as a newbie to Denver to try a few restaurants and concert venues. She nearly passed out at Wicked at the performing arts center. Could barely walk and people were staring at her. I was to embarrassed to look up. The night before at red rocks we saw a prince tribute by the Colorado symphony stained ruined before we got the by her drunk and being super overly friendly with the Uber driver. 

Last incident Iâ€™ll share amongst the many weâ€™re the hallucinations in the middle of the night thinking I was face timing other women at 2 am. To me hiding her phone and iPad or me responsible for finding everything from her hair brush, acrylic nails to car keys. Several times she would forget her purse or sunglasses at restaurants and places. It never ended for me. I began to lose myself. I no longer wanted to go out. I stayed on fearing her drunk. I would tell staff and her hair stylist to not serve her as much when we would show up and she got livid at me for that. I became a shell of myself. I fell into deep depression and became angry punching doors no less. I never did that. I saw the love of my life falling into the abyss and me no longer caring. 

After 2.6 years in Denver I packed up and moved to St. Louis to get as far away from her and Denver. I hated Denver after her. Ruined my dreams and vision I had there. A happy home. A great partner and a future filled with endless opportunities. 

Why do I feel so miserable and guilty like I quit? For fucks sake I feel so lonely and depressed. Iâ€™m 47, in shape, educated and a huge hear. She was 45 and a sales professional. I wake up thinking about her. All day all night hoping for a miracle that she will quit drinking after losing me and will search for me again, I feel like hell and I canâ€™t stop crying, this really changed me. Any advice? Why the guilt? Why the love? Why the hoping someday again? Appreciate it.

alcoholism,,"Alcoholism is like that one friend... Itâ€™s like that one friend. You have a great time. Then you hang out again. And itâ€™s fun. You guys click and the chemistry is great. Then one day they just show up unexpected. Youâ€™re ok with it. Then again. And again. Now theyâ€™ve worn out their welcome. But you keep letting them in. Now you canâ€™t get them off your couch. You donâ€™t know what to do. The cops show up and they leave for a day or two. Then again. Finally youâ€™ve had enough. Theyâ€™ve put you through hell and worn you down. Theyâ€™ve made you do things you normally wouldnâ€™t; theyâ€™re such a bad influence. They took your money, kept you up at night... Your relationship started out great. It was fun. But in the end the friendship just had to end. So you cut ties. You told them it was over. It was hard but you did it. Last time you ever saw them was years ago and youâ€™re living life to the fullest. Youâ€™re sleeping, your job is going great. Everything is great. Then a friend comes over with that old friend one day and being the new better person you are you respectfully say hi, shake hands and go on your way. Itâ€™s been 2.5 years since Iâ€™ve seen that friend. If that friend is on your couch be strong and tell them to leave. Youâ€™ll thank yourself that you did. Some friends just donâ€™t fit right in the end and thatâ€™s ok, thereâ€™s more to life."
alcoholism,,"Honestly, fuck drinking alcoholicly This shit sucks... it's hard to eat, my stomach is killing me, I'm tired, I feel sick, I'm pissing/shitting once an hour, I'm ditching work, I'm skipping workouts, I'm gaining weight, my mental health is declining again.... at least I'm calm though ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸ but when I stop. It's like I've just downed 12 coffees on an empty stomach and it's like that everyday, head spinning, anxious, dizzy, nauseous, tingly hands/feet and miserable. I don't know which state is worse. At least when I'm drunk I'm calm, oh so calm, it's wonderful."
alcoholism,,"Should I expect or be concerned about withdrawals? So hereâ€™s the deal. Iâ€™m typically a night time drinker. Maybe something like 6-9 drinks a night if I have work the next day. In the past i would drink like this most but not every night. For the last month or so Iâ€™ve only not drank at night for like a day and a half. I typically go through a fifth of vodka every 2-3 days. This past weekend I was out of town for a wedding and hit it pretty hard so Iâ€™ve decided I should give my liver a rest and change my drinking habits once and for all.

My last drink was yesterday around midnight. Itâ€™s currently 8:15 pm. I havenâ€™t had any symptoms with the exception of anxiety, but Iâ€™m a naturally anxious person. 

I always figured even though I drink just about everyday, Iâ€™m sober for more hours in a day than not. Should I expect or be worried about serious withdrawals?"
alcoholism,,"Am I an alcoholic? I drink at the most once a month. Sometimes I get blackout drunk and do stupid or mean things, do I need to stop drinking completely? And if so how do I go about it? Do I need to go to meetings?"
alcoholism,,"A story about second chances This is my story of how much of an idiot a single person can be.

I'm writing this from the seat next to my hospital bed. Enjoying a rich tea biscuit and coffee. The amount of guilt and remorse over my nieveity is completely overwhelming. So much that I am actually crying. 

I'm here because I have a serious problem with alcohol. I've always known it, yet despite this knowledge, I persist with going through the cycle of binge drinking to the point of almost annihilation, hitting the depths of crippling withdrawals, where I'm physically incapable of even standing. I go through a painful recovery, vowing to never drink again. I'll be successful in my sobriety for maybe a month. And build my life back up. Seemingly recovered. That's when I decide, ""I can have a couple, I'm ok now. I've got a job, I'm back on track. I'm not going to let myself decend back in to that situation again"". Yeah right. It happens again. And again. And so many times that nobody knows how many times I've done this whole routine. Drink to the point of collapse, pick myself up, regain momentum, the trust of others, become human again. Well the thing is with humans as we all know is they are predictable creatures that follow the same patterns. Why do you think people have routines? Why do you think we have tradition? Why is it that we have sayings like ""once a crook, always a crook""? I could go on, but you get my point.

So here I, this human, is again. Sat on a hospital ward. Taking medications designed to hinder the effects of serious alcohol misuse. With the same guilt as I felt last time. With the same determination to never be here again. With the same plan to get counciling. With the same lump in my throat. The same feelings of pain inside. Except this time. I've decided, I'm not going to try and fix myself. Patch up the beaten and rundown shell of a person. Instead, I'm going to kill that person. He once existed. But just like all things that existed, that's all they did, they exist in the past. Not the present or the future. 

When a person is born. They aren't manufactured in a factory with exact specifications. Like a product designed to a perform a certain task that has exact limitations on its capabilities. You can build a car and that car is that car and it has it's own strengths and it's own weaknesses. You can ad parts here and there and it with perform slightly better at certain things. But it's still the same car. No matter what. 

It takes a lot of designing an engineering to make anything good. It also takes a lot of reengineering and trial and error to create a truly magnificent specimen. Nobody in the history of the planet has ever hit the nail on the head the very first time. Ever heard of the Delorean? It takes time and conscientiousness for something to become truly great. Elon Musk blew up his first three rockets costing billions. In fact his first successful launch, had it not worked would have been his last, because he had no more cash left to perform another. So sometimes it's better to not aim for immediate perfection because in the end, it will ultimately fail. No matter how sure you think you are. 

Three weeks ago. I was sailing smoothly. I was about to get my driver's license back after an almost 8 year absence. I was working a high pressure IT contractor job that paid handsomely. My own place. And my proud and loving father, in preperation for the return of me regaining road legal status. Had bought me a car that he knew I would love. It wasnt anything fancy, but he knew I would love and cherish that car like a baby. He went out of his way to get ot certified for road use. He fixed it up where it needed work. Himself, with his own two hands. He fitted parts that didn't even need doing. He just wanted to give me something to be proud of. I was so happy and appreciated it so much. Everything was looking good and everything was on track. All we had to do is wait for my license in the mail. It got to Christmas. We had a lovely Christmas Day together. Things were looking so great in fact, when I got home I figured I'll have few beers. And then that's when it all went pear shaped. I finished the beers and I didn't really feel like I was happy enough, so I got a few more. The next thing I knew I was black out drunk. By this point is was the next day. Me in my drunken stupor decided ""FLIP IT! IM GONNA JUST GET FULL ON DRUNKED UP TODAY"" Which carried on to the next day. By this point I had been ignoring calls. So I figured people are gonna know somethings up. So I locked the door, turned the lights out and made the decision that if anyone comes knocking, I'll just make it seem like no one's home. Two weeks pass. By this point my body was completely dependent on alcohol to the point where I couldn't even get a jacket on with any sort of ease because of the withdrawal. My apartment had descend in to a disgusting mess. I was a mess. And all I could think about is how much of a disgrace I am. I had completely betrayed my dad. He didn't deserve the treatment I was giving him. He's done so much for me and would never ever do this to me or anyone else, so why was I doing this to him? Because I was ashamed? Because I was scared? I decided to open the door. He didn't even need to say his piece. His eyes said it all. 

He left. And I was alone. Fighting the worst withdrawals I had ever faced. A day or two go by. The symptoms begin to subside. I conger the strength to begin the clean up operation. I do bits here and there. But I'm weak. And it's hard. I'm shaking. I'm sweating. It comes and goes. But I cant sleep. My sides are hurting but I know it's just inflammation and will subside eventually. And then the visual flashes start. The phantom noises. I'm hallucinating all over the place. And so I try and sleep. But when i close my eyes something I've never known occurred. I was still seeing things. Things like from a dream. And its intense. From disgusting creatures about to attack me to me flying directly to the ground. So many things I can even begin to describe. So I'm laid awake alone, with the light on because in the dark the outside hallucinations are there. I'm in hell. This is full on Delirium Tremons or DT. Which is one of the most likely things to kill you without sedatives. I call an ambulance. In the hospital the bloods show I have pancreatitis. And that I'm most likely going to need immediate surgery. Then move me to the surgical decisions unit. Put me in a room on my own. So now all I can think about is how I've completely fucked my life. How have I become this? Was it worth it? I might die. And all I can think about is how my guilty my dads gonna feel at my funeral. Something he 100% does not deserve. He's the best dad anyone could have ever asked for. He would do anything for his kids. This isn't his fault. At all. On that bed all I wanted to tell him is how he's not to blame. How much i love him. And how much I admire him. But I can't. And the most horrible thing is, is that I'm his only son. The curtain opens and it's a specialist on pancreatitis. She asked me to explain everything. So I do. She says to me. ""Well from looking at your bloodwork, people with pancreatitis have certain markers. Usually we would expect to see a level of 600. Yours is 100. So it doesn't make sense why you've been referred to us. I'm going to go and speak with one of me other colleagues and see if there's anything I'm missing"" she leaves. I dont even care about the second opinion, I cant flippin believe it!! I a flippin miracle!! In my eyes I've been given a second chance. I'm crying like crazy. Even though he hates me right now I didn't care all i want to do is call my dad and tell him how sorry I am. But its 3.30am and I dont think he would appreciate that very much. 

I text my dad in the morning. Tell him I'm here. And not much else. 

I text him again and give him the rundown of my intentions. And now were talking again. And that to me is all I need.

Thanks for reading my story full of typos and grammatical errors. But I'm sat on the chair next to my hospital bed as we speak and the top half of my touch screen doesn't work so it's pretty hard to correct stuff.

Any way , we hadn't seen each other in a month ,we happened to run into each other , I opened my big mouth asking had he read a Reddit comment (s) about alcoholism and had he read it ? Answered not yet , but promised he would definitely read it today.. Well he's still a smooth dog ,a player from way back , and had me promising 3 meetings , in return that he would take a look at my text and join Reddit. But did so very very much like he did in his drinking days, Sneaky calm , smooth , under handed ,kiniving , manipulative ,told some white lies,said it would be great  and with his bullshit , I'm going to a meering( (1) meeting. Don't want to go at all , but I was taken advantage of by a dog.My brother is a dog. Still.  This is a rant . Thanks for reading it.

alcoholism,,"When is it safe to start working out again So Iâ€™m on day 4 of my complete alcohol purge cold turkey. I have not had a lot of withdrawal symptoms (some sweating and some restlessness). I had was unaware that alcohol withdrawal could kill you until yesterday and flipped my shit when I called a rehab center and said I could be at risk for detox related death for months. 

Iâ€™ve been working and have a general sense of happiness. I have had some issues sleeping but I chalk that up to the mass amounts of caffeine and b vitamins  I regularly consume and now not having a â€œgo to sleep remedy.â€ Also I typically work out about 2 hours a day but heard my heart can be sensitive for some time during withdrawal period. Is there a time period where I should most likely be safe to do extensive cardio again?

alcoholism,,"Coping with Withdrawal I think I might be experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms (chills, sweats, headache, muscle soreness and fatigue, nausea), but I cannot seek medical treatment. What should I keep in mind while I tough it out?

alcoholism,,"my girlfriend is an alcoholic and I just don't know what to do I just wanted someone to talk to. I feel so alone in real life because I don't have anyone who would understand. I am so heartbroken and tired. Is there such a thing as AA for people whose loved ones are alcoholics? I might need to go for that, if it exists. I am starting to feel like I desperately need help myself.

My girlfriend is just.. a horrible person when she drinks. She becomes this really angry, cruel, irrational, violent person. She says terrible things to me, which I can't help but feel are her honest feelings that she's only letting out when she's been drinking. It's awful because she's so different when she's sober. It makes me feel like I'm dating two people. Or rather, it makes me feel like I need to figure out which one is the real personality, if that makes sense. 

I used to think that the sober her was the real personality, but recently I've been losing hope. I've been feeling like she's actually been Mr Hyde all along. The reason why I've been losing hope is because we had a big fight about her drinking some time back, and she agreed that it was ruining her life and that she had to quit. I told her it was okay to do it at her own pace and that all I wanted was transparency. Meaning that I wanted to know how often she was drinking, and how much. Because I was quite sure that she drank much more often than I knew about, and I felt like it would help if a) she could be more conscious of when and how much she was drinking, and b) if I could get a better sense for how bad her problem was. 

She's tried quitting before, but not very seriously. She's supposed to be going to AA now, but obviously I don't know if/when she's actually going. I don't really want to go into it because I'm so worn down already, but suffice to say that recently I keep accidentally-or-otherwise discovering that she's been drinking but didn't tell me/outright lied about it. Or otherwise meaning that she appeared obviously drunk, so I questioned her until she admitted that she'd been drinking. That's one thing that's really awful by the way. The way she'll be so obviously drunk but refuse to admit that she's been drinking. It makes me feel like, if she's willing to lie about this stuff, and in fact if that's her first instinct, then what else has she been lying about? It makes me feel... bad, as well, almost ashamed, because I feel like I've allowed myself to be abused. Or that I've been stupid for believing in her all this time.

I don't really know what to do. Since not drinking is self-reported, I guess part of me wonders if she'll just lie at AA like she's been lying to me. At one point she was visibly drunk, and she insisted to me that she was going to receive her one month chip in a few days. I don't know if she genuinely had been sober for the rest of the month before that, but it's pretty obvious that she wouldn't qualify for a one month chip now. Would an alcoholic lie just to get the chip? Would AA find out? I don't see how AA could find out unless they admitted to it, or they came into a meeting drunk. 

I don't know what to do. I really don't. If any of you have any advice or words of comfort, I would really appreciate it."
alcoholism,,"Day one of sobriety Iâ€™ve just poured all my alcohol down the drain and decided todayâ€™s the day I become sober. After two years of constant drinking day in and out, Iâ€™ve finally made the decision to end it. I feel so relieved, I just hope and pray Iâ€™m able to follow through with this without breaking. No one knows about my drinking problem so I have to do this on my own and itâ€™s scary but Iâ€™m ready for the better version of myself once I see this threw."
alcoholism,,"Alcohol Withdrawal? Hangover? Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right sub but here goes. Iâ€™ve been a heavy drinker for the last couple years due to college. I was in a fraternity that often saw me drinking heavily minimum 3x a week ranging all the way to 6x a wk. The goal was usually to get as drunk as possible every time because I had social anxiety and I thought it helped. However I wouldnâ€™t-consider myself dependent and only drank in social situations. Never alone. Around my Junior year I started experiencing weird hangover symptoms that I at first attributed to getting older, but it seemed like something more. They involved extreme bouts of anxiety and depression to the point were I couldnâ€™t leave my bed and my body felt off. This only happened if I had drank in extreme excess the night before or heavy for 3 or more days prior, if it was just one day I was fine.

Fast forward to my senior year and I am now getting these more frequently were my body felt off, and I was hit with insane bouts of anxiety. But it got really bad after one particularly heavy wknd of drinking. I woke up that day feeling horrid, completely nauseated, anxiety, shakes. I was incredibly nauseous and tried making myself throw up. After this I couldnâ€™t stop throwing up for the rest of the day probably over 20times. As soon as anything touched my stomach extreme naseau. The worse part lasted about a day but I didnâ€™t feel fully recovered for another 2-3 days.

This year I graduated and went back to visit for a big day long drinking event. I had not been drinking significantly since I graduated a couple months prior, maybe once every couple weeks. Went up for the weekend and drank everyday and on the day of the event, I consumed pedialyte in the morning and ate breakfast and lunch. Although I didnâ€™t eat dinner and drank little to no water all day. Spent the whole day drinking non stop also. The next day driving back the same thing from before starts happening I initially woke up with the shakes. Feeling depressed and nauseous. Felt worse as the day went on and got food. Food didnâ€™t help made me more nauseous. Got to the point where I could barely move or talk to not get sick. When I got home I started throwing up and couldnt stop like previously but this time it was way worse. I felt like my body was shutting down, im not sure if I was delirious as this was a while ago but I remember feeling like I was going to have a seizure or something was going to happen( even though I had nvr experienced one before). Very confused and out of sorts. It got so bad I thought I was gna have to go the hospital. Thought Iâ€™d feel better after 2days but still felt like shit for 5 days.

So I basically want to know if anyone has experienced something similar or knows what is happening. After researching the closest thing I found to my symptoms was withdrawal, but I thought this is only the case when youâ€™ve been drinking everyday over a long period. Is this just some weird hangover. Please help.

Also note I know this is a sign I should cut down regardless. But I still want to be able to go out and drink with my friends. Now that college is over I donâ€™t go out nearly as much, and I only drink at social settings. But sometimes Iâ€™m scared if I overdo it one night this will happen."
alcoholism,,If I could just cut my drinking bullshit I'd stop smoking cigarettes When I started smoking at 15 I just smoked most of the time but for the last two years almost im just totally put off to the idea of smoking if im sober. I could potentially get the double kill here but fuck I'm scared of quitting alcohol.
alcoholism,,I donâ€™t know how to stop and be happy/ stay alive. I had started drinking and drugging a few years back. I stopped using daily about 9 months ago and started only using socially.

It feels good for the first 15 minutes then I feel worse than I did before the drink hit me. I donâ€™t want to go down that path again but I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll hurt myself in a drastic way if I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m just kinda venting and donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for posting here. Thank you
alcoholism,,"Idk help me Ok throwaway.   I'm 40 FM divorced once with 2 children. Never was onto drugs or drank until 25 or so and slowly crept into 30s. Drank through then until early 30s and stopped easily when I had kids.  21 months apart.  Was scared to ease back into it. Easily did I feel back into it. Always maintained a high paying job. Kids are great.  Ended up becoming highly successful. Divorced. Amicable.  Met a great guy 3 years ago. Great relationship.  Hes highly successful.  I'm doing great.  Kids are great.  Then I found myself drinking a handle of rum over 3 days.  Still remained my schedule.  Got the kids to school fine. Worked great. My SO rarely drinks. I drink every night.  I like it. My mind can rest. I produce better when I'm under the influence with work
  Things around the house are done. Since it's not what he does he considered it bad. I did a blood panel and it came out fine. He insists I am killing myself and 0ur relationship and I don't now what to conclude


We came up with 3 things to better ourselves and he wants me to quit. I do nothing outside of drinking and when I stop I go crazy.  I cant sleep. I cant be not annoyed. I have unrest and am mad. What is this?"
alcoholism,,"Coworker is constantly drinking at work.. what can I do? I have my own big issues with alcohol, but Iâ€™m looking for some advice since Iâ€™ve never been on this side of it, where I know someone has a problem and they promised to get in under control, but they arenâ€™t. 

Heâ€™s been employed for a few months now, and my boss was about to fire him for being late and always smelling of alcohol everyday. This isnâ€™t the sort of position you can drink in, he has to climb high shelves on ladders and stuff. He said he knew and it wouldnâ€™t happen again. He hasnâ€™t been late since, but heâ€™s smelling stronger of alcohol everyday. I kinda was behind the scenes asking my boss to give him a second chance, but I guess heâ€™s a typical alcoholic thinking heâ€™s sneaky. 

I donâ€™t want to be direct and tell him heâ€™s not as sneaky as he thinks, that would be a bad idea right?  Iâ€™m not his boss, I was the one to train him. Heâ€™s a really great worker and a nice guy aside from the booze. Last thing I want is for him to fall and break his neck while I was aware of all of this.. 

So I donâ€™t know, should I mention this to the boss to fire him, or do I let him know that most of his coworkers know and it canâ€™t continue? Should I open up 1 to 1 about my own problem with it? Or just get him fired? :( this situation is kind of eye opening about what my family had to go through with me. Itâ€™s hard, and he isnâ€™t even family."
alcoholism,,"Looking for tips on addressing a loved ones alcoholism. Hello all.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am looking for some tips and advice on what to do and how to approach my father to speak with him about his alcoholism. 

He is a very highly functioning alcoholic, with many many years under his belt. Him and I have a wonderful relationship, and he respects me very much. But I have never confronted him about his alcoholism before. Honestly, his drinking has never had a negative physical impact on me, he has never been abusive (physically, verbally, or otherwise) to me. I canâ€™t say the same for my brother and sister though, he can be very mean and verbally abusive when he gets belligerent and it has caused a tremendous strain on his relationship with my sister. For me though, it just makes me tremendously sad.

A few years back things got bad when he was arrested for a domestic dispute, and I had really hoped that it was a wake up call for him but it doesnâ€™t seem so. Us kids are all grown up now in our 20s but he recently had another son who is 3 now (who I love very much). He has expressed to me that he is looking to be a better father for his new son, and I think that is wonderful. He hasnâ€™t been the worlds greatest dad but he is my best friend and beneath his troubles he is a good man. I had thought things had gotten better until recently.

It was brought to my attention during a visit a few months ago by his wife that he started drinking again. Low and behold I found his stash, about 8 or so handles of various liquor, many at least half empty. It broke my heart. And over Christmas we had gone to visit and he was openly drinking. I havenâ€™t seen him drink in 3 years... I am not naive, it wasnâ€™t surprising to hear that he was drinking again. But to actually see it... and then to add on to the shock, later in the night in front of his wife and my fiancÃ©, he offered whiskey in my cider, and on impulse I had accepted. Just as he started pouring whiskey into my drink my heart SANK and i felt nothing but regret and disgust for myself, normalizing his behavior. 

I am just so worried. For years, time and time again, he has been able to get out of trouble because he can afford good lawyers, and truthfully he has never felt real life-affecting consequences as a result of his actions. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before he hurts himself, someone else or his family...

I just want to talk to him about it because as I said, I have never talked to him about it, confronted him, nothing. He has so much going for him, a wonderful handsome baby boy and a wife who cares about him very much, but she is starting to lose control and is realizing it and has reached out to me and my fiancÃ© for help, something, anything. I know that itâ€™s not actually my job to do that, but since I have never tried before in my life, I really want to.

Im afraid that he isnâ€™t going to live much longer if he continues to unravel. Whether it be liver cancer, rolling his car drunk, or losing his family and blowing his brains out or something horrible, I truly do not think its going to end well.  

Any advice or tips or anything would be wonderful and much appreciated. Sorry for the rant too, I donâ€™t really get to express this often at all since my family doesnâ€™t really talk about it and I only have my fiancÃ© to about this."
alcoholism,,I'm 23 and got drunk almost everyday for 6 years straight I can't rationalize a good reason to fully quit alcohol even though I know it has a negative effect on my mood/body. I've never done anything crazy bad while drinking but I've used it as a way to kill time for years of living alone (4 years). I pretty much just play games and get drunk every night and have around 1-2 off days per week. When I have taken a week or 2 off of drinking before I've noticed I felt incredible. But there hits a point where its like ok this is pointless I want to get drunk because I'm bored or sick of the day or just want to have fun. Not sure what I'm really asking besides what is your opinion/advice on this?
alcoholism,,I donâ€™t know where else to go. Hi all. Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the right place but Iâ€™m lost. I need help but I canâ€™t do it.

alcoholism,,"Moment of Clarity Sooo i just wrote a really long fucking inspirational post and accidently hit back and lost it.  So long story short:

I had a moment of clariry today.  Day 4 no alcohal after I went on a bender that resulted in such a bad hangover i puked so much i lost my voice (not the first time thats happened im a puker). I started off just a 3 day break get it out of my system then drink moderately ( lie ive told myself  many times).  But I was out for coffee today and normally when im out i look at people and wish I could be living  a normal fulfilling life like them. But today when I had that thought I stopped and thought I am I am like them!  I have an amazing life its just my addictions that are pulling me down and making me feel that way. 

 So on the way home i cried! (I dont usually express emotion like that unless im drinking) I cried for the younger me the experiences she missed out on and the insecirities and anger she felt.  How she couldnt deal with her emotions how she was numb througout her whole college experience! But i cried happy because i know if i had smartened up and sobered up at 15 when it was first a problem (im 27) 12 of the fucking prime years of life numbed but I'm still happy cause I wouldnt be where im at today.  I would have continued with engineering.  I wouldnt have my amazing job at Sequoia National Park and my amazing Nigerian boyfriend. (Bragging i know lol). But now i like where i am i think i wanna stay so i wanna try and quit for good! 

 He has expressed his concerns about weed and alcohal use and i know i will eventually lose him if i dont quit! And as i work in trails alcohal is prevelant and forgiven often but im still on a path to making huge mistakes at work if i dont sober up. I cry happy knowing something is different this time at least i fucking pray it is! Its only day 4 and i am taking it day by day but i feel so good about it today i just wanted to share! After i accidently deleted my first post (which was much better i promise) I almost just said fuck it. But i wanted to share this feeling. Because  I think  Its really because of others sharing their stories on this page and the one for quitting weed that i feel stronger this time.  

I hate the labels of addict and alcohalic.  I was terrified of going to AA (im not religious) or even other groups cause i thought going in ment this is it no more and that thought terrified me.  ( ive known ive had a problem for a while but only really tried to stop and moderate in the last 2 years).  Combing through this page reading all the scary,sad, inspirational stories has given me that sense of community and higher power i was too scared to seek elsewhere. So thank you guys! Keep it up!"
alcoholism,,"I'm an alcoholic and I need to quit, but I also have to do it alone. Please help. The title pretty much says it. I drink alot, like 200 ounces a day of anywhere from 6-14% beer for a long time. It's destroying my life and I just can't seem to stop. I'm watching everything fall apart down my nose over a beer can and I just keep chugging. I need help, but I'm viewed in such a way that I cannot ask for help or go-to a hospital or anything, I have to solo it. I've read about all the symptoms and I'm ready to deal with it, but is there any advice from anyone else that has done it alone? I can't keep doing this to everyone that loves me. I will lose them all. 

Any advice would help."
alcoholism,,Purposely getting blacked out Iâ€™m a bartender &amp; I drink about 6 days a week. I write it off because I see sooooooo many people do it everyday. But Iâ€™m also getting black out drunk for almost 2 weeks now. Maybe 5 times... I do it on purpose. Right before my last shot I know itâ€™s gonna be the one I black out at. I canâ€™t remember shit &amp; I just hope I didnâ€™t make a fool of myself around the people I see all the time. I havnt tried to stop because I already tell myself I canâ€™t. I think I just wanna forget. I like still doing things but not being there mentally. Any advice?
alcoholism,,"Energy + mental acuity = my desire to drink. Been having alcohol issues since my divorce in 2014....use to drunk cuz it hurt so bad. Now I drink because Iâ€™m addicted.

I have to admit, Iâ€™ve been doing â€œbetterâ€ these past couple months. I went 12 days without drinking, then 10, then 10 again.......problem is, I just canâ€™t calm down. My mind races and I cannot sit still. I alternate between sleeping a lot to barley sleeping at all. 

During my â€œsoberâ€ times, I get a lot done. I invented a new sport that my uncle, who is a sports fan, believes is â€œgeniusâ€. Itâ€™s called Lawball. Iâ€™ll have to send yâ€™all my draft at some point. 

I also get real depressed for like 3 days after I drink. I got someone from Michigan who still wants to come down to f me ffs...yet I cannot get it together. I may have an â€œIQâ€ of 127...but that donâ€™t mean crap if you got a malfunctioning prefrontal cortex with shrunken amygdalaâ€™s. Iâ€™m the kind of man who â€œwants candy and wants candy nowâ€. I try so hard to use my intellect to counteract the addictive part of my brain. It sucks."
alcoholism,,"How do I continue to hold on to a reason to stay sober? 5 days from now I will have been completely free of alcohol for 11 months. Prior to my sobriety, I drank until I blacked out every night for just around 4 years  

Last February I spent 1.5 months in the ICU with life-threatening pancreatitis, severe liver and stomach damage, and a long list of other health problems directly caused by years of alcohol abuse. I have yet to fully recover and likely never will. This was a serious turning point in my life and I have been able to successfully stay sober, although, I will add, it has been incredibly difficult. 

As I near 11 months and soon a full year of sobriety, I am ashamed to say that I have found myself thinking more often about drinking again. The doctors and surgeons who essentially brought me back to life all warned me that if I ever drink again I would almost certainly die. Even though I know this information, I can't help but think more and more about drinking.

I want to believe that I am strong enough to abstain from drinking, but as the 11 and 12 month anniversary of my sobriety approach I feel immense shame and I've been beating myself up over it. 

Is it common to feel like complete shit around anniversaries? I don't know how to talk about this with others. I hid my drinking from everyone around me, and I've continued to hide my past as well as my struggles with sobriety. If anybody has tips on sobriety in the long term, I would greatly appreciate it. All I feel is despair when I think about how much I have fucked up my life."

alcoholism,,"How can I support the ones I love dealing with alcoholism? Hope this makes sense. 
My (F19) partner (M20) and I have been together for nearly 2 1/2 years. Since we started dating his dad has sunken into a deep depression that involves intense alcoholism. 
My partner and his brothers (20 &amp; 17) have tried so much to help him. Every time we go over to his house for dinner he gets drunk and goes into a deep depressive zone that my bf has to deal with. We rarely actually have dinner. 

My bf isnâ€™t a talker, so Iâ€™m kept in the dark about quite a lot of the day to day details of his dadâ€™s life, but I know itâ€™s not going well. 
People his dads age are having a go at my bf and his brothers for not doing enough, and for not loving their father endlessly, despite having no idea how much time, effort and stress the boys put into helping their dad. 

Basically i guess Iâ€™m trying to ask, how can I support my bf and his brothers through all this? Iâ€™m a talker when it comes to emotions and stress, so to have my bf be the complete opposite has me at a loss. Iâ€™m worried about their dad and them, but eometimes my bf will snap at me or crack it at me for asking how theyâ€™re all doing, which is understandable because heâ€™s stressed about it, but it means I donâ€™t know how else to help him.

What kind of external support helped you through it all, whether being the child of an alcoholic or a former alcoholic yourself.


Thank you"

I've almost gotten used to them, been having them for about  a year, but they can freak me out too, when they come on suddenly out of nowhere... just 1 then it stops for a while. I've been recently cutting back on drinking and maybe this is a symptom of my body adjusting after years of nightly consumption... hmmmmm"

It ruins my health, my body -I started hitting the gym 6-7 months ago and progress is slowed by alcohol-, my bank account...

Yesterday I went out again. I was supposed to wake up at 5 and go to work. Obviously I didn't, because I wasn't even at home when 5 stroke on the clock. 

During this evening I paid a lot, I tripped over my feet, hurted my left leg, and broke my phone's screen.

alcoholism,,"I dont know what to do anymore I'm an alcoholic. Obviously. I use to drink 2-3 handles a week. I went through horrible withdrawal and tried to straighten up with the help of my doctors. I did get better but I wasnt clean. I went from handles to a fifth a week. Then I got down to a fifth maybe every other week, if that. Holidays came around and my alcoholic brain made it an excuse to drink and I fell back in the rabbit hole. 

The worst thing about my addiction is i have really bad anxiety. I was diagnosed long before i had an addiction. When i couldnt see my dr anymore, i used alcohol to dilute the world and make things easier. It worked for a while. But then, my hangovers werent just headaches and nausea. They were severe anxiety that landed me in the hospital with gastritis, withdrawal, hallucinations, nightmares and panic attacks.

I continue to drink through the typical holiday events and it lead to my rabbit hole. I had a few drinks and I was fine the next day but was slightly hungover. I'm sure most of you know the ""hair of the dog"" trick. So I tried. I took 3 shots and cut myself off. That night I fell back again. I was afraid to go to sleep. I felt like when I started to drift, I was dying. Like my heart would stop or I'd forget to breathe. Its almost like restless leg syndrome but its your whole body and your brain. 

I have successfully gone a couple weeks without alcohol. But I had so much stress at the time, tonight I decided I'd drink a little. I only bought a fifth and I have no intention of drinking all of it or even drinking again anytime soon. 

My fiance got mad and went to stay elsewhere. Understandable. Hes the one that's had to take me to the hospital and hold me at night while I cry and thrash because not only am I angry at myself, but he doesnt want to watch me kill myself. 

I just dont know how to stop. I do so well for long periods of time but I always go back. Even when I'm literally afraid I wont wake up. I'm scared. I dont want to lose him.

If I have something to lament, I drink. This is nothing new. 

I am too fearful to use the drugs that kill me fast. I turn to the drugs that slowly dull my mind and erode my being slowly and deliberately. Alcohol fits me. It makes me feel confident enough to breathe without fear. It gives me respite from the depression and anxiety. Were they incidental to the substance abuse, or are they the instigators?

I never once thought about getting full custody with the kids because:
   1. I don't want our daughters (7 and 10) to not be able to see their mom regularly
    2. I feel it would only hurt my ex mentally and cause her to drink more often

Since she got out of rehab she has relapsed twice (that I know of), the second time was on the last day of school before Xmas break. She called me that day and said she had broken up with her boyfriend and was in bad way(she was sobbing). She was on her way to pick up our girls. I told her to stop by my place and I'd cook dinner.

When she arrived she reaked of beer. Halfway through dinner I went out to her car and there was an open container. She picked are kids up from school drunk.

I waited for the kids to go to bed to talk with her. I told her that was strike 2 and strike 3 was me getting full custody. I felt like she knew the gravity of the situation.

A week passed and she started out patience rehab, 3X a week. Last Friday she calls me at 2PM, sobbing, and I eventually got her to admit she was drunk. She was scheduled to pick up the girls that day.


What do I need to do here? She has no freinds or family near us. She has a great job and makes twice as much as I do. This allows our kids to live a good life."

alcoholism,,"Eye opening blackout Iâ€™ve been 12 days sober since I had an experience that scared me. I was watching the Patriots vs Titans game at a bar alone because I couldnâ€™t get it to stream on my tv. Iâ€™m a 29 year old female and I am fairly sociable. I ended up making some new acquaintances and having several drinks with my new found fellow Patriots fans. I remember being at the 1st bar after the game and then things get really hazy. I know I walked next door to the other bar and then the night is lost. I have about 8-10 hours of unaccounted time. I know there was another bar after that because of transactions on my bank card. I have no receipt for an Uber or Lyft. I woke up the next morning in my apartment with no memory of getting there, with an opened condom wrapper on my night stand. There was a condom in my trash can but it looked like it had been put on but not really used if you know what I mean. Physically it did not feel like I had intercourse in that blackout period. I also woke up with a big bruise on my knee, bloody knee cap, and an extremely painful elbow, meaning I had a pretty hard fall that I obviously donâ€™t remember.

The blackout I experienced was slightly terrifying and I know I am lucky because that stranger could have done whatever they wanted to me and I would have woken up with no idea who they were. I still donâ€™t know who this guy was, but Iâ€™m glad he made the decision to not completely take advantage of me.

Me and my friend used to binge drink together years ago in our early 20's. Since then I seemed to learn moderation, and moved on/moved to another state 500 miles away. We still talk on the phone several times a week so were still pretty close.

My friend still lives at home with his parents. His dads an alcoholic too so I think they're far to desensitized to the whole thing. He will go through short 3 day burst of not drinking(probably cause hes broke) and then go right back to drinking 7+% IPAs. Like multiple days in a row. Like drinking through hangovers which blows my mind. Getting wasted and driving all over town.

I'm afraid he's going to get a DUI or diabetes or something since hes a heavier dude, and his dad has that as well. Almost more than that I'm afraid that the drinking is emotionally stunting him, and hes never going to grow up, and move out of his parents house, and get a girlfriend. Generally just never mature into an adult.

How can I bring my concerns up to him without seeming like I'm judging him, or how can i help give him the tools to help himself.

She likes to believe that those closest things her can not recognize it.  I am not sure what to do.  I am afraid if I address it in anyway she will withdraw from me.  On the other hand, how can I watch her drown and not do anything.  Will she be able to pull herself out of this? Who knows?  Like all relationships it is somewhat complex.

Iâ€™m not an alcoholic but I recently saw a story about former footballer Paul Gascoigne saying he spent Â£20k on getting anti-alcohol pellets sewn into his stomach.

alcoholism,,"Mother is alcoholic, don't know what to do My mother has binge drunk most her life, shes 57, the thing is drink seems to affect her abnormaly, she changes into a completely different person, an evil horrible person with the mentality of an infant, it's literally like the exorcist, and I hate the person she is while shes drunk.

New year's eve she took an overdose and shes drinking every day now, it's hard to be there for her because I hate her when shes drunk, any sympathy I feel for her is insincere when shes drunk and it's just hard to maintain, she has done unforgivable things while drunk but I quickly forgave her for all of them, for example boxing day she told me her now ex bf gave her a black eye, after seeing the 'black eye' I immediately payed him a visit and attacked him. Turns out she just had a rash around her eyes and she was lying.

On top of the drink she is severely depressed, she still dwells on things that happened 30 years ago, shes never changed, theres been no personal growth her whole life, shes just stuck in the same destructive loop.

She has no drive to do anything about it.

I am the only person in the world who she trusts, I don't want to abandon her, but I have ambitions, strict routines to follow to get where i want to go.

She ruined my mental health as a child, i was going down the same road as her but iv broke her legacy, my life is dedicated to personal growth.

I don't want to sacrifice my own life for hers because shes not doing anything about her issues, nothing, no effort.

She says she has an alcoholics meeting Tuesday but I am 90 percent sure she won't go.

Her mom, dad and sister are all dead and before they died they all became victims of endless depression, also alcoholism aside from her sister.

I just don't know what to do, I have started having reaccuring horrible nightmares involving her when shes drunk.

Her sense of dread and hopelessness is infectious, the more I'm there with her, the more she drags me down.

Any advice is appreciated."

At the age of 13 i became really depressed because of some times in my childhood when i used to get rejected by some of the other kids and that kind of pushed me into becoming an introvert i think... When i was 14 i considered suicide and almost went through with it but thankfully i drank a bit before i wanted to ""do it"" and felt numb enough to not give a shit... But that feeling also made me decide to continue eitherway and if it didnt get any better in a years time i would try again... Things did get better and alcohol did make me open up to more people and made me realise i wasn't the only one eith such problems.im 15 now and i still drink, if any of you have been in a similar situation in the past it would really help if you could give me some advice on how you handled the situation"

alcoholism,,"I did a very hard thing today Iâ€™m 22, and until September of this past year, I had a pretty good relationship with my father. 

Now Iâ€™m not an idiot and have been well aware of his occasional blackouts, as at times I have witnessed and attempted to control them. 

What I was not aware of, was that he had been sexually abusing my 18 year old sister for years now during these blackouts. 

He claims he has never consciously thought of or done anything of the sexual nature to my sister, and I believe him. I think my whole family (me, mom, sister, and 15 y/o brother) believes him. 

The issue of course is not the intent, but the act itself. And for that reason he has not been allowed in the house nor has he been able to see any of us face-to-face. 

My whole life I have been trying to get him to stop drinking. It made him loud and hard to deal with and I noticed this since I was a kid. 

Since I last saw him, I have been texting him every now and again just to let him know that I am thinking of him. 

In the midst of these short exchanges, Iâ€™ve been building up the courage to deliver the following ultimatum:

Quit drinking, or I cut you off. 

Forever. 

Today, I put it out there with him.

I am feeling more powerful about this than I ever have about anything."
alcoholism,,"I'm in my 5 years of recovery but I have relapsed every year I did try to I've been into detox and everything nothing seems to work, My girlfriend of 3 years have seem to lost hope on me, my family too. I dont know what to do. Heya, by the time im writing this I am currently buzzed by alcohol, but yeah as the title suggests. I have been through every outpatient method that I could think of. I have been with valiums,  quetiapines, and other anti psychotic, anti-drinking drugs that my Doctors have given me.  It didn't work. I have been 5 years in this hellhole yet I keep going back to my tendencies of drinking.   


Yes before you ask I have tried multiple times of hanging myself yet I couldnt do it. The scars have healed now around my neck. I've graduated College with a degree in Political Science, I am currently studying Law in my country. Before I came into law It was great the medication was working, everything was great until I failed a subject or two then it all became downhill from there. I want to stop this hellish nightmare of mine.   


Oh before you ask me, I never attended any therapy for this only a doctor. my parents didnt allow me back then because ""It would ruin their reputation within their families"" if it ever comes out that I am an alcoholic.   


There are numerous factors for my alcoholism. First is my first ex-gf didnt gave me closure and her family treated me like shit. 2nd was my family was battling my brother who is now esteemed af in the family because he recovered for some reason which is good for him and he now has a child. 3rd was to fill a gaping hole in myself in my recovery days when my ex broke up with me which started the whole alcohol stuff also the smoking cigarettes.   


My girlfriend and I just had a fight on my condition, she's a psych major which she understood my condition for 3 years until just now. Where I had to constantly lie to her that I was not drinking. Which is a fault on my part tbh. Then she got fed up, I am in a sinking hole atm. On which I may or may not recover on.   


Also note: I have never been part of the AA of my country because my parents being boomers dont like the idea of it of me becoming a part of it so I had to deal with a Psychiatrist only. not with the people I can relate to I guess. Also, I have been detoxed so many times that I feel like I am a burden to my family in which I have planned and did many suicide attempts on which have failed. Its not like in america here where I could buy a gun and kill myself.   


I tried so hard but didnt got so far. (Linkin Park Reference lmao) its been 5 years now I don't know where to go anymore. My gf hates me for lying to her so many times (which I understand) my family who gives a fuck but doesnt understand what Im going through even though the doctors explained to them what im going through. And my Brother who I love so much is trying to bury that his actions before (he was an alcoholic too and recovered by his own will) is trying to deny that Im not an alcoholic by his means. (tbh he was a father figure to me because my dad wasnt around home all the the time). So yeah. I dont know what the fuck am I suppose to do anymore.

alcoholism,,"Am I alcoholic? So a lot of people are in denial of their alcoholism. To me that is the exact opposite : I always knew I had a problem with alcohol and accepted it, until I recently wondered...do I really?

I started drinking on an almost daily basis when I moved to Belgium for my studies something like 8 years ago ( I guess that's part of the culture there ). I'm rarely very drunk as I'm resistant but I'm tipsy almost every evening. I never drunk before 6pm, and if I have a bit more work to do usually not before 8pm. I never ever drink during the day.

But I drink everyday and I thought surely that's a problematic consumption? Up until recently I had to move for a week in a alternative school where they're fine with guest consuming alcohol but it's just not in their customs to drink themselves. I could have bought some and continue drinking but I was like...no, let's stop for a week to see what happens. 

And what happened was....nothing. absolutely nothing.  Did not crave it , didn't feel anything about it. I was feeling a bit more awake in the morning and that's all. So u started reading this sub and other alcohol related one's on Reddit. I do not recognize myself in the stories shared here. At all. I mean, did I often get in fights because of alcohol? Not. Not often,  not ever. Alcohol does not make me a tiny bit violent.  Does it ruins my sentimental life? No. Actually I'm mostly meeting girls in bars as my work involve working alone so I would say it's actually helping it. Do I get myself in embarassi g situation because of it? It happened at some point in my life , like anyone else. But I can't remember the last time. Not once in the past 5 to 8 years for sure. Maybe it's linked to my anxiety or the fact I'm slightly overweight but hard to say because I've always been anxious and slightly overweight,  which have been living ked by my doctors to other things I won't discus here. 

Sooooo. Yeah.  I always thought I had a problematic consumption because I'm drinking almost everyday and I've been told that's what a problematic consumption is. But actually now that I'm thinking about it....do I really have a problem with alcohol?"
alcoholism,,"I agreed to marry an alcoholic only to realize I don't want to marry an alcoholic. I'm overwhelmed with my fiancÃ©'s alcoholism and don't know what step I can take in order for him to take action.

I'm more so seeking advice from someone on his end of things so I can figure out how to approach him without it turning into a fight. 

How were you emotionally reached when a loved one needed to share their concerns about your drinking? 

I'm considering taking a ""break"" with the condition that if he doesn't take this seriously this time then I won't be coming back. (Though this scenario has happened multiple times without my full commitment either cause, y'kno, codependency)

My heart is so torn. I want my love for him to be unconditional. I can't help but feel terribly guilty to have to leave him over this when I want to be his support.. to be there to help him get through this and yet it seems like I can do nothing right.

He refuses to go to AA. But he also said that the way I approached him about going was really wrong.. so what is the best way to approach that conversation?? What was it that lead you to going to your first meeting? Is getting sober something someone can fully do on their own without AA meetings? Or does that mostly depend on the individuals will power/determination? I must admit I have a hard time wrapping my head around his thought process.  Really need some insight.

alcoholism,,"Advice? I don't know how to talk to my mom about her drinking.

Background - a bunch of really crappy stuff has been happening to my mom the last couple of years, causing her to spiral into depression and alcohol abuse, culminating in her her being hospitalized for suicidally and an attempt twice this last year, her not taking to me for the six months between the two hospitalizations and her being homeless for part of that time. Prior to this year, she hasn't had major issues, we've always been really close. After her hospitalization and attempt she contacted me again and apologized for pushing me away. She's been living on my couch for about 7 months now. She has no job and no savings. We have no family. 

Most of this time she's been good - not drinking (at least that I could tell) I was trying to get her to seek active treatment but she doesn't have insurance, doesn't want meditation, and actively lied to and manipulates her therapists/doctors in the hospital to get released she admitted - and this expressed a derision to talk to someone. I've tried to encourage her to try to seek help however suits her - whether she wants to try mindfulness based relapse prevention or if she wants to try to volunteer somewhere to get her doing something.  I didn't press it because it seemed like she was doing better - I guess I just really wanted to believe it. Hoped she'd realize it with some space.

Thursday afternoon she was sleeping at the wrong time when I got home. She's been actively drunk or asleep since then.  She has:

1) fallen over. Repeatedly.
2) tried to use the bathroom in our closet. Twice.
3) not been able to form coherent sentences at times
4) yelled, screamed, cried, repeated phrases over and over, jumped topics, etc
3) gotten convinced that a maintenance guy outside was trying to kill her, screamed at him, then hid and cried

She literally can't follow a conversation now and I can't sleep. She's stubborn and so so angry right now. I'm trying to wait until she's sober enough to impress that I cannot do this. But she has nothing else and will probably die/kill herself if she's put in the street. I'm worried she's going to get the cops called on her or I'll get kicked out of my house when someone complains.  Hospital doesn't seem to help because they can't hold her long enough to get through and she's intelligent enough to fake it when even pretty drunk.

I guess I'm asking for any tips for how to talk to her without just kicking her out?
Magic anyone?
I know it has to come from her, but how do I encourage this?

Note - yes I will be talking to a professional to support me, but while I wait for regular business hours..."

I'm 17 and don't drink. But most of my school colleagues do(of 50 in my class, 42 drink). Almost all of them are heavy drinkers. As far as I know, most of them started drinking 2 years ago. They drink twice in the weekend and once or twice during the week. And they drink heavily. Generally until some among them starts blacking out.

Would this qualify them as alcoholics?
I suppose it is not easy to know when someone is an alchoholic, but is it possible or probable that they are?

How should I deal with them?
Generally when I meet them, they are sober. I don't speak with them very much, for almost all of them that were my friends stopped being when they started to drink. I still worry for them, however. How should I deal with them generally? Is there something I could do to try to change something on them to the better?Treatment is out of question, for they have not yet felt the bad permanent effects of alcohol and they keep it secret from their parents.

Would you recomend that someone don't start to drink?

Thanks in advance."
alcoholism,,"How do I even begin? Iâ€™ve struggled with alcohol for years. I am not a drink every day person, but when I socialize I always feel like I need a drink and am prone to overdoing it and blacking out. 

Last night was bad. Iâ€™ve learned that having a â€œbig night outâ€ or going into â€œparty modeâ€ are triggers for me. I drank way too much, blacked out, and did quite a lot of harmful embarrassing things. I feel so done with this. Done with the shame, the self hatred, the embarrassment, the ruining of relationships, etc. I absolutely must stop because I will ruin my life and I will ruin important relationships.

I feel like I need advice from people who have been there. I feel so lost and need to talk about it. I think the problem stems from anxiety, liking the â€œdrunk meâ€ more because sheâ€™s more sociable, boredom, and the lack of an â€œoff switch.â€ How do I even start?

I'm 26 and married (for now at least). 

I've been dating my now wife for about 10 years now. About a year ago I became addicted to alcohol. A short time after that I started compulsively lying about everything, big or small. From getting promotions at work, to being in a car accident, to what time I would come home from work. 

I recently got discovered, and naturally my wife is furious. 

I'm going to my first AA meeting later tonight, and I'm starting therapy that specializes in sexual abuse later this week. 

The worst part is that I feel very little emotion or remorse. I don't know if I'm in shock or just apathetic and depressed. But it's really hard for me feel right now. And that makes me want to drink again and end my massive 12 hours of sobriety already. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this here other than are there others that feel this way? Is this normal with alcoholism? For others struggling with something like this, how did you cope?"
alcoholism,,"What do do about my fathers worsening alcohol induced behaviour. My father is a chronic alcoholic and has begun to show increased aggression and some potential signs of alcoholic dementia. I have serious concerns that he could harm himself or someone else. My mother has already left him due to his constant verbal abuse and now my sister is baring the brunt of his behaviour. 

He is always screaming and shouting and my sisters older son has started saying that he doesn't like his grandpa. We have not long found out that he has definitely been drink driving when he has had my sister and her children in the car and that he has stolen alcohol from other peoples houses when visiting. He has also recently completely lost all control and threw things at my sister whilst she was holding her baby but fortunately she managed to turn so that nothing hit him.

She doesn't have anywhere else to live and she is scared that if she does eventually move out that father will kill himself but she is also terrified that if she calls the police that social services would get involved. After the most recent bout of bad behaviour, mother and I are concerned about the safety of my sister and her children. We tried to speak to his doctor but he cannot take a verbal report of this.

We are at a loss of what to do. If we call the police all hell would break loose, although in the long run it might do some good. I've also been considering writing a letter detailing fathers behaviour and addressing it to his doctor in the hope that he might be able to do something, although I'm not entirely sure that it would come to anything.

My family are at their wits end and we don't know what to do. Anything we've thought of would definitely cause father to go ballistic although I've reached the point where I would do it and take full responsibility and make sure that father knows that I'm to blame. 

Currently he is spending over Â£100 a week on alcohol and has got into serious debt because of it. He needs help but won't even listen if anyone makes even the slightest mention of him having an issue with drink. I know that mother is trying to convince my sister to go to the council and see if she can get emergency accommodation.

I managed to get a lot of things about alcohol dependance memorized along with mapping out her consumption in magnitude of ways. 

It ended with me studying up on liver sirrhosis and running down a number of different studies and articles about it. I ran her and her consumption through all of it and it's... not good. I found a way to get her to go to rehab, except at the cost of having to break the news that her liver could shut down at any moment. 

At first during the conversation when I was running down some numbers, she said ""Alright, I'll cut down on my drinking."" and it ended up with her having a panic attack, needing to lay down, almost vomiting, silently crying, and agreeing that the only option is detox and rehab.

I'm currently in graduate school, so I will be in and out of my place quite often. I hardly drink, and I quit any and all drug use a couple of years ago, so maintaining a ""substance"" free apartment won't be difficult at all.

Iâ€™ve had to disconnect myself from his choices because itâ€™s hurt so much over the years when heâ€™s chosen to drink, not come home, hurt himself, hurt others, verbally abuse me, etc. 

Heâ€™s finally asleep. He came home at 3:30 am telling me he needed to report his Uber driver and that he shouldnâ€™t be as fucked up as he is. I was scared that he got drugged - turned out he wasnâ€™t - just extremely drunk. 

He eventually started screaming at me about how fucked up the world is and getting angry (he calls it raging) about how no one gives a fuck and wants to help end all of the suffering. He kept saying â€œI canâ€™t do thisâ€ over and over. He wouldnâ€™t let me touch him. He has two guns in our bedroom and I had 911 ready to go because I was scared he was going to make a move for the one in the dresser drawer. 

After yelling at me and my part in all of this, he looked up Jeff Bezosâ€™ net worth and freaked out about how he could be helping so many people with his money and how heâ€™s angry that no one gives a fuck. He yelled at me that Iâ€™m the problem and that phones are the problem and then THREW his phone so hard at our bedroom wall that itâ€™s completely ruined and the wall is damaged. 

I yawned (itâ€™s 4:30 am now) and he got upset because to him it was a signal that Iâ€™m uninterested. He went to bed. 

Iâ€™m downstairs on the couch. I love him so much but heâ€™s got so many issues that he doesnâ€™t work on or try to resolve. Iâ€™m scared right now. I donâ€™t know how to leave - and Iâ€™m scared that he will go off the deep end with drinking and in the state heâ€™s in - hurt himself. 

I didnâ€™t know where to put this. I needed to talk to someone but itâ€™s 5 am where I am.

Iâ€™m sober. He keeps drinking even though he promises heâ€™ll stop. I understand how that goes. Heâ€™s not jeopardizing my recovery - thereâ€™s no alcohol in the house/he knows better than to drink around me. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Heâ€™s a good person when heâ€™s sober, but he doesnâ€™t do anything to help the world that aligns with his misguided anger. He wonâ€™t talk to anyone. â€œTherapy and groups are all bullshitâ€. Fuck the world mentality. Heâ€™s in a dangerous place to be alone but he wonâ€™t let anyone in - and I canâ€™t do it anymore.

I'm not a specialist, so I don't know anything about it, but the things she said to me are so strange. For example: she screamed I am not save and people want to harm me. Also she thinks she's going to die.   


I'm so worried and at the same time I also feel anger towards her, because of those aggressive outbursts."
alcoholism,,"Naltrexone and other meds So I am an alcoholic, 10-12 beers a day, every day for many years.  Over the past two months I have cut my drinking down to 2-3 times per week, but still put away 10-12 beers per session.  In the last 2 weeks, I have drank 3 times, and as of this post, have not had a drink in 4 days.  

My doctor prescribed me Naltrexone, 50mg, and I've taken it once.  That one time, I took it with several other meds and I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and I think I was hallucinating.  Everything looked fuzzy, almost like the A-Ha video for Take on Me.  

Is this a side effect of the Naltrexone or the combo of scripts I took?  I've been taking meds for anxiety and a pinched nerve in my back, but have never had the above experience before until I took the Naltrexone with the rest of my meds.  My pharmacist said I could take Naltrexone with the other meds and it would just increase drowsiness, but I was not expecting hallucinations.

I see posts and such on people getting really sick due to withdrawals, is the Naltrexone going to prevent this, or is it strictly to help me stay away from alcohol?

Sorry for the rant, but I'm at a point in my battle where this is the longest I've gone without a drink, and don't know how things are going to go moving forward.

Thanks!"
alcoholism,,"My final day 1. This is it. My girlfriend and soulmate is about to leave me, and I'm definitely going to die soon if I don't quit immediately. No more slipups. No more acting like it's a game. No more ""well I told myself just 2 beers and couldn't stop until 20...""

I'm sick of the the broken promises of stopping. I've had so many day 1s.... but this is it. There are two paths I can choose. I can have a chance at a happy future with my soulmate, or I can die young, possibly in a few years. A horrible death.

alcoholism,,"Drinking is sucking my life out My husband was sober for 6 years. He started drinking again about a year ago. To be honest, when he first started drinking again it was somewhat of a relief. I am usually an occasional drinker and when I drank with family occasionally (once every couple months) he wasnâ€™t happy. He didnâ€™t express that my drinking affected him, in fact it was the opposite. He claimed that he was happy that I was doing what I wanted and proud that he didnâ€™t care about drinking. That being said he always had an attitude when I came home after a night having drinks with my family. I always felt so bad. He isnâ€™t a communicator as wasnâ€™t interested in discussing his feelings. SO when he started drinking again it was nice. We were able to share something and have fun while having a few drinks. The fun didnâ€™t last. Since he started drinking again I have been drinking more and it really sucks. This is making a long story short. I miss our old life but my husband is a grown ass man and I am not about to give him an ultimatum. 

There is more to be said for sure. I am struggling and I am tired of spending time, money and emotions on alcohol. What a damn waste!"

I made the choice of sobriety on a hungover plane ride to Texas, where Iâ€™m at till the end of this month, then Iâ€™ll head back to California and start another chapter. Iâ€™ve spent the majority of my time in Texas in a state of complete isolation. I go to my class that Iâ€™m attending, I eat alone, I go to the gym alone, I go to the hotel room and sit inside it alone. Listening to music or writing or reading. But this isolation is eating me alive. I know if I make an attempt to go out Iâ€™ll probably drink, so Iâ€™m forcing myself to be reclusive. A means to an end perhaps...Iâ€™m not even sure if I know whatâ€™s best or not. For a year I was barely in my body, I was just trying to drown everything away.

It's so easy to do, what I can't seem to do is not do it.

I'm even playing board games online in a voice chat with friends on the nights I'm drinking.

alcoholism,,"Make it real Hi, posting on here as writing this almost makes it more accountable. Today is day 3 of trying to give up for 3 months. I have always used alcohol as a constant in my life as at times itâ€™s felt like the only thing that has been there, saying that sounds so sad. I have amazing people around me and I want to give up for them aslweel as myself.  

People say itâ€™s the devil and it really is...anything bad that has ever happens to me has always been because of it.  And yet I have never been able to give it up. There is always something that makes me drink again and again.  In a strange way the thought of not drinking seems like a scary prospect as Iv never been sober in certain social situations.

Good luck to anyone else trying to give up."

Now, on days where I am feeling emotional, everything doesn't seem like a dark hole. I feel like I can healthily sit with my emotions and anxiety now. 
3. My brain feels way sharper. I didn't realize how much of a fog I was in a lot of the time. I was also consistently asking to work from home and loosing motivation, so I feel ambitious again.

alcoholism,,"Am I going through withdrawal? Hi everyone

I recently started the Keto diet and, although not necessary, decided to go the extra mile and completely cut out drinking. Partly because most alcoholic drinks are ripe with carbs, but also because I feel it's been an unspoken problem in my life for too long.
My alcohol use has been a sliding scale but I would say for the last few months my average week included one or two days of heavy drinking, 3 or 4 days of drinking a couple to sleep, and maybe once a week where I didn't drink at all.

I started keto two weeks ago and haven't had a drop of alcohol the whole time. I deal with pretty crippling anxiety and depression on a regular basis but this last week has been ABSOLUTE HELL. This is the worst I've ever felt mentally.
The reason I'm not sure if it's withdrawal is because 1) every website and every person says days 7-10 are the worst and it gets better, but I'm sitting on day 15 wanting to die. 2) I'm not really experiencing the other general signs. I'm a tad shakey, but I always am. I'm a bit more irritable than usual, but that's probably a direct result of increased anxiety. Beyond that, I've exhibited absolutely no physical signs of alcohol withdrawal.
It could be the diet, it could be the immediate decrease in alcohol. It could be a million other things or none at all. Sometimes mental illnesses just get worse for no reason. 
I guess I'm just hoping someone has an answer because experiencing this is just making me want to go back to drinking even more."
alcoholism,,"Attempting Medical Alcohol Detox I went to see a counsler and did a 3 hour assessment she advised me the safest way to quit drinking is to go through a medical assisted detox. I've been drinking 12 to 15 beers a day for about 5 years. She referred me to go to a hospital where they would facilitate that.

I went to the hospital and got checked in at the ER. They took my vitals and my blood sample and said since my ethonal level was low enough they would send me right upstairs to the detow room. (The whole process took 4 hours. Totally understandable on a sunday)

I got sent upstairs to what I thought was going to be the detox center that I would spend a few days to be supervised during the physical whithdwaral symptoms.


I was questioned if I had shakes which I did not
 I was asked when my last drink was which was the night before at 10 (this was about 6 the next day) then I was asked to take a breathalyzer to which I
 blew a 0.0. They then explained that I did not meet the criteria for medical withdrawal and I was recommended for outpatient treatment. I explained that my counselor who was part of this program told me to come here. I drove an hour from home to do this. I asked to speak to a doctor and was told that there was no doctor there (again understandable at 6pm on a sunday) Then right before I was about to leave they said I could stay the night and figure it out in the morning.

I felt uncomfortable and left. I contacted my counselor the next day and  I'm meeting with her tomorrow.  It was very upsetting because it was really difficult to go through the process to get help and end up feeling like no one cared.

 I also feel like when they told me I could stay the night maybe I should have. I was prepared to spend a few days I had my iPad a bunch of music I wanted to listened to. Figured it would suck pretty bad but I would keep myself busy. When they were going to admit me the told me I had to leave all my clothes and all of my things and I could get quarters for if I had to use the pay phone. All my stuff had to be locked up until I left. What the hell was I going to do for 3 days?  

No one at the recovery program I am in told me what to expect and what the process looks like. Thought I'd share my experience. It was really difficult for me and my girlfriend who came with me to go through all of that just for me to end up at home. I took 2 weeks off work to get clean. This is my first experience trying to get help. Hopefully my counselor can help my tomorrow. Sorry for the long post just wanted to share my experience.

In highschool I never really had many friends which at the time i was fine with but after dating this girl who was very possessive I felt like I wanted friends. She helped me get a job where I could have friends and then i started hanging out with sed friends and mostly all they did was drink and do shit. She never accepted them because we never smoked or drank when we were together so she saw it as something bad for me. We had been dating 6 or 7 years and in my eyes she was trying to keep me from anyone that wasn't her.

So i broke up with her feeling super trapped. 

I tried to live my life without her and after that finding a boyfriend who wanted to drink all the time. I tried to stop him because I saw it wasn't healthy. But he wouldn't stop. So i kept drinking with him because it was something i couldn't stop. So every day for 10 months i drank with him doing whatever he wanted. 10 months went by and i decided he wasn't good for me. I broke up with him finding out he was already talking to someone else. Trying to get over him was hard as shit but i have been doing so. 

Months later I find a boy who loves me exactly as who i am no matter what but he also likes to drink late at night (which i work early morning he works late at night) so we miss eachpther a lot but he likes to drink whem he gets off to calm down from his shift. 

I love him but (i keep telling him it's fine if he drinks because I don't want to change his daily routines) she (my ex girlfriend) has been the only person who has been checking in and she asks everyday if i have had a drink or not.

Couple of days ago I (25 f) had a work party with a lot of coworkers that I didn't know at all, save a few people I vaguely know as colleagues. We had free drinks and I've mostly drank wine the whole evening. It was a pretty boring party so I thought I just needed a bit of liquid courage to socialize better(others were going at it pretty heavily too). I can handle booze pretty well usually and I've had nights where I've had double the amount and would be heavily tipsy at most. I've had about 6-7 small glasses for as long as my memory still worked. 

Yes, I'm well aware I've been majorly retarded for drinking that amount with people that I don't know very wellI.

 I remember dancing and being fine overal, except being tipsy and all of the sudden everything goes blurry. I vaguely remember the party being over and people went outside. I couldn't walk or feel anything. I've been drunk before, but this was on a whole other level. My vision was a dark tunnel with flashes. Then I think I passed out because I faceplanted for some reason. That's when I blacked out for 2-3 hours. I ""awakened"" in the toilet of my house while my boyfriend was frantically taking care of me. Apparently I just stormed in at 2 am and ran to the bathroom. The fall had left me with cuts and bruises on my face and my shoulder hurt like hell. I then was in a pained daze on the bathroom floor unable to move while puking my guts out repeatedly. I don't remember how I got home. There's at least an hour between the end of the party and when I got home and I don't remember! I've never experienced this before. Never got shitfaced to this degree with a blackout. Maybe I've just been foolish and there's another explanation. But the way this all went down is extremely weird to me. I've felt sick for days and I'm afraid to ask colleagues, as I'm afraid for the answer. Aside from being mightily embarrassed, I'm also worried I've been taken advantage of. There's no obvious suspect and maybe nothing happened, but I can't help but speculate te possibility since there's a hole in my memory that I can't fill. Which is what scares me most. 

Only thing I could find is it possibly being GHB, which is pretty popular in this area. I don't want to accuse or point fingers. I just want to know if what I described is my own stupidity or if someone tampered with my drink. I'm hoping it's just me being a moron and I can leave this behind me with a lesson learned, but I suspect differently. So at long last. Does any of you know more about this subject?

alcoholism,,"Are you a survivor of mental illness and/or suicide? (ignore if this doesn't fit the sub) Hey yall,

I'd love to get your thoughts on a mental health awareness campaign I've been working on for the past year. If you're interested in participating, even better.

**WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?**

***The news is killing people.***

When we lost Robin Williams the suicide rate increased by 10%. Marilyn Monroe: 12%. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, the hotline got 25% more calls. It's called *suicide contagion,* and itâ€™s the proven link between mass media coverage of suicide and an increase in suicide rates.

Think about it. If a celebrity with more resources and success couldnâ€™t beat it, how can anyone? It makes you feel hopeless. And hopelessness can be deadly.

With suicide rates increasing across the world, we have to do something now more than ever. Something unprecedented. We have to tell the other side of the story. Where people survive and thrive. We have to #ReportSurvival.

***#ReportSurvival***

\#ReportSurvival is a campaign guiding news organizations to report suicide more responsibly. Whether itâ€™s Buzzfeed, the local news, or CNN, weâ€™ll create a media landscape where a story of someone who survived suicide follows every report of someone who didn't.

**WHY SURVIVOR STORIES?**

***Why survivor stories?***

For every person that dies by suicide, another 280 people survive. Many of whom go on to live happy, fulfilling lives. These stories of survival and perseverance hold extraordinary power. That's why they're an effective way to end suicide contagion. But don't take it from us, take it from them:

â€œPortraying suicide survivors rather than focusing on completed cases in the media is more effective in reducing suicide contagion.â€

* *Madelyn Gould, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University and expert in youth suicide*

â€œOur best answers as to why suicides happen and what we can do to prevent them are not found by focusing on the one person who died by suicide, but by focusing on the livingâ€”the other 280 who survived.â€

* *John Draper, Ph.D., executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline*

â€œIt turns out that, although suicide can be contagious, resilience can also be contagious. And when we look at media reports that talk about people who thought about suicide but instead got help and got better, that actually rates across the population, the number of deaths that happen in a specific area, go down. And we really really want to encourage people to report in that kind of way.â€

* *Mark Sinyor, M.D., Clinical Researcher and Professor at the University of Toronto*

â€œHearing stories from people who have survived suicide attempts is an important step in suicide prevention.â€

* *Professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the Year for his services to youth mental health*

â€œTheir stories are not only enlightening professionals who create policies or study the subject, but they are also transmitting all important hope to those at risk.""

* *Center for Suicide Prevention*

""People see stories all the time about those surviving breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and we know what that recovery looks likeâ€”it helps people who are experiencing it or someone whose mom just got diagnosed. So many people go through their suicidal crisis feeling completely isolated and alone because they think they're the only ones. But they're not. There are millions of healing and recovery storiesâ€”they just haven't been shared.""

* *Shelby Rowe, a youth suicide prevention program manager for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services*

***Donâ€™t survivor stories already exist?***

When was the last time you saw an uplifting news story about someone who overcame suicide? Unfortunately, itâ€™s human nature to take an interest in conflict, drama, and tragedy. As a result, the few survivor stories that are independently produced are unpromoted and low quality.

Of the content that does exist, ours will be different in several crucial ways:

1. ***Relevance*** \- Instead of one or two, weâ€™ll feature 20 unique stories. This ensures every sufferer, no matter their experience, has something they can relate to.
2. ***Quality*** \- Weâ€™ve worked with award-winning production companies, many of whom are interested in pro-bono work. That means weâ€™ll have the best equipment, crews, and directors to deliver quality films that distinguish our stories and engage our viewers.
3. ***Compelling Content*** \- Weâ€™ve learned storytelling at some of the worldâ€™s most renown advertising agencies and news organizations. Given our experience, weâ€™re confident we can create films that are enthralling, concise, and effective.
4. ***Understanding*** *â€“* We understand these issues because weâ€™ve been victims of them. Whether itâ€™s suicide, suicide contagion, or depression, the videos weâ€™re creating are films we wish existed when we felt lost and hopeless.
5. ***Casting*** \- Finding the right people is essential. Without a good story, we donâ€™t have a film worth making. Thatâ€™s why we wonâ€™t proceed until weâ€™re completely satisfied.
6. ***Link to Treatment*** \- This is about more than hope. Itâ€™s about action and lasting change. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re putting emphasis on how suicide survivors got through it, giving concrete examples of how others can too. Each film will link to treatment options and affordable resources to help people take the next step and get the help they so desperately need.

**HOW WILL THIS WORK?**

For this to work, we need news organizations to see these survivor stories and make a commitment to #ReportSurvival. Hereâ€™s why it will happen:

1. ***Itâ€™s nothing new:*** Media guidelines for how to report suicide already exist. The most effective being the suicide prevention hotline. Problem is, suicide contagion is only getting worse. This makes #ReportSurvival a simple, yet essential evolution of these guidelines.
2. ***We made it simple:*** We'll make the survivor films ourselves. All theyâ€™ll have to do is link to the film. That's one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. Itâ€™s that easy.
3. ***Broadcast quality:*** Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.
4. ***Variety:*** With 20 different films, news outlets wonâ€™t have to worry about covering the same story.
5. ***Pre-launch partnership:*** Weâ€™ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they'll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.
6. ***PR:*** A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations wonâ€™t miss our efforts.
7. ***Legitimacy:*** Along the way, we'll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.
8. ***They already care:*** Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue theyâ€™re painfully aware of.

With that, letâ€™s go over how this works executionally.

1. ***Pre-Launch: The Stories***

***Casting***

First things first. Weâ€™ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, weâ€™ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.

***Production***

To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we'll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people whoâ€™re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.

***Partnerships***

The more help we can get the better. Whether itâ€™s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, weâ€™ll take whatever we can get.

2) ***Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival***

***Influencers***

Although itâ€™s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obamaâ€™s â€œChangeâ€ campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.

Given this issue's importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the worldâ€™s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.

***Bring on the News***

As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, weâ€™ll partner with an organization beforehand.

3) ***Launch***

***Wait for it***

Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, weâ€™ll turn awareness into action.

**WHO ARE WE?**

***Iâ€™m Tim***

I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy &amp; Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.

I know what it's like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.

Thatâ€™s why this isnâ€™t something I *want* to do. This is something I *will do*.

***The Agency***

My digital media company GUSH specializes in social media campaigns and PR-worthy executions. Part of our business is applying our digital, social, and PR skills to end the mental health crisis.

**DO YOU HAVE A STORY?**

We'd love to hear and potentially feature it to help launch the project!"

alcoholism,,"Concern Someone I love has been showing signs of (what I feel is) unhealthy alcohol habits. Drinking every evening and drinking in bed by themselves. They are starting to even do it in secret. I talked with them about possibly creating drinking rules (only drinking on weekends, and never drinking alone, or even giving up drinking completely for a month or so)... But I am still scared that it will just keep getting worse. They seemed willing to agree to these rules... But, it is a lot easier to agree not to drink, until you are faced with a situation like a party or gathering where alcohol is offered freely or even given to you without asking if you want it... You know? 

I am just scared. I don't want it to get so far that it becomes a real issue, and turns into a real addiction.

I have no experience with anything like this and wanted to reach out for advice from people who do."

I have done some really stupid stuff whilst under the influence and I don't wanna end up getting locked up,beaten up or killed just cos I was too drunk to know what the fuck I was doing.
Last night was a total disaster,I play in a band and I single handedly managed to mess up an entire gig because I drank myself into oblivion and took some speed. Now I feel like every one fucking hates me and it's horrible cos I don't even know what i did exactly. I just hope I don't lose any friends over this because I've promised them that I'll stop getting wrecked before we play. 
I'm gonna try n go a month without drinking and see how I feel cos I'm sick of it and it's depressing me,especially after last night. I could just curl up and die with shame and embarrassment ,I'm scared to check my messages incase it's bad news and I just want to shut myself away for a month and try to sort myself out....I smoke a lot of weed too but I need to try n cut that out for a while as well."

My wife, gf at the time started to push me to go to AA and seek help. I would go once or twice, maybe go a day or two with out drinking, but always fall back to it.  In the last couple years I began to hide it from her, which meant I also switched to vodka and other hard drinks to hide it easier. 
     I've also battled mental health issues most of my childhood, but stop taking meds right before I started drinking. No surprise I found alcohol at that point. 
About 3 days ago I stopped drinking after a hard 3 day bender. The last day I had something happen that brought up a lot of anxiety about my past. My younger years arent full of things that I'm regretful of, but there definitely are some events that haunt me. Long story short I have slept about 5 hours(in about 20max at a time) since Thursday(it is 4:42pm sat). I've been in a constant state of high anxiety and been through about 40 heavy panic attacks. I've opened up to my wife about things that are haunting me, and the drinking I've been hiding. We have decided to move into her parents house, and out of our rented house who we share with another heavy alcoholic. 
Last night I shot awake in another panic attack but had self harm thought, so I woke my wife and we went to the ER right away. Now I have a psych evaluation on Monday, and I'm not going to be left alone till then.

alcoholism,,"Young alcohol dependant people, what is your story. Hi there! I have noticed that a lot of the people writing stories here are pretty young, i always imagined an alcohol addiction to be something for older people, or at least middle aged. A lot of the posts i see in this subreddit are from people between the age of 19 and 25.

I'm 21 years old myself and i'm from the Netherlands (where the minimum drinking age is 18), i have been dependant on alcohol for about 2 years now, as a result of a mental disorder, it started when i was 16 and i smoked my first joint. After having a lot of severe panic attacks after smoking weed, i woke up the next day in a dream-like state which, after googling a lot, i called DPDR (depersonalisation derealisation disorder). Even though i don't really feel like living in a dream anymore, i still have a lot of difficulty with sleeping.

I get panic attacks when i'm sober and trying to sleep and i just get stressed about the thought of not being able to sleep, which makes me not able to sleep. I'm going to see a psychologist in a few days and i'm trying to reduce the amount of alcohol that i consume every day (i drink every day).

Or stinging feeling in my knees and ankles and very mildly in my elbows. I hadnt done any heavy lifting or anything the night before while drinking (the bachelorette party was at a movie theater) so I wasnt dancing or anything. ANYWAY. It went away after about 2 days but it was so painful I was worried I wouldnt even be able to stand... it felt like my knees had been beaten with a bat! 

Anyway yesterday and the day before I drank 2 days in a row for the first time in a while and now again today I have the tight, creaking, burning sharp joint pain in my knees an ankles! Has anyone else ever experienced this? Its only happened to me once before a looong time ago when I had too much tequila (its been dubbed ""bone hurt juice"" since then) its not like the pain is bad enough to see a doctor or anything it just feels like my joints are extremely tight or like about to crack"

alcoholism,,"Question about where I'm heading alcoholism runs through my mom's side of the family, and i am currently 19, started drinking at 16. i realized quickly off the bat that alcohol and me were made for each other. any social event i'd attend i'd go straight for the alcohol, just to calm myself down and give myself that euphoric bliss. i would drink maybe twice a month with friends, but i always take it a step further than the rest of my friends.  recently i've noticed i don't get that warm euphoria from drinking, and it feels like i'm chasing something i won't get, and then i black out. i feel like my tolerance is increasing even though i've only drank two days in a row like twice my whole life.

i'm currently starting antidepressants and have decided to take an extended hiatus from drinking, but i'm thinking of giving it up for good because i'm honestly kinda scared. when i start drinking i can't stop until all the alcohol is gone. drinking only 2 beers leaves me with this uncomfortable itch i feel can only be solved by drinking more. i would love to be that guy that can walk into a room with a 30 pack of beer, drink 2 throughout the night and leave buzzed while still having had a great time, but i don't know if that's possible for me.  like my mind thinks ""there's so much beer left, drink 6 and you'll be happier and more outgoing"". what do you guys think? should i stop for good? is there a way to control my binge drinking habits? i'd really like to be able to drink beers with my friends when i'm 33 and not be dependent on it. i've told myself i'll never drink by myself again. i know i have an alcohol problem, but is it fixable by anything other than sobriety?"

I wouldnâ€™t consider myself an alcoholic, at least not yet. But I think Iâ€™m getting there and Iâ€™m not sure what to do about it. 

I donâ€™t drink every day or even super often. But the dependency is whatâ€™s there. I have a very addictive personality and smoke, have been dependent on many medications etc. And have drank a few times when I was younger, and now that Iâ€™m older itâ€™s only gotten worse. 

At this point I donâ€™t know what to consider myself. I donâ€™t drink every day, but I want too, if I could drink every day I would. When I get drunk, I never want to be sober again, I cry and feel depressed when sobering up because I donâ€™t wanna be sober. If we have booze in the house, Iâ€™ll try and steal it. If I have extra money, I wanna buy booze. If thereâ€™s booze in the house Iâ€™ll also use any excuse I can to drink and plan my days around when I can drink, I want to be drunk constantly. 

I donâ€™t know what to do... I canâ€™t seem to get myself out of this thinking pattern and I have nowhere to turn because if Iâ€™m not heavily drinking every day I canâ€™t use the resources for alcoholics. So I thought maybe an online community could offer some support and guidance. 

Does it sound like Iâ€™m slipping into alcoholism? How would you get yourself out of this rut? I canâ€™t exactly get therapy or anything, which I need anyways since I have ptsd and a slew of other mental issues. I really donâ€™t know where to turn and Iâ€™m feeling pretty lost and am struggling to not just let myself fall into the pit and start drinking daily.

alcoholism,,"The IPA â€œhobbyâ€ has done me dirty. Iâ€™m a 24 year old dude. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™ve been drinking for about 5 years. Originally, I was drinking crappy beers with my buddies around camp fires a bunch of nights a week during the summer. The summer before we went of to college. 

From that, stemmed an overall interest in beer. That led to the IPAâ€™s. Before I knew it, I was drinking 8% DIPAâ€™s in my dorm alone. A four pack every night. I chalked it up to a â€œhobby.â€ An interest in microbrews such as Lawsons, Alchemist, Trillium, etc. 

That â€œhobbyâ€ just allowed me to get messed up every night. 

Iâ€™m having a hard time shaking the addiction. Itâ€™s not the hobby I thought. I know this, because the mornings following are mostly composed of shaky hands, anxiety, a general feeling of malaise, and just a general feeling that Iâ€™m not myself. 

Iâ€™ll go days without drinking. Generally, about two. The maximum? About five. 

Itâ€™s caused fights with my loved ones. Which always ends with me feeling okay again. With me saying I can drink responsibly for sure.. this time. 

The thing Iâ€™ve noticed, is that Iâ€™m in legitimate pain? I feel pain in my flank. It dissipates with the days after my alcohol use. Perhaps itâ€™s my anxiety, but that scares me. 

Iâ€™m not in control. Itâ€™s time I get in control of my life. I have so much ahead of me, and itâ€™s time I quit numbing myself to it. â€œHobbyâ€ or not."

Well, Iâ€™m 34 now, and Iâ€™ve been drinking a pint of liquor a day for five years (sometimes more, sometime less. Depends on the day.) 
I just fell into this routine of drinking every day after my dinner had settled, and now Iâ€™m wondering if I could be physically addicted at this point. 
My friends and family offer different opinions, with some saying â€œyouâ€™re an alcoholicâ€, while others maintain â€œMuch of the world drinks daily. Even Winston Churchill drank a quart a dayâ€..etc 

My typical choice is vodka, chased with plenty of water. I donâ€™t do mixed drinks that often, and like to keep hydrated when I drink. Iâ€™m just wondering if at this point I *do* have a problem, because the thing is, I donâ€™t want to give up my evening/night liquor, but I also donâ€™t want to suffer seizures or severe withdrawal symptoms if I decided to get completely sober. 

Iâ€™m considering just reducing my intake each night until I can reach a better level of  consumption, as a pint (or more) each night is a bit much, if even taken slow with plenty of water.

My mother used to admit she had a problem when we first discovered she was hiding liquor all over the house. 15 years later, multiple car wrecks (thankfully nobody has gotten hurt but her), forced sobriety/AA meetings which she immediately stops going to once she no longer has to. She makes a complete ass of herself everywhere she goes while drunk, which is almost always. If she gets the ability to drive, she will promise she won't but goes directly to a liquor store. I feel powerless and going to visit on holidays etc is the only leverage I think I still have."
alcoholism,,"I have essentially been on a 10 year long bender. I'm 29. I just want to stop, I'm having a difficult time shutting off the part of my brain that tells me that its ok to drink. I make excuses day in and day out. Oh someone died, let's drink. Someone got married, let's drink. I'm feeling sad, let's drink. I'm feeling happy, bored, excited, lets drink. Oh I had such a shitty last 10 years, lets drink. Don't worry about the fact that the reason that the last 10 years have sucked is because your drinking, just drink.

I have tried AA but in those meetings it is usually other veterans. And we end up talking about war stories. Then I get home, I'm paranoid, I can't sleep. So let's drink...

The longest amount of sobriety I have really had was about 6 months after I tried to kill myself a few years after my deployment and landed in the hospital recovering. Tried that while I was still serving. When I got out of the hospital my squad leader told me that I didn't need to report for duty, 2 weeks later I was standing in front of an LTC and getting my discharge paperwork. Honorable with medical conditions.

Ive been hiding ever since. This was a couple of years ago now. I bought some hiking gear and just disappeared into the mountains. I just keep moving and moving. Ive lived in 3 states in the last 15 months.

I just want to quit drinking. I'm trying. I really feel like I'm trying. Everyday I fight myself, telling myself to just fucking stop it. And I always find an excuse. Oh I haven't slept in 2 days, just fucking drink.

I'm sorry. I don't mean to be so pathetic. I'll probably delete this in a bit. I just needed to reach out for a second and try to stop myself. Try to remind myself that I'm still alive. Take care."

alcoholism,,"wow, kindling? It's been a couple of years since I was drinking every day and rattling when I didn't; the years prior to that were a nightmare of dependency scattershot with a few cold turkeys and medical detoxes, until I ended up in rehab.  Following that, I've binged pretty regularly every two weeks, up until the beginning of this year, where it seems like my drinking has started to escalate and I'm drinking now every five days-ish.  I drank on Friday and this time I'm getting the shakes...last night was pretty bad and I'm still rattling hard this morning, though it's day three so I guess this should be the worst of it.  But I'm a bit perturbed given that I'm not drinking every day that I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Is this due to kindling and how should I be approaching it?  I'm really reluctant to try any kind of tapering as I'm pretty sure this will just lead me back into dependent daily drinking; it only ever escalated the problem in the past."
alcoholism,,"Day zero, starting today. I've decided, no more, i don't want to drink anymore. I've been drinking i think minimum 2 beers  a day, 15 years at least. Occasionally harder stuff, but mostly beer. It hasn't impacted my life too much (so i think), i go to work everyday, haven't skipped a day because of a drink ... but i feel it having a bad effect on my health and mental state. Most i've been without drink has been 2 months , maybe few times total. I don't know how deep i am and how easy or hard it is to get out, but i am gonna try anyway. A few months ago i tried a system where i would drink my 2 beers every third day so 2 days off between drinks. It worked like a month, but eventually, yet again, back to my old pattern. So now i am thinking all or nothing. It's been 10 hours from my last drink, so yeah ..."
alcoholism,,"Sleepwalking, or as I like to call it, drunkwalking So this oneâ€™s a bit personal, but Iâ€™m sure most of us have been there at one point or another. 
Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences before. 

Something used to happen when I drank a lot and Iâ€™ve never known if this is common thing or not.

A few years ago I was going through a pretty bad rough patch, wonâ€™t go into the details but it was some messed up stuff. 
On the nights that I was emotionally distraught, I would drink my normal amount (not actually that much since during that time my tolerance was still building) and eventually would go to bed. 


It was completely different than blacking out.
I remember going to bed, I would usually remember going to sleep too, but ONLY on those nights, I would get back up at some point during the night and I guess sleepwalk. 
When I woke up in the morning I would find that things were knocked over, and almost always a suspicious wet spot on the floor....or in my bed.

I soon realized I had been either urinating on the floor or wetting the bed, and on one occasion, my sister heard me â€œricochetingâ€ down the hall, found me laying on the stairs, tried to wake me up, and just went back to bed after giving up.

Another time I burst into my motherâ€™s room â€œflailing like a fishâ€ and just...didnâ€™t know how to get back out. 

I donâ€™t remember these things, and I always woke up in my bed like normal. Iâ€™d also gotten significantly more drunk on different nights and had nothing of this sort happen at all.

The reason why Iâ€™m so curious is because it has recently been brought to my attention that I have some neurological problems that have apparently been there since my childhood, specifically possible (most likely) seizures.
So a lot of experiences from my past have come to light as being definitely not normal. 
For example blacking out, drug like sensations....

alcoholism,,"Withdrawal Experience (DT's) NIGHTMARE If you have experienced the DT's (aka delirium tremens) you will KNOW it. It is the absolute worst feeling in the world. It is as if you are trapped in your own body panicking, sweating, shaking, facing hallucinations and insomnia. Also my heart beat was so rapid that I was sure I would have a heart attack. Well as a daily vodka drinker for two years, I finally faced the worst state of DT's. I couldn't leave my bed and was hearing / seeing the  most DEMONIC things ever. I tried to detox at home for fear of paying for ER bills, but I just had to check myself into the hospital. When I arrived to the hospital I was even hearing whispers through the ceiling from a demonic presence. When I tell people about my experience of being in the presence of (you know who) it is as if they dont believe me or think it was just a 'hangover' , but this experience was truly terrifying and life-altering. The hallucinations, the whispers.. I truly see it as a spiritual warning which was terrifying. Has anyone else been through this???? What was your experience like?

alcoholism,,"Does the desire to drink ever disappear? I'm trying to quit drinking for the umpteenth time. I've lost count how many. 

I have a question for you successful quitters. Do you still have a desire deep down to drink? For those of you that no longer have the desire, and quit without looking back, how did you get this mentality?

I remember seeing a comment about how this person had taken up running and that had provided them with the necessary stimulation to not look back. 

Personally I find quitting so hard because I'm weak and  I give into my desire. I wish I didn't have the desire.

Iâ€™ve discovered from people thatâ€™s sheâ€™s had this issue before, and sheâ€™s always hateful towards me and never remembers anything the next day. She says things completely opposite of who I am, even her drinking â€œfriendsâ€ say Iâ€™m such a mature young guy and great to her and for her.

I donâ€™t drink much, alcoholism is in my family, not going down that road, I try to get her to the truck and she shoved me out of the way to get another drink.

I don't drink too often which is why I also struggle with this question. I can turn down drinks sometimes but lately its been a bit harder to do so. As soon as I get the first drink in its like I can't stop and I want to continue I drink to get drunk! I'm scared to go out with friends when I know alcohol will be involved.

alcoholism,,"just wanted to share my story/situation I'm 22, female and live in Australia. I have been diagnosed in the last few months (several times by diff psychiatrists) with substance abuse disorder (pertaining just to alcohol, not other drugs), PTSD and BPD. I've been in complete denial about the ""substance use disorder"" diagnosis and was never willing to accept that my drinking was a problem. I even directly told this to the first psychiatrist who diagnosed me. I felt this way because I've been socialising for so long with people who drink heavily (but only socially) multiple times a week, and go on weekend benders. A lot of these people would drink from friday - sunday straight and take dexys to stay up.

Anyway, the thing that I've been in denial about is how physically reliant I feel towards alcohol and how often I drink alone, in the mornings, to avoid cravings. It's recently gotten out of hand and I don't feel remotely in control. I make so many excuses to myself about why it's ok for me to drink in that instance. I know I'm drinking to self medicate my PTSD symptoms. I'm a victim of pretty extreme child sexual abuse which I reported to the police 6\~ ish months ago, and making this reported ""triggered"" me to mentally spiral. I was drinking a lot before I made this report but would rarely drink in the mornings. Lately I've been showing up to work drunk, stealing my housemates' alcohol because I find it impossible to resist the temptation to drink when it's available to me. I can never have just one drink, or even just three. I always end up drinking until I throw up or pass out. 

I had an inpatient stay at a psych hospital for reasons not related to my drinking, and my GP thinks I now need to go back but this time for a detox/rehab program. I know my drinking isn't as bad as other peoples' stories I've read on here but I know it's only getting worse and worse and I'm trying very hard to get it in control before I spiral further. I don't want to go inpatient for my drinking because it would mean my family would know, and I feel very ashamed. I also have a family history of alcoholism on my dad's side and I feel like it would upset him to know I've also been affected by this.

I seriously feel like even though I'm ""functioning"" and doing most daily tasks I'm living a half-life, unable to pursue my interests or feel fully in control of my brain. I'm about to go back to uni this year and at this point I can't imagine successfuly studying while I'm struggling with alcohol so much. I also feel like I'm embarassing myself around other people a huge amount, and ruining my close bonds becauses of how often I forget how I conducted myself in a social situation.

Mostly just seeking general support and wanted to talk to other people about how I'm feeling, because I've been too ashamed to speak with people in real life.

alcoholism,,"My dad is a low key alcoholic This will probably be lengthy so I just want to go ahead and say thank you to anyone who reads this.
My family needs help/advice on what to do.

For the last 4 or 5 years now my dad has been abusing alcohol pretty bad, day drinking all day etc. 
I fortunately didnâ€™t see all the bad/dark times heâ€™s gotten into, (only heard of it from my sister, who hears it from my mom). Iâ€™ve only gotten to witness it a few times and thatâ€™s plenty enough for me. 
One time we were all on vacation and it was so bad that he was literally reminding me and everyone that he was acting like â€œfrank, from shameless tv show) doesnâ€™t help that his name is frank also lol 
But literally laying out in the concrete, stayed up all night drinking, woke up drunk still.. and then tries to drive to the store (drunk) to get more beer. Heâ€™s already an extremely stubborn person, but when he drinks itâ€™s on another fucking level. I had to end up driving because he wouldnâ€™t stop saying he was gonna drive himself if no one else will. The whole situation was pretty ugly.
A recent one that happened last September was worse though.  Weâ€™re all hanging out by the pool, cookin out &amp; drinking and he starts to have too much.. and ends up getting really emotional crying about his childhood, etc. (when he drinks he tends do end up talking about his childhood) but anyways, it escalates  he starts to make my wife cry, (not by yelling or being mean or anything) but just by bringing up some shit that she went through as a child. They hug it out and everything, and heâ€™s saying sorry blah blah.... fast forward that night a few hours and weâ€™re all at home now ( we all live really close to each other.) and apparently heâ€™s still drinking heavily.. he ripped off all the paintings in their house, and ended up taking his truck, leaving the house drunk, blocking everyoneâ€™s numbers, stopped sharing his location etc. so my mom is crying hysterically, and doesnâ€™t know what do.. my sister and I are saying that we should call the police (bc drunk driving is stupid af) and sheâ€™s begging us not too.. telling us thatâ€™s itâ€™s okay, that heâ€™s going to key west most likely. (He has a obsession with the beach/ocean, itâ€™s his happy place)
Everyone calling him multiple times, go straight to voicemail..etc. we donâ€™t want my mom to be alone, so she comes over to our house.. by like 1am he finally responds to my mom, saying heâ€™s sorry and that heâ€™s coming back home. That whole evening was extremely discomforting. The next day he tells everyone heâ€™s sorry and that â€œheâ€™s never drinking againâ€ which heâ€™s states everyone he drinks too much. Since then he stopped for a few months (to my knowledge)  but then started to pick it back up a little bit. He was drinking at the Christmas get together.. which was obvious (you could just smell it on him). 
My mom doesnâ€™t tell me when heâ€™s drinking (because she knows Iâ€™m going to end up saying something) so she tells my sister, but my sister tells me everything. 

Iâ€™m kinda going everywhere on this post so Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s a little hard to read. 

 Heâ€™s 50, so heâ€™s for sure goingthrough some sort of midlife crisis.. 
heâ€™s also for sure depressed and still has trauma from his childhood (he had a pretty rough up bringing)
Heâ€™s a pretty extreme person, everything he tackles in life, he goes 200% .. example: heâ€™s pretty overweight (heâ€™s been overweight my entire life and Iâ€™m 24) when he eats healthy, itâ€™s fucking healthy.. nothing bad goes into his body.. but then when that stops, and starts eating unhealthy, heâ€™ll eat 7 donuts in a row + ice cream etc. heâ€™s a hardcore â€œcold turkeyâ€ type of person.. but that obviously doesnâ€™t work for him. 


Thereâ€™s sooooooo much I could say
But my dad is an amazing man (besides all of this shit) he turns into a different person when he drinks.

What is the best plan of action to get him to realize heâ€™s gotta stop drinking all the time?  Itâ€™s like weâ€™re all walking around egg shells and Iâ€™m not doing it any longer itâ€™s stupid. 
(I can provide more  information if anyone needs it)

We just really want to him help. I want him to be healthy. I want him to live way longer, I want him to be able to witness my wife and I have kids etc.

alcoholism,,"Heavy fraternity drinker recently stopping consistently drinking nightly Howdy folks,

Basically your typical frat guy (minus the douchey attribute, our frat doesnâ€™t mess with Chads and Brads) and I have a pretty solid history of drinking almost nightly 8-12 beers since last April

Well long story short, I was immature and realized that might have taken a toll on my body as I developed pretty consistent heart palpitations and dizziness the morning after. About 3 days ago, I decided to take a break from constantly drinking with other guys in the fraternity and Iâ€™ve seen drastic improvements (no more dizziness, more focused, all without any noticeable withdrawals).

However, the main thing I realize now is I kind of began to rely on alcohol to fall asleep. Now I am not able to fall asleep for 2-3 hours after trying and canâ€™t even manage to sleep for more than 3-4 hours after I do manage to. I am a very high-strung / energetic person and normally donâ€™t need much sleep, but at this point after 3 days itâ€™s starting to build up.

Any suggestions on how I can get back to a normal sleeping schedule / fall asleep normally? I intend on taking a pretty decent break from drinking at least until I can sleep normally sober.

Heâ€™s not physically violent if conflict arises, but he can yell if it comes to it... his eyes start to get watery, he canâ€™t pronounce words and thinks everything is funny. He basically thinks he is on top of the world and everything is just fine.

Most of the time I pretend like nothing is going on and talk to him like I normally would. Sometimes, however, I canâ€™t... I just sit in silence and wait for him to ask whatâ€™s wrong. He knows why I become mute but he likes pressing me which really annoys me. 

When heâ€™s not drunk we can do all sorts of activities together and we even go to the gym and play golf together. I like that good version of my dad which really conflicts me. 

Nobody in the family besides me and my sister know, and he is very good at pretending like heâ€™s got it all under control. He also talks a lot of sh** behind my back when heâ€™s drunk.

I really donâ€™t know what to do and would greatly appreciate any advice. Thank you for listening"

I do drink often and most of the time Iâ€™m just looking forward to the next time I can drink. Iâ€™m 22 and Iâ€™m getting blood work done because my doctors are concerned about my liver function, which is a huge wake up call for me.

alcoholism,,"My motherâ€™s an alcoholic and I fear Iâ€™m becoming one too. Iâ€™m 22 years of age and ever since I was a boy my motherâ€™s been an alcoholic.

Her father died when I was about 3 so I canâ€™t remember how she was after it, my father always said thatâ€™s why she became an alcoholic but she always sort of was before it too.

My grandmother treated my mother like shit and made her do all the cooking and cleaning and everything to maintain the house when she was younger, she even charged my mother for babysitting any of us. She was and still is a true nasty piece of work who favours my uncle over my mother. I sometimes think this is why sheâ€™s an alcoholic. Iâ€™m the only one left in the house with her and most nights I get met with hate and rage in her eyes because I look like my father, my dad cheated on her about 6 years ago and they divorced but it made her worse and me being the only one left in the house and looking like my father, it was directed all to me. Sheâ€™d kick me out of the house, punch, kick and slap me. Once telling me she didnâ€™t know she was pregnant with me at the start and had went through some sort of operation and I survived, when I was a boy sheâ€™d call me her miracle. She used it against me and told me she lied and seeing he way I turned out she wished I had of died whenever she got drunk of course. You get used to the abuse that I donâ€™t care about.

What Iâ€™m worried about is my behaviour towards drugs and alcohol, I smoke weed everyday. I have since I was 13. It has become an addiction at this point, I messed around with co-codamols(which is a painkiller that contains codeine) I took 18 one day not all at once but spread out during the day, I started vomiting blood and was in hospital. I stopped taking them and now I drink when I canâ€™t afford weed. I just feel Iâ€™m going in the same spiral as my mother and the thought scares the shit out of me. When Iâ€™m not drunk or high I get fidgety and feel like a crackhead. Iâ€™ve been to the doctors who have sent me through different addiction groups I had to contact them myslef and where I am is out in the country so things like funding addiction courses out there isnâ€™t possible. I rang so many places all sending me to different one until I said fuck it no one seems to care. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you"

alcoholism,,"First time post. Wife of alcoholic husband. Need some guidance. I'll try to keep this as brief as I can.

I'm terrified of Tuesdays.
Tuesday is the day where I go to work and my husband has the day off. This usually means he drinks all day, and I come home to a drunk person talking at me. After three years of dealing with all his drunkenness, it's an instant fight. Screaming, glass breaking, holes in the walls, neighbors calling the landlord...

Except it me who it doing it. It's me that's angry and uncontrollable. 

I'm done being the sober hostage in my own home, but I have no family in this town to go to and he knows it. I ask him to have his sisters pick him up to leave and he refuses. 

We have done therapy and were released after six sessions because we had good communication skills and ""we could work this out ourselves"". 

He refuses to go to AA because ""those people have real problems"".

If you are wondering, ""He only drinks on Tuesdays, what's the big deal?"", it's been three years to **get him to drink one day a week** and my only request is dont drink/be drunk before I get home from work. No one wants to be greeted by a drunk person. 

Some things he's done to get us here in this bad place:
Punched a dresser, producing a boxer's fracture and was out of work for six weeks, leaving me with all the bills and I had to cancel my Cholecystectomy that I had been waiting nine months to get pushed through insurance. Waited another two months and had another attack before the surgery happened. - Courtesy of an 18 pack.

Babysat my daughter (summer visits) while we were dating, drunk, three separate times (age 7. and twice at 9) Other adults were around, thank god, but no excuse to be around my kid intoxicated. - Courtesy of four tall boys

Recently decided it's a good idea to go on drives while drunk. I tell him about the repercussions of taking a life. He still does it.

I hate being around him drunk. I hate myself for being here.

Should I let him keep me his sober hostage? Am I looking at this wrong? It's how I truly feel.

I took an anger management class a few years ago I can see so many red flags. I just don't know what to do."
alcoholism,,"Am I doomed? How can I possibly quit? Why are we afflicted with this disease? Why do we get so much more out of alcohol than the average person?

I broke down crying last night after I saw a video of myself passed out drunk. I was in complete oblivion - you could tell by the vacant look on my face. I didnâ€™t cry due to embarrassment, but because it validated something Iâ€™ve known inside for a while: Iâ€™m so damn unhappy. I have no zest for life. Alcohol fills the void, and the only moments that I feel the slightest sense of well-being is when I am blind drunk, in which case I marvel at the simple fact of being alive. 

Why do I have to rely on this substance that is quite literally killing me, just to feel the same as everybody else? And further to that point, how am I possibly meant to quit? I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough to do this."
alcoholism,,"Realizing partner is High Functioning Alcoholic I'm a 37yo M who has a history of heavy drinking and at times bing drinking and I've felt dependency develop a few times but I've been able to thankfully cut back when I've really needed to without too much trouble. However as I've recently cut way back after about 3 years of pretty constant heavy drinking I've reflected on my current partners (34yo F) drinking habits and I'm realizing they truly are an alcoholic, albeit a high-functioning one. Single mom, excels at her work and her life is mostly on track. But I wanted to share some of the things I've personally noticed in their habits that stood out to me incase it helps someone else realize their person might truly have a problem.

1) When I bring up the subject of their drinking I invariable get the retort that I am ""judging"" them no matter how I frame my question. 

2) They have multi-day benders. Whereas I might drink heavy and be hungover for a good day - and then usually wait at least 36-48 hours before I even look at alcohol again - they will just keep their buzz going by drinking as early as they can...9am...10am. But sometimes still go to work...pick up her kids buzzed etc. 

3) They will regularly drink before going to work and sometimes it's not a small amount. Gum and mints are a constant necessity for this reason. I am often also asked to smell their breath to see if I can smell booze. 

4) They will be late in coming home from when they said they would be home and not text -- I'll be watching her kids and making dinner and I don't mind. But when I ask them to kindly let me know if they're heading out to the bar to just shoot me a quick text just so I know what's going on. But I often get a defensive response and some bit about how I'm too nosy and about how they feel anxious that they feel like they have to check in with me. 

5) They have a distinct ""drunk"" personality and a ""sober"" one and I am crazy in love with the sober one but often find myself incredibly annoyed at the drunk version of her. 

6) They dont make very much money but easily spend $100/wk on beer, wine and going out. And that's just solely for themselves. 

7) They purposely go to dives that serve strong drinks even if they're dangerous or out of the way. 

Anyhow -- I know this isn't a unique situation and I would leave her if everything else about the relationship wasnt good. They are a very loving person and is a good mother to her kids and I dont think shes ever really putting them at risk because she has enough sense to only get truly wasted when she knows theyre being cared for. But I start to resent her when I notice this intense split in drunk/sober personalities and the defensive guarding when I bring up her habits. I just am not sure how to help her cut back. 

Any suggestions welcome."
alcoholism,,"How can I (F21) effectively help my mom (F42) whoâ€™s become an alcoholic over the last couple years, without hurting our relationship 
A little back story: growing up, I hardly remember my mom ever drinking. She was always sober even when her friends werenâ€™t, if she did drink, it was one or two beers and she always bragged how she never drank hard liquor. My parents divorced when I was 11, and it seems the couple years after that she began to drink more. Fast forward to now, she drinks all the time. Every day, and a lot. Pepsi and whiskey is her weakness, and ultimately itâ€™s what gets her the most fucked up. 

I moved two hours away for college a little over a year ago so I kind of pushed these thoughts to the back of my mind, because Iâ€™m no longer constantly exposed to the toxic environment. I just ended up moving back to finish my last two years of school (I got placed here for the program Iâ€™m in, I did not choose to come here) 

My moms a great mom, her friends, her family, teachers, other parents, everyone tells her all the time how caring and loving she is for her kids, and every other kid she crosses paths with, and she is. When sheâ€™s sober. Getting drunk is really her major downfall. I almost feel as if she prioritizes drinking over some things that she shouldnâ€™t. Itâ€™s definitely gotten worse over the years and it breaks my heart that itâ€™s getting so bad. 

Alcoholism definitely runs in my family, her parents were alcoholics until their mid thirties, and now my grandma is constantly talking about how great it is to be sober. 

Itâ€™s just so hard to get through to my mom because she doesnâ€™t see an issue. She doesnâ€™t understand who she becomes when sheâ€™s drunk or how bad it is and the issues she can cause for everyone around her- she can get decently mean (not physical, just verbal) She sees no problem with it at all, and I donâ€™t know how to effectively convey the message that sheâ€™s ruining her life, as well as her childrenâ€™s, and itâ€™s pushing all of us away. 

I guess my biggest question is,  how can I appropriately address this situation and essentially tell her Iâ€™m distancing myself until she doesnâ€™t drink every day. Iâ€™ve been tempted to when sheâ€™s drunk and Iâ€™m pissed at her but I know that wonâ€™t be effective and will only be more harsh and probably make her angry.

alcoholism,,"I have cut out alcohol, my husband cannot. We are supposed to do this together. My husband and I are trying to cut out alcohol together. I'm succeeding and he is massively struggling. 

I can now go days and even went 2 weeks no booze! When I do drink, I limit myself to only 1 to 2 drinks and it must be in a social setting(no more drinking alone at home). My tolerance is really low at this point and I usually just have 1. I feel like my head is clearer, I have more energy and I'm less puffy/bloated. 

Unfortunately, my husband is having a much more difficult time with giving up the booze. Being sober and much more clear makes the problem of alcohol very contrasting and startling. My husband is often if not always, angry when he drinks and extremely impatient and agitated. We always argue when he drinks. For a long time now, I cannot stand it when he drinks. I have now associated drinking with being a fire starter rather than something fun. I'm tired of it. He said we would be in this together and it's like he's not even trying. It feels lonely, sad and honestly...makes me want to drink again...

alcoholism,,"Trying to figure out ""where I'm at"" Based on reading, and assumptions that feel pretty obvious, 1.75l of 40% a week is probably pretty bad. 25yrs old, 180lbs. My experience with alcohol has only been going on for less than half a year.  I'd generally lean towards my habits being healthy, outside of my alcohol consumption. 

Reading around about other experiences with alcohol kind of confuses tho. I never get hangovers. I, perhaps, assume this is because I stay pretty hydrated (120oz+ of water per day and only drink loose leaf tea)? I don't do mixed drinks or even like them. I drink straight and chase with water (while also drinking water), which feels way better than chasing with soda or anything else, anyway.

alcoholism,,"Fair critiques of AA? Hey yâ€™all I have been around the treatment, recovery, AA scene for a couple of years now. I have grown against AA, and stopped going 6 months ago, for various reasons. Firstly, Iâ€™d like to state that I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m an alcoholic. Thereâ€™s no need to get into the details of my story as this isnâ€™t the point of the post, but I have remained sober thus far due to me receiving many financial benefits that will impact my financial future greatly. Second I want to share my critiques and problem with the program. I hope to see the other side and what people the live and breath AA have to say about them. My first critique is the simple holy than now attitude that itâ€™s the only way. I was constantly told by other ls that if I left I would relapse and die. This was hilarious to me, as it made absolutely no sense. I donâ€™t understand how that helps anyone to force your believe ls down peopleâ€™s throats. Another problem I have is the people by at large seem to become codependent on the program and have a lack of internal believe in themselves. If youâ€™re told every day youâ€™re powerless and your thinking is fucked up youâ€™ll probably believe it. Again I feel as if this goes against â€œour primary purpose is to stay sober and help others achieve sobriety.â€ There are countless others like lack of scientific data, contradictions throughout the big book, lack of care for advancement in the treatment industry. (Yes treatment industry is AA since 90% only use 12 step method). 

TL DR: been around the scene donâ€™t see myself as an alcoholic. Doesnâ€™t like AA due to its constant dehumanizing manner. Believe everything in it contradicts itself. Treatment industry doesnâ€™t advance, only â€œdiseaseâ€ where itâ€™s acceptable to not research further on effective treatment options.

alcoholism,,"Desperately Need Help with Perspective Hello fellow redditors,

As the title says I am in desperate need of perspective regarding my habitual alcohol intake.

I used drink about 3-4 glasses of wine a day which I knew was a problem. My wife pointed out that it was a problem I needed to work on. So I began my journey of fixing it.

Yes, the beginnings of that change did cause irritability and nights where I didnâ€™t sleep but I got there. During that time my wife told me it was okay to drink of the weekend, so I looked at that as my goal.

Well Iâ€™ve hit that goal and have improved. I donâ€™t drink on the weekdays and have resorted to drinking on the weekends.

My Saturdays and Sundays consist of spreading out a six pack through the mid afternoon to evening. Sometimes I even only drink a tall boy in the evening and thatâ€™s it.

But now Iâ€™m being told that I am an alcoholic again by my wife and I should only drink on special occasions. Iâ€™m constantly being called an alcoholic and I feel that Iâ€™m not being recognized for any of my progress.

Iâ€™m being told that I need to go to AA or I need to leave. I just feel this is unfair and I am not being supported at all. 

Iâ€™d really like a fresh perspective on this situation.

Thank you in advance!"
alcoholism,,"Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right place to post this, itâ€™s kind of long Iâ€™m sorry guys I donâ€™t know where to ask this, Iâ€™m hoping here. Itâ€™s health related due to chronic drinking. All of last year I was drinking heavily, and in November I had switched to vodka or gin. After a particular stint I woke up with blood in the snot from my sinuses and a really dry throat. Not so much sore, but just extreme dryness that felt pinpointed to the spot where your throat and nose connects. Since that moment Iâ€™ve been actively working on cutting back more and more, and wishing to quit fully by 2021. Iâ€™m on day three of being sober right now and I spent half of January sober. The issue is that the feeling in my throat will always come back after being asleep... even after a week off. If I go and huck a loogie in the morning, (sounds gross I apologize) thereâ€™s that same blood in it, and itâ€™s dark and clotted. I have gone to two doctors and they tell me itâ€™s from the dry weather and nothing to be concerned about. I have told them about my drinking as well and that I thought it could be linked, and they donâ€™t seem to be  concerned. Itâ€™s really frightening me, has this happened to anyone else? Am I worrying for no reason? Should I do my best to stay sober longer and see if it goes away? Itâ€™ll start to go away later in the morning then by afternoon Iâ€™ve forgotten about it. But every damn morning itâ€™s there and in the same spot"

Iâ€™ve tried to help her so many times but she wonâ€™t listen. She wonâ€™t get help, and it makes me so frustrated. It hurts so much. I think Iâ€™ve lost her already.

I'm 19 years old and pretty healthy. No history with alcohol. I woke up hungover today which was honestly not that bad at all. However, I'm freaking out because a numbness in my right arm and hand has not subsided throughout the day. Anyone have any advice or solutions? How worried should I be?"
alcoholism,,"I went to an AA meeting for the first time I don't know if I can call myself an alcoholic. I've always been a responsible drinker, I never blacked out, went on a bender, or ruined a friendship or relationship over alcohol. I didn't ""call in sick"" just to drink, lie to my family about it, wasted my paycheck on it, or did some other stupid things. So maybe I'm not a textbook alcoholic.

&amp;#x200B;

But I did notice over the last 2 years that I started looking forward to drinking. And when I do drink, I feel relieved, like ""aaah, finally"". I did try to stop drinking. Or to limit it to 1 time a week. But I failed to keep that promise too.

&amp;#x200B;

This got me really worried. What if I'm not an alcoholic, but if I keep on going that path I'd become one? I tried to shake this thought off of me, until yesterday. I promised I wouldn't drink, but I did. And I felt this ""aaah, finally"" feeling again.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I decided to go to an AA meeting today. It felt weird, but in a good way. I've always admired people, who are able to just remain sober. I met some guys who've been sober since the 90's and it was an inspiring meeting."

alcoholism,,"A question about my AA experience Hello, I'm a 32m alcoholic. My drinking is more sporadic than daily, but I could never stop once I start. My question is about AA.

In trying to fight this drinking thing, everyone tells you to go to AA. So I went to AA, and I was put off by how hard it was to fully integrate. I attended weekly meetings, the same meeting, for two months and stayed sober the whole time. 

I wanted to start the program and become accountable to myself, but my sponsor kept putting me off. He said I wasn't integrated into the group enough, hadn't met enough members by staying after and picking up chairs, etc. 

Is it like this everywhere? I just wanna get sober, dude. Not engage in forced socialization rituals like a toddler. I can meet people and socialize just fine. But using it as a barrier before I could start on my sobriety put me the hell off. 

Anyways, that was four months ago, I've lost all progress I made in that 2 months."

I thought about buying flavored sparkling water (bubly) for the affect but I wonâ€™t be trashing my body. Thoughts? Thanks!!
alcoholism,,"Concerned for my sister and need to rant Hey, made a throw away because she knows my main acct. 

Tonight has been especially hard, sheâ€™s called me several times progressively more drunk. Sheâ€™s in a bad place mentally, struggling with depression and in an extremely toxic relationship and i understand that drinking is her way of coping. Its so hard to see and iâ€™m not sure what to do at this point. She canâ€™t go a night without drinking, even on a light night sheâ€™ll take 5 shots and not feel it. but she blacks out easily and often. Somewhat recently I went through a bad breakup and really needed her for support, and weâ€™d talk for hours each night (sounding at least mostly sober) but sheâ€™d always forget the conversations. We talk often, but itâ€™s pretty much guaranteed that if sheâ€™s calling after sheâ€™s off work sheâ€™s not going to remember the conversation. Sheâ€™s my older sister and sheâ€™s always been my rock and the person i turn to when i need someone to be there, but iâ€™m losing all trust in her and donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m able to have a genuine conversation. It feels like a huge loss and itâ€™s entirely out of my control. Iâ€™m in college and live over 3hrs away so thereâ€™s really nothing i can do. Itâ€™s a friday and sheâ€™s arguing with her SO so i know for a fact tonight sheâ€™s drinking very heavily. sheâ€™s not able to speak on the phone or reply coherently over text at this point and iâ€™m just being eaten up with worry. Not really sure why iâ€™m posting this, i guess i have no one that i can talk to about it and i just need to get all my feelings out. Hopefully someone out there can relate. Just feeling super sad and so fucking worried."
alcoholism,,"What's the drunkest you've ever been? I wasn't a drinker in college, went years between drinks. But the last year in school, living off campus in a student housing place, I  had a few weeks where I was drinking some, for the first time in my life ( was probably 23 at the time). I started to drink screwdrivers.

One weekend, my roommates had some friends over a Friday night, and I was having screwdrivers. I of course ended up drinking too much, and partially blacked out during the night. I spent part of the night keeled over the kitchen sink puking. I eventually puked on the kitchen floor. At maybe 3-4am, my roommate (Filipino guy ex-marine and college student) came to check on me, and slipped in the puke on the kitchen floor. He insisted on asking me, making me explain why I made him step/slip in my puke, even though I was wasted out of my mind and barely knew what he was asking (I only really remembered this later). 

I then woke up in the living room at 10am, still drunk, and went to my room. I spent the next 36 hours in my bed, wondering if I was going to die. I threw up 5 times that Saturday after I woke up (my resting heart rate was 110-120bpm), and was stuck in bed in a fetal position, until around 10-11pm Sunday night, before I finally started to feel somewhat okay. 

The ironic part is, I then went years again between drinks, but then when I finally started to drink again, at 28 years old, I actually became an heavy drinker. I've been drinking consistently for 5 years, I'm 33 now, and I'm absolutely certain I've been as drunk or drunker than I was that one night in college. The difference is, I have a tolerance now, and I've never been as sick as I was that one night. 

Anyway, I've never felt as terrible from drinking as that one night in college. What's the drunkest you've ever been?"

Until last weekend.

I blocked my family on social media and I know an apology would fix it, especially since my mom is an alcoholic and would be very understanding. I donâ€™t want to fix it though. 

I stayed suicidal pretty much all week. Feeling like a failure. Itâ€™s starting to pass. My ex and I have paperwork this weekend to do, I donâ€™t wanna. He hates me too but only because I left.

Probably the biggest fight weâ€™ve gotten in, and family got involved. I was blacked out through a big portion of it, but I do know I said some pretty awful things. 

Iâ€™m positive that if I donâ€™t make some major changes starting now, Iâ€™m going to lose my partner for good. Iâ€™m honestly worried starting now might be too late. The problem is, is I feel this weird shame about admitting I need help and that I realistically probably need to be in a program like AA. Iâ€™ve dabbled in it before, but I always felt embarrassed by it and kind of out of place. The idea of not drinking again also makes me feel kind of, well, angry. 

I guess for right now, Iâ€™m just looking for some advice to handle this weird shame so I can get the help I need. Also, just some general advice for getting through the first few weeks of this.

alcoholism,,"Turning the drinking down to lose weight I am having trouble staying sober. It isn't really impacting my life, but I want to lose 30/60lbs. Any advice on how not to drink when you come home from work?"
alcoholism,,"Day One. Again. I am 34 and I've been struggling with alcohol for 15 years, I fell into drinking when my father passed away unexpectedly from heart failure. I have managed to get sober for 6 months at a time here and there, and even a whole year once, but my life is particularly unfortunate and it seems I return to the old familiar whenever things get to be too much. Last January I quit cold turkey after being a 15 beer a night drinker and I started taking care of myself again. I got on medication for my depression and started feeling a bit more positive, everything was on the up and up. 

But then in July of last year I did a backslide and fell off the wagon when a very disturbing event occured that turned my life upside down. It literally broke me mentally and I lost my mind for a while. I was really disappointed in myself but I don't have many healthy coping mechanisms, so I always turn to the only thing I know makes me stop thinking about things, excessive amounts of alcohol. I suffer from PTSD, bipolar and anxiety disorder, among other things. I was also diagnosed with lupus last year. 

I have been drinking almost every day since last July. I have an app I use (AlchoDroid) which tracks my consumption and BAC when I am drinking. I have to keep track of this because I have a tendency to just drink until I black out and then the stupid stuff happens and I make life harder for myself. Is that the sign of a professional alcoholic? Keeping track of your intake so you can still get hammered without getting yourself into trouble? It's sad really. 

A couple of weeks ago I received yet more bad news that made me want to drink even more. The most important person to me in the whole world might have lung cancer.

 But I am at a 200+ beer a month habit. My body hates me, my stomach is a mess and I hardly eat, I'm getting sicker and weaker, and I'm also bleeding internally in my lower GI tract. I Honestly if I didn't have someone in this world to live for, I'd probably just let it consume me.

But I can't. I can't keep doing this to myself. I've got someone here who needs me. And not this ghost of a person that barely makes it to 3pm before cracking a cold one. Not this depressed, sick person who can barely get out of bed some days. I owe it to those I love, and to myself, to start caring again.

And step one is getting sober. Starting now. All of the booze from last night is out of my system. My blood is alcohol free. I know that craving is gonna kick in around 2pm, but I can fight it. I know I can. I've done it before. 

Today is day one. Again. 

Wish me luck."

I believe there's a stigma around groups like that. Especially the kind of drinker I am. I'm not someone who has to have a drink when I first wake up or drink everyday. So I think my wife is kinda ashamed if i go to these meetings. But I hate what my relationship with alcohol has become and I need to take positive steps to becoming sober and I believe AA is an important step for me"
alcoholism,,"My drinking is a getting out of control I feel like I can't stop I have schizophrenia and hear voices especially when trying to go to sleep if I'm reading or watching a movie, working or with people it's manageable, there is no way I can sleep, if I drink enough it makes me less reactive to any hallucinations and I can get to sleep but Im now drinking excessive amounts every evening to the point I'm sometimes missing work/college or turning up hungover and stinking of alcohol which is sooner or later going to get me in trouble particularly at work, I will get sacked sooner or later its been noticed and I have gotten away with it so far with a light scolding. I can't really imagine quitting, it's the highlight of my day when I get home and start drinking. At lunchtime I will feel drowsy and like crying, by the time I get home my body is ready for drink and I feel so much better. I have a lot of existential sadness and intense fear based around paranoid beliefs and loneliness, and when I drink I become more accepting of my circumstances. I'm also single and the dates I have had sober have all been the worst. I can't imagine quitting but it's getting worse, my health is obviously  depreciating and I'm skipping so many responsibilities, I can't even keep my room clean it's a mess. I have no idea what to do, January was by far the most I have ever drank in a month in my life, some days I will be so tired from work I will have maybe 3 strong beers and just fall asleep from days of 4 hours sleep in a row but that is becoming quite rare now. There is no solution, All I can do is try to limit my intake but all of us struggling know that is extremely difficult, I can drink quite a bit now without feeling too bad in the morning and I just push it so often.

alcoholism,,"Im badly in need of help. Hi reddit, im a 22 year old man and I call myself a binge alcoholic. If you would look at my life as it is sober, everyone would say that i'm living great. I have a well respected pay and job. I have a beautiful apartment in the middle of my city. I have great friends and i'm a quite attractive and charming guy.

However I can't feel worthy of anything I got and I've come to the conclusion that it is because of my alcohol problems. I work 9-5 every weekday. After every working week I will always go out and get black out drunk. I mean every weekend, always blacked out. The big problem with this is that when I am blacked out I turn into the worst version of myself. I am agressive, creepy with girls, over confident and cocky. The list with bad qualities can go on for days, just imagine the anoying guy you never want to drink with. Every sunday I will wake up with the biggest anxiety and imagine everyone laughing at everything I did and said last night. I will imagine everyone hating me. I have lost many good relationships with friends/girls im dating for being the guy I am when drunk. I've never realised that alcohol was the problem. It has been in the back of my head but I did not want to admit it. I love partying and going out, 1/10 times I can control my drinking and behaviour. Then I will have a really good time.

The reason to why I have realised this problem now is becouse the first 3 weeks of January I had no time to go out and I could just feel my life changing. I stopped my bad habits of smoking and watching porn. I got confident, I was doing my job really great and I can say that I found some kind of meaning to this life. Then I went out, got blacked out. I started my other bad habbits again because of the anxiety. 2 weeks later and I've done the same thing 3 weekends in a row. Im stuck in this bad circle and I can not see a way out. I want to feel good again and I know that I have to stop binge drinking. I know that my sober self is great and worthy.

I don't know if this is just a rant for attention or an actual cry for help. I want to know if anyone else is familiar with my feelings and what I can do to control my alcoholism.

I wonâ€™t go into it, but I make horrible decisions in public. I donâ€™t drink around others anymore because they cast their opinions on me.

Iâ€™m afraid of how much I drink, but I wonâ€™t tell anyone because I think it would sound like Iâ€™m over exaggerating to people in my life. I want to tell someone, but I donâ€™t want to be brushed off or told that my drinking is normal. I know that Iâ€™m very young, but Iâ€™m fearful about how far Iâ€™ll go.

alcoholism,,"Inspiration post (my Dad's success story) Remove if not allowed, I read the rules but I may have misunderstood the purpose for this sub. Apologies if that's the case. 

TLDR: my dad beat his alcoholism and we reconnected and I'm proud of him. 

My father was 16 the first time his older sister took him out and bought him a drink. He told me he liked forgetting. He was born in 1962, the 11th child of a very poor family riddled with substance abuse and dysfunction. As a child he was abused in ways I won't disclose, and a lot of the older siblings had contempt for him. 
By the time he was married and moved states away he had a full fledged addiction to booze. He was a violent, mean and nasty drunk most of my life. 

But when he was sober he was gentle, witty and funny, and sharp as a tack despite no formal education. I didn't get to see the sober side often. I never knew him, really.

What I knew was that he lost his job, did some really scary things, and went to prison. I was just finishing highschool and starting college, and I was scared of him, so we lost touch for maybe 3-4 years.

He became homeless after he was released because family got sick of him, so he moved about 20 hours from here to start over.

One day I wanted to get back in touch, it had been years, I was now graduated college, married, and in my own house, I wanted him to know I loved him and felt it important to break the silence, so I asked my uncle who is a retired PI to find an address or a number to contact my dad. I got his cell and we talked for hours.

The best news of 2019 was hearing him say he had worked with AA and a church group and was three consecutive years sober. I was in shock, and I felt immense pride and happiness. He told me how hard it was, but that he did it for me, for my family, and for himself.

It's been surreal and so great to talk to him and hear that personality and charm my mom always told me about, I felt like I was meeting the real him for the first time. 

He tried his best to be a father, but he didn't have any father figure himself, or any emotional tools to work through what had been done to him as a young person. He lost everything. And he chose to start over and keep fighting his addiction. He was a functioning alcoholic with a solid job for 20 years. He was never late on bills. He was all around a good guy except for this. And it nearly destroyed him in the end, even though on the surface he managed it well for years.

I'm not here to lecture, I'm just here as an adult child who saw her father's success and wanted to share something with you. I truly believe that if he can admit and change his life around, then anyone else can too. There's no such thing as too late. 

I love you, dad. :)"
alcoholism,,"All the worst memories of my life have happened under the influence of alcohol but I donâ€™t know how to socialize without it. Every bad thing that has happened to myself and my relationships has occurred while I was drinking. When I drink I have no filter. Iâ€™m me but fun and uninhibited and outgoing, until Iâ€™m not. 

I shamelessly flirt with people I donâ€™t even know or like. I make rude and tone-deaf comments. I become so obnoxious and end up retreating/going dark for days on end afterwards out of embarrassment. 

Right now Iâ€™m making the decision to let go of the person I am when Iâ€™m drinking and happy because the person I turn into after the fun wears off is unbearable. 

Does anyone have tips on socializing sober? Iâ€™m in my mid twenties, everyone in my life drinks so short of finding all new friends and never seeing my family my only option is to find myself and my place as a sober person."

After trying the only rehab center here once I exhausted all the in patient treatment options. My local Dr. has been trying to help but there is only so much she can do.

alcoholism,,"Thoughts just before 100 days So this might get a bit rambley, I'm jotting my thoughts down for the first time.

I've been having a rough time between 90 and 100 days, two milestones I've been really looking forward to. Cravings, dreams, anxiety. I thought those days were over since I had felt so good days 60-90. This is the longest I've ever been sober. (I know, I need to reset my badge - took very many attempts to get here.) But I realized I had just let my sobriety become more passive. It wasn't as hard to fight anymore, so I stopped giving it the attention it still needed. Situationally, life has had a couple bumps with work recently. I'm able to recognize that and see that I need to do some some emotional tidying instead of drowning it with booze.

So, while the cravings may come, and I know they do, even many years later, I'll still be able to chip away at myself and learn something new. There's always a way to grow from these challenges. 

I guess it gets easier, but it ain't ever easy. But hopefully, only because the best is yet to come. I love this community and am rooting for every single one of you. IWNDWYT. ðŸ’™"

alcoholism,,"How can I help a friend to accept that he has a problem and help him to rehab? A friend of my family who I have also known for years has a problem with alcohol which led him to get kicked out by his girlfriend(also long term friend of my family) at the end of december. since he doesn't have a job he went to visit his son in another country where he got kicked out aswell after a few weeks. Now he is currently back in my city where he stays at his moms as far as I know.
In person, I have never seen him completely wasted but heard stories from different people. When he usually comes to visit my city he would always stay at a friend's house who I visited a lot and he always had a few drinks as soon as it got dark and always stayed up late and sleep until noon. But he is banned there aswell. Years ago it was beer and wine and about two years ago he switched to gin. He sometimes messages me and others random texts in the middle of the night(1am - 6am),with the worst one beeing he will kill himself. Next day when I read it and called him he said it was just a joke. 

Now why do I think, although I am not as close to him as others, that I have the right/that it's my ""duty"" to help him? 
I have been in a similar situation a few months ago, although my addiction wasn't alcohol but video games. I went to rehab where most people were alcoholics or addicted to pills and from my experience, we are all not that different and reach to our substance for similar reasons. So I do feel that I understand him to a certain point and help him by going to the same clinic.

Yesterday I sent him a long text message that he should consider rehab, I want to help him, share my experience in more detail with him than before, answer all his questions and how it affected me and was the best decision I have ever made. And I will not tell anyone about this. (Which is true because it's a not so easy topic) 

That was probably not the most clever move but I just said fuck it, I have to be honest to him and just tell him straight away. That's how it worked for me when friends and family sat me around a table and confronted me. 

I sent him that message at 9am, he read it a few hours later and I got a reply the next day at 2am. 
Of course he denied it. His answer was that he doesn't know who's spreading those rumors and that he was at a hospital in his son's country and he came back to my city to get a better diagnose. (This is true to some point since he had an issue with his pancreas years ago, and still does apparently. What a coincidence...) Also he asked if his brother spread those rumors, that he is an alcoholic and that his brother is just jealous of him. 

I must agree that his brother is a heavy drinker aswell but he has his life together! 

Now I don't know what to do further and how to answer on his last message and especially how to   help him accept it. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope that you can help me! Thank you very much!!"
alcoholism,,"Father is a moderate alcoholic Some backstory, My parents divorced about 10 years ago. I've been living abroad for the last 4 years so I haven't kept in super close touch with my family.  I moved back to the US and I've been staying with my father for the last 5 months. 

It's really disappointing to see how dependent on alcohol he's become.  I don't think his alcoholism is as severe as a lot of the cases I read on here. But for him, he is drinking beer every day when the sun goes down. Literally he cannot skip a day. I would guess he's probably drinking 7-8 coors lights every day and chain smoking while he's drinking. 

I think he's really depressed. I've tried to take him aside and explain to him my feelings, and he'll admit he should make a change, but I think he simply has no desire to change.

From my perspective he's wasting his life drinking so much... Damaging his health and giving up so many life activities that could be enjoyable for him that he doesn't pursue because he's medicating himself with alcohol. I think the underlying issue is that he's depressed, he doesn't have many good hobbies or close friends. Just works and looks forward to drinking at night.

alcoholism,,"I canâ€™t sleep because of my dadâ€™s drinking Iâ€™m 25, graduated college in 2018, and am seeking employment related to my major. That being said, Iâ€™ve been at home living with my dad for the time since Iâ€™ve graduated to try and help him out. 

He doesnâ€™t get super drunk every night (at least not for the past year or so) but heâ€™s developed pretty severe panic/anxiety disorder which Iâ€™m 99% sure is related to short term effects from drinking. Itâ€™s a pretty often scenario for him to wake up in the middle of the night and come down to my room having anxiety for me to calm him down and try to decide if we go to the ER. On the worst night we do go to the ER, his BP is staggering (like stroke level), and he experiences extreme chest pains. 

I was feeling better about the situation recently as he agreed to taper his drinking and the decrease in anxiety was readily apparent, I felt like I had my dad back for the first time in years and could clearly communicate with him. A few weeks ago however I had to go on an emergency trip to help my girlfriend move and in the time I was gone heâ€™s fallen into old habits.

Because of the many sleepless nights worried about him, the countless times heâ€™s withdrawn or become angry with me for no reason, the hospital trips, etc. I think Iâ€™m a little traumatized by it all and now every time I see him having a drink it really messes up my mood and often my day never really comes back from the moment I see him drinking in excess of his taper goals.

I also canâ€™t help but pay attention to how much heâ€™s drinking as in my mind each drink increases the likelihood I will need to take him to the hospital between 2-6 AM (when the booze wears off and most anxiety attacks occur). At this point Iâ€™m not really sleeping unless I basically pass out from exhaustion which usually happens around 8 AM or so. Iâ€™ve tried to explain whatâ€™s going on but he responds with anger. 

I would appreciate any input. Thanks.

My significant other is out of town on business every few months. I find myself getting excited about these times that I know he will be gone because this is how the process usually goes:
1) If I know he will be gone by the time I get off work, I have already made my mind up about what I am going to pickup on the way home to drink (recently switched from Bud Light to White Claw because Iâ€™m believing the lie I tell myself that it isnâ€™t as bad for my health). Iâ€™m excited about it literally ALL DAY and canâ€™t wait to get home and start feeling buzzed/drunk
2)I try to talk myself out of drinking that night multiple times throughout the day because I know I shouldnâ€™t, and I know I will end up feeling like shit the next day because I have trouble stopping after â€œjust a fewâ€
3)step 2 goes out the window the second I start the trip home and pull into the gas station for my drink of choice
4)immediately chug 2 cans when I walk in the door to â€œget it goingâ€ quicker
5)after about 4-5 more Iâ€™m pretty intoxicated and switch from drinking to binge eating whatever sounds good at the time
6)call hubby and tell him I had 1 drink and a salad
7)full as a tick and drunk as a skunk I shuffle to bed and fall asleep
8)repeat steps 2-6 the next day if I know I will be home alone

alcoholism,,"How much can my body and brain recover from my alcohol abuse? Hey everyone!   
I had serious issues with alcohol since I was only 16 years old and they went more severe with every year that passed. I drank until I blacked out most of the times and after work or when I was alone I was drinking every day at least in the evening to be able to sleep a few hours. I drank at least 3-4 beers (0,5l) every day and when I was out I was drinking until I totally blacked out. 

Now, about 10 years later, I met a person who changed my life entirely. I fell in love with a Muslim girl and everything went great. She accepted me the way I was, even tho I had crippling anxiety and I hated my body due to my drinking. Things went more serious and I learned about Islam and converted. I quit drinking totally, started to work on myself, workout etc.. and I never felt more amazing all of my life. It's been several months already without relapsing and I don't even feel a desire to do so. 

Now, after I have tortured my body and brain cells with alcohol for over 10 years, I wonder if there is a chance to regenerate completely from the heavy abuse or if there is some damage done that will never fully recover.  
I still have issues with my anxiety and also sometimes feel ""insufficient"". These mental issues were born by my past alcohol abuse, I am pretty sure about that.. but is there a chance to get rid of them by just continuing to workout and stay away from alcohol?

Iâ€™ve never seen alcohol affect anyone quite like it  does with my mum. She literally transforms into a vicious crone, and I imagine if she was born the 17th or 16th centuries, she would of been accused of being a witch and burnt alive at the stake..

My mum is a very abusive alcoholic. During my childhood she use to beat me black and blue and my younger brother nearly died as a baby due to neglect. 

At one time she left the grill on and left the house to get more alcohol and the house filled up with black smoke and me and my brother could of died, if it wasnâ€™t for a neighbour kicking the door in and rescuing us.
One time me and my brother was in my step dads car (my brother is my half brother) and she was drunk as usual and crashed into another car.. luckily no one was hurt.

My childhood memories was filled with an empty stomach due to neglect and the beatings.

After failing to pick me up from school on time and the new head teacher saw for himself how drunk she was and her being abusive to the other teachers. Social services got involved and finally put me and my brother info care.

She still drinks to this day. Just last year she caused a fire by falling asleep with a cigarette and one of her dogs died in the fire.

Sheâ€™s a mess.

Sheâ€™s never worked either since I can remember and just parasitises from the state, family, neighbours and myself.  I use to transfer her money but stopped enabling her.

Since Iâ€™ve had cancer she still tries to scrounge money from me and got jealous of other family members supporting me and not her. 

I still work even tho I have cancer and she complains about being destitute and that sheâ€™s the victim..

My mum is beyond help. She really is. My brother has cut her off completely and so has most of her siblings.

alcoholism,,"IOP experts please help Hi, 

Yesterday I received a call from my best friend sobbing and saying sheâ€™s going into 5 day detox. She had IOP earlier that day and Iâ€™m wondering if that has to do with it, since sheâ€™s been so adamant about no detox or rehab. Sheâ€™s been relapsing for about 4 days prior to this. Can IOP force you to go into a detox program if you relapse? I donâ€™t see her confessing that she relapsed to the counselors there, so would she have to show up drunk? Iâ€™m very happy sheâ€™s there but I am so unsettled by not knowing how she ended up there. 

I know every place is different but I would really your stories and knowledge about IOP and relapsing rules, and what happens in detox after IOP. Iâ€™m so lost and scared and her parents are too overwhelmed to tell me what happened (I live across the country). 

thank you."

alcoholism,,"3 months post liver transplant and just found him drinking My MIL's brother is an alcoholic. He ya been for 35 years, but he was diagnosed with liver failure. He was got sober, and we were all so happy. He got a liver transplant after thanksgiving (we actually got the call at thanksgiving dinner!!) 

Unfortunately, his wife died 3 days ago. He was doing SO well, and now it's like he has taken a million steps backwards, completely understandably. He was still sober though, but very sad. He lived with his wife, but now he lives alone. He had been with the family the past 3 days, but today my MIL's family went back home and she had work. After work she stopped by his place to check in and found beer all over, and him very intoxicated. 

He had no remorse. I understand. His motivation was her. He is motivated himself as well, but he his carrot of motivation was to get his license back and take her to the beach. 

My MIL put everything into getting him a new liver and his recovery. She is on the board of a non-profit rehabilitation center (she was long before because she cares deeply about helping addiction). He goes to the center for outpatient and has a sponsor. She is devastated. He is not remorseful at all and seems like he's lost all motivation. 

Does anyone have advice for this situation? I want to be able to support my MIL and her brother, but I'm at a loss. Thank you so much"

alcoholism,,"I hate this. Rant ahead.

Alcoholism is beyond a disease. I've woken up from a blackout literally every single day for ELEVEN months. I'm exhausted. I wake up and commit to stopping, about to dump out all alcohol and give my roommate my wallet so I don't buy more, more strongly than Iâ€™ve ever felt anything and then, literally minutes later, the desire to quit fades and my brain reminds me to take another shot before work. You can handle 9 shots before work, itâ€™s no big deal. Coworkers tell me I smell like alcohol and I feel so dead inside I donâ€™t care at all. My mom gives me 30 days to move out and I still donâ€™t stop drinking. I have no life outside of this illness, on days off from work I'm drunk by 6am.  Iâ€™ve been to jail twice from drinking related offenses, and the 10 minute ride home from work is insanely painful as I make my Uber speed so I can be home and take that first shot. It feels like it will never stop. Iâ€™m only 21 and I already drink enough to buy a 1.75 liter of vodka every 2 days and I get DTs when I stop. I make it three days before the withdrawal, insomnia, and insanely scary dreams drive me to drink. I just want this nightmare to be over. I miss being happy. I know itâ€™s my own fault but I hate my birth family for all being drunks. I just don't know what to do as I can't afford rehab. Sigh. Thanks if you read all this shit"

alcoholism,,"please help. fears. I am a 20 yr old female in an alcoholic family. Pretty much all the males on my dadâ€™s side are alcoholics, and my father happens to be the worst. I still live at home putting myself thru college with my mom and dad. To give a bit of background, my father and I have no real relationship due to his alcoholism. He lost his job in 2008-09â€™ and his abuse of alcohol got worse. My mom and older brother tried talking to him to get him to go to AA, and even reached out to his own mom &amp; dad to talk to him. They donâ€™t believe he has a problem. My dad &amp; I used to be close but those memories of me being 5-6 years old are fading. Iâ€™ve tried my best to talk to him about myself because he really doesnâ€™t know me anymore. I constantly struggle with the â€˜blameâ€™ part. I blame myself, then I blame him, and the whole thing goes back a forth. My dad has decided to spring on my mom that he wants a â€˜consensual divorceâ€™ 
meaning theyâ€™d still live under the same roof, be separated, &amp; pay bills split equally. I already advised my mom to have the papers he presents her with to be looked over by a lawyer. Theyâ€™d only live together until I get out of college, so Iâ€™m the ticking time bomb. With all this in mind, it is extremely hard for me to deal with turning 21 this year. I donâ€™t know if anyone has felt this way about their 21st (if you have an alcoholic parent) but I am not excited about it at all. My friends all really want to have a party for me and I already told them I donâ€™t need a project X party.  For me it just comes with the reminder that I can now do what my father legally does, drink &amp; drive, fall down the stairs, into bushes, fall asleep in my driveway, and so on. Yes he has done all of those. I just feel quite alone and feel guilty for not even being excited for my own birthday, especially an age that is so glorified by everyone.

alcoholism,,"My moms alcoholism is getting worse. So my mom has been a heavy drinker for a while. For the past couple of years she usually has her first glass of wine at about 4 or 5 pm and keeps going until she goes to bed. This means, since I was unable to drive yet, I was trapped at home every day after 4 pm. If I had asked her to drive me somewhere she definitely would because she either doesnâ€™t believe sheâ€™s intoxicated or thinks I just donâ€™t notice, but I knew what was up so I just never asked to be driven around in the evening.  But in the past 6 months or so, itâ€™s gotten bad. Iâ€™m older now so whenever Iâ€™m with her I can thankfully offer to drive. She doesnâ€™t just drink at night anymore, it can be any time of day. Some times she actually drank WHILE driving me around. I think she really truly is convinced that I donâ€™t notice, despite how painfully obvious it is due to how bad she is at hiding her drinking, despite how hard she tries to hide it. Sheâ€™s never uttered the world alcohol, drunk, or let me writhing 5 feet of one of her drinks since the beginning of her disease. She almost never appears drunk though, because she must have an extremely high tolerance at this point. Iâ€™m guessing the recent increase in drinking is just to avoid withdrawals. Thankfully I only have to deal with this every other week since my parents are divorced and have split custody. Sometimes I reallly want to vent to my dad but I know heâ€™d make a whole big deal out of it and something big would happen. I donâ€™t want any confrontation or burnt bridges, and I know for a fact this would happen if she knew I was talking about her drinking. Idk itâ€™s just kind of disheartening that sheâ€™s so careless about my life that she drove me around drunk or so clueless that she doesnâ€™t see the risk.  I donâ€™t really know what to do at this point. Either sheâ€™s in extreme denial or delusion, or simply just doesnâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™ll be off at college soon and wonâ€™t have to worry about it. Iâ€™m positive the liver disease and brain damage will catch up to her soon, and hopefully be a big wake up call."

For the last year and a half Iâ€™ve been self medicating with hard stuff, vodka

alcoholism,,"Anyone who identifies as an alcoholic- did you see this coming? I hope this post isnâ€™t triggering for anyone but Iâ€™m not sure how else to ask the question.

Iâ€™m 22 and about 6 months ago, I went through a devastating breakup. Maybe a year before the breakup, I was a senior and college and having the most stressful year academically, socially and pressure wise (starting a job). Iâ€™ve been drinking since I was a teenager but that year was the first time I started using alcohol as an â€œescapeâ€ but it was pretty mild. Mostly just drinking more wine than normal as a way to chill out when stressed.

Then the breakup hits. This is when I started to drink more heavily. Again Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d say it was outrageous but I probably would drink every day at this point which has continued to now. Iâ€™m not an emotional wreck anymore but when I drink I just zone out in a way that I canâ€™t manage to do without it.

Itâ€™s not at a point where I feel any physical drive to drink or any negative side effects if I donâ€™t. If Iâ€™m in a good mood or have a distracted and busy day itâ€™s not like I notice I havenâ€™t had anything to drink. It also hasnâ€™t affected how I drink socially. Iâ€™m not drinking more quantity wise during nights out. If anything Iâ€™m less of a crazy partner than I was as a teen. But Iâ€™ve been having this feeling lately where I really feel like one day Iâ€™ll have to be completely sober. 

I wasnâ€™t raised in an alcoholic home. My mom never really drinks. My dad recently stopped cold turkey. I ask him about it and he was pretty nonchalant and just said it didnâ€™t do much for him anymore. My mom alluded in private that he was drinking every day so he just cut it out. Iâ€™m starting to feel like thats how Iâ€™ll be. But for right now, itâ€™s so social and now habitual that I donâ€™t see myself realistically stopping.

I see the drinking habits of friends though and I donâ€™t feel out of the ordinary. Mostly everyone drinks often since we are so young and I live in a very drinking- friendly area. I guess I just get freaked out since I live in a one bedroom now and see the amount of alcohol I go though. 

Not sure what Iâ€™m asking for, just the first time Iâ€™m putting it to words i guess?"
alcoholism,,"Got my ass beaten last night. I go wild when I'm drunk. I become a real child. When I'm sober I'm the most awkward, reserved and anxious guy within a 10 mile radius - so imagine everyone's shock to find me on the dancefloor, groping chicks I normally wouldn't have heart enough to talk to, screaming, shouting. The works.

I talk to this one girl who is kinda cute, she's receptive at least. Gives me her number etc. After a while talking to her there comes this guy, a guy who's friends with a kid who decided to make me his enemy after being a dumb drunk when I walked past their argument and said ""well? What are you waiting for? Fuck each other up!"" - it really wasn't smart. This guy is apparently dating her. I didn't buy it but didn't care either way because a friend of the girl rather loudly said ""you're a whore"" to her and turned me off. 

Kid joined in on the conversation, a conversation that was going reasonably well and escalated things and I ended up giving in and fighting him outside. Now I look like a potato. My body is sore now and I can hardly chew any food. I don't like that I even went that low. I don't like how vicious I became. I wanted to kill him. I gouged his left eye and bit a chunk of his ear off, even grabbed and squeezed his balls. Anyway, I didn't think I was like that until I got to the point.

My motherâ€™s an alcoholic she lays in bed and drinks till she knows she will get caught by the rest of the family.  My dad supports her and she realizes she has no responsibilities besides paying bills. She refuses to eat. She flushed food down the drain when I try to make her eat.

alcoholism,,"I know Iâ€™m an alcoholic and I canâ€™t stop I wonâ€™t go into much detail because you all know the feeling. I used to drink a fifth every night for about 2 years. I also had a serious drug problem with Cocaine and countless amphetamines alongside the booze. Iâ€™ve been through 3 separate rehabs ( most of which focused on the stimulants rather than the booze ), and things started getting better. After a few months I moved. For the past 6 months I have been regulating my alcohol intake because Iâ€™ve convinced myself that Iâ€™m not an alcohol but a â€œheavy drinkerâ€, but I can sense the impending doom that is to come. I went from a fifth to 12 pack, to 8, to a six pack, to 3-5 a night. But as much as I tell myself â€œyouâ€™re making progressâ€, I still have cheat days where I slam booze like a fucking WWE superstar... I know Iâ€™ve made progress but the fact of the matter is I still need alcohol to cope with everyday life. It doesnâ€™t matter if the amount I consume decreases; itâ€™s the fact that I need it in the first place that is mentally exhausting. Iâ€™m looking for support, advice; really anyone who has been here and came out on top. 

Side note Iâ€™m also undergoing Ketamine treatments at a local clinic and it has helped tremendously with my anxiety/depression. Iâ€™d like to think itâ€™s the reason Iâ€™ve slowed down on my drinking but I canâ€™t make that conclusion yet.

My pets, friends, family and fiancee can't come, so I don't know if I'll ever see them again.  I can't stop panicking and burying myself in my dogs.

alcoholism,,"1 year Sober today. The Good and the Bad. Hey! I'm pretty new here. As the headline reads. I haven't had a drink for a year today. 
I'm pretty pleased with myself. I'd been to detox hospital and Rehab for 4 and a half months before for drink and various drugs. Lasted nearly 2 years that time. That was a long time ago. This time last year i noticed most of the few people around me weren't drinking. I was, usually pretty soon after i woke up and until i passed out. I did nothing else really. Sat at home ill and drunk and miserable so decided to try again. 
 Anyway.. i slowed down, got some extra anxiety meds and spent a few weeks feeling awful at home. 
I know you shouldn't do it that way and wouldn't recommend it but I felt I couldn't put my family through me disappearing for another long stay away sorting myself out. 
Some good things to come out of it are, 
Though i live alone and am never at 100% health I have manage to see the people closest to me a bit more.
I wake up and can get up (not always immediately but i never could), 
I eat food.. sometimes really nice food too that i cook! 
I still like staying in the majority of the time but i have a better outlook on it. I choose what i do and make better decisions.
I learned mindfulness and meditation. 

There's probably more.. but people don't often talk about the bad points of giving up so i have a few.

Those people you got wasted with before either aren't as fun to be around or we had nothing in common other than getting wasted in the first place.

It is harder to be social. People drink anywhere and most of my hobbies (that i rediscovered last time i quit) involve a drinking culture so I've had to either change how i approach the hobbies or stop them all together. Also a lot of the reasons i drunk are still there. Social anxiety etc..

This one is on me, but i substituted drinking for chocolate therefore putting on weight. Everyone needs some sort of vice right? .. I see it as a treat. In the next year I'm going to change that for light exercise instead.

Putting up with others when they're drunk is awkward. People change after a few drinks. Not being on the same ride is hard.

Drinking culture is a thing, it probably always will be. 
People seem to drink to be able to put up with being around others in otherwise boring situations. There are a lot of them.

Being consumed with temptation is another thing that comes and goes albeit less frequently as time goes on. (Mindfulness really helps here). 

People i haven't seen for a long time assume I'm the same person i was when drinking. Have felt concern, looked down upon, pity and all sorts from others. It's quite hard to know people still feel that way, when i know I'm better. 

Sleeping is hard when you have always knocked yourself out. Frustrating at first but though it hasn't got much better. Netflix is good for that!

This is long and no one has probably made it to the end. Just a few thoughts i felt like getting written down. Kind of therapy ha ha. 
If anyone can relate, great. Anyone got any similar feelings be great to hear them! 
What did you change? Was there any things you had thought it'd be like and it wasn't? Are you working on quitting now? 
On the whole things are better. A lot is the same, there's new problems but i can handle life a little better and at least see things for how they are and am able to step back and look at life with a clear head. I feel like I have a part of me missing, but i have new parts unlocked! 
I'm going to carry on with it. Hope you're doing well and thanks for giving me a pkace to write. Peace"

alcoholism,,"Need advice on how to get my dad checked out My dad has always been a heavy drinker. Heâ€™s currently 50. Heâ€™s always been a good dad, always held down a job, nothing to complain about in that aspect. Took custody of my 2 siblings and me when him and my mom divorced. Thatâ€™s how good of a dad he is. 

Anyways, Iâ€™m worried most about his health. He had periods in the past where heâ€™d drink every day of the week (when he got divorced). Half a 30 pack a day. He only drinks beer. I donâ€™t know how much he drinks now, but itâ€™s way less than he used to which is good. Probably 1 or 2 days a week and half a 30 pack. 

I just canâ€™t see how his liver has maintained all that abuse for all those years and I really want him to have it checked out by a doctor. Heâ€™s a real stubborn and proud person and we donâ€™t really ever talk about it. Iâ€™ve tried before. I think maybe he knows the outcome wonâ€™t be good so he tries to not think about it. I donâ€™t know. It literally breaks my heart knowing it might just up and fail one day. Any advice on how to get him to go to the doctor?"

POST EXCUSES"
alcoholism,,"I recently realized I may have a problem Long story short Im trying not to type out a novel.

Iâ€™ve been a pretty heavy drinker for several years now. I never thought of my habits as a problem until recently. I was talking with a girl whom I had dated for about 2 years and was trying to reconnect with. I vaguely remember her being extremely disappointed in me and saying she didnâ€™t want to talk to me again. I vaguely remember because I was pretty hammered at the time. That really did it for me. I pushed away someone who loved and cared for me more than anyone ever has in my life, besides my father. 

That really was an enlightening moment for me. Im saddened by the fact that I canâ€™t talk to her anymore, and even more saddened by the fact I canâ€™t even remember specifically what she said the last time we talked. Despite that Iâ€™m thankful for what she did. If it werenâ€™t for her breaking my heart I would have never realized the destructive path I was on. I looked back on the last few years and realized that days where I have not had booze were few and far in-between. 

So, I decided to make a change... for about a week and then I blacked out again. Which Iâ€™m honestly glad I did. It made me realize the benefits of sobriety even just a week of it far outweighs the destructive behavior I had. So, I need to stay on a good path. 

So hereâ€™s attempt number 2 at sobriety, and Iâ€™m feeling better than I have in a long time."
alcoholism,,"Reservations about being an alcoholic/addict. So I use to be all about getting messed up with alcohol and pills mostly. I went to treatment, then I went to AA regularly for about a year. I got bored of AA and have since been drinking occasionally. As of right now I drink socially about once a week. I donâ€™t do any illegal drugs and my mind is not hyper focused on getting messed up all the time. The problem I always had with AA is that you are either an alcoholic or you are not. There is no grey area with these people. I think I truly lay somewhere inbetween, which makes me not a true alcoholic. My problem with drugs was solved by a combination of relocating myself, treatment, and meetings. If you address the things wrong in your life that make you want to use, you will lose that urge to use. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a true alcy/addict"
alcoholism,,"I was walking to the liquor store As an alcoholic without a car does,

And on the way I was contemplating the human condition and all the contradictions in the rules we set up for ourselves.

Like lying.
We all lie right?
If you say you donâ€™t youâ€™re lying alright.

But when we catch someone lying we all publicly ridicule them!

Like wow what a weirdo who would lie like that?

As I was thinking about that I reached the liquor store and someone was leaving the store as I was about to enter.

He easily could have held the door for me;

You know thereâ€™s like a rule about holding a door?

If youâ€™re 10 feet away from me I wonâ€™t hold the door open, unless your old or hot.

I mean theyâ€™re the same thing right? Anyone else with me? Anyone else sucking old dudes dicks or am I alone on this? Nah Iâ€™m playing, unless you guys are cool with it. Then yeah Iâ€™m fucking old people.

Anyway the rude guy at the liquor store.

He should have held the door open for me, but he didnâ€™t he just let it fall behind him without even attempting to be polite.

To add insult to injury I happened to address him right before he let go of the door,

I said good morning!
Yes morning I drink in the morning 
Iâ€™m an alcoholic.

He said nothing AND didnâ€™t hold the door open!

Now when it comes to manners Iâ€™m kinda anal about it.

So I was fuming in the liquor store 
I bought 2 pints of vodka walked home and the whole walk I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about the rude guy at the liquor store.

I realized something

What if the guy was deaf?
What if his mom died that day?
What if his kids died that day?
What if he was just diagnosed with brain cancer?

Hmmmmm

Nah I donâ€™t care if all those things happened that day,
You still hold the door for people.

Itâ€™s common courtesy!

Iâ€™m 21 he was at least 50.

I thought our generation was supposed to be the rude unappreciative ones? Thatâ€™s what I always here but honestly most the rude people I meet are older. 

I get it, Iâ€™m using anecdotal evidence to prove a point about differences in the generations, which in it of itself is asinine. But Iâ€™m drunk so fuck it. 

But I also get why older people might be more agitated than younger folk.

The older I get the more cynical I become, however I donâ€™t appreciate older folks trying to flip the script on us like weâ€™re the assholes.

Nice try boomers I see you! ðŸ‘€"
alcoholism,,"Can I quit without AA? I know I need to stop drinking. The amount I drink isnâ€™t immediately dangerous to my body (usually 3-4 drinks 5 to 6 days a week). Occasionally I go on a bender and have more. Sometimes I take a break for a few days. But I do it alone. And in secret. And sometimes I turn into an asshole. I try going more than a few days, but itâ€™s like picking up a crutch when walking on a healing foot gets too sore. 

I know my relationship with alcohol is unhealthy, toxic, and needs to end. I am an alcoholic because of the relationship with alcohol, not due to the volume of drink. 

Thing is I read the 12 steps. I disagree with quite a bit of it. I am an adamant atheist who thinks that God is a dangerous construct. I am very glad it works so well for so many people, but it isnâ€™t something I want to be involved with. Also I am a major introvert with a very social and people oriented job. It leaves me exhausted and needing quiet, non-social time. 

Has anyone sobered up without AA? Are there any good resources to get help that donâ€™t involve going somewhere a few nights a week?"
alcoholism,,"My brother was murdered and now I'm one month sober On January 9th, the person I love the most was murdered. He was nineteen. We were really close, so he knew about my alcoholism. He saw me at my worst, absolutely wasted day after day. He was worried about the affects it was having on my mental and physical health. He always encouraged me to get sober. I wanted to get sober too, but as we all know, it's not easy. I've struggled with getting sober really heavily for the past eight months, and had made some progress. But, when he was murdered I knew I had to be done. I couldn't allow myself to cope with all this grief with alcohol. He wouldn't have wanted it, neither would the people who love me.
The night my brother was murdered, I broke down and went to the liquor store. I got drunk that night, but the next day I poured out any remaining alcohol and swore to get sober. I'm really proud to say I'm one month sober. Its been a real struggle, and I still get urges. But it's gotten easier to manage, and now I can honestly say I cant wait to continue to be sober. I can't wait to get my shit together and do all the things my brother and I talked about. Even before this happened, I didn't think I'd be able to be sober this long. Now I can't believe not only am I a month sober, I did it during this hardest period of my life. You are always so much stronger than you think you are."
alcoholism,,"Pushing the boundaries Hey guys. I'm in a bit of trouble. I drink every day, and quite alot. When I don't drink withdrawals make me feel awful. Almost 3 years ago someone told me I have a problem. But kind of ignored it.

I have managed to hold onto my career but have lost a friend or 2 and suffered a few injuries along the way. 

Currently I'm suffering terrible anxiety with my best friend, whom I also really like aswell becoming more and more distant.

I've tried tapering off, but in my industry it's hard. I work in the ski industry, doing Northern and Southern winters, and drinking comes part of the lifestyle. Don't get me wrong I love my job but might not have one by this time next year.

Not only does it suck being hungover all the time, but financially crippling aswell."

alcoholism,,"I need some third-party advice. Hello,

I apologize if this isnâ€™t an appropriate topic, Iâ€™m just seeking advice. 

I suddenly became disabled last year, lost my career and agency from it and have had to move back in with my parents while I receive medical treatment and fight to regain my life. 

My younger brother (32) has never moved out of my parents house and has been an alcoholic since he was 17. My parents have done all manner of things from therapy to inpatient to try and help him to no avail. Recently, he called our mother a cunt. This is totally unacceptable.

I went to confront him about it (and was naturally angry) and while verbally I should have handled it better, it ended up with him beating me until I was on the ground (and he kept kicking me in the face and chest even when I was trying to get away to save my life.) He was drunk, as per usual. The police came, saw how badly beaten I was, and filed felony domestic assault charges against him. This was 3 days after Iâ€™d had a seizure, fallen and sustained a traumatic brain injury, so he knew I was extraordinarily weak.

My parents are begging me not to press charges, and have already pressured me into writing letters to the prosecutor and calling them multiple times. My therapist says that he needs to face consequences, real ones, to finally make a change. 

I donâ€™t know what to do.

Any advice? I love my brother, but he just does the bare minimum to get by in any situation and I donâ€™t want to live in fear... his bedroom is a door from mine. Sober, heâ€™d never hurt me, but heâ€™s rarely sober and drunk, heâ€™s capable of such evil words and deeds. I worry as my parents age, that he could be abusive to him and I just canâ€™t tolerate the thought."
alcoholism,,"help me I just had a really bad night. I blacked out. I don't know if something happened to me or not i don't know and it's destroying me rn. I keep asking my friends and they have nothing to tell me. I have two ideas in my head. One is embarrassing. The other is traumatic. There was just moments in the night where i was unaccounted for. I'm sore now. Something happened, but i dont know what and noone has answers and it's killing me. I'm writing this hungover. 

My friends drink and do drugs. I do the same. Will I have to leave them to get sober? How do I get away from this habit.

Also, have any of you blacked out and felt really shitty afterwards? Can you describe it for me cause I want to know if I'm feeling bad about blacking out or if I just went through something traumatic. How do i get through this? Do i just say, ""Oh I was rlly drunk,"" and suppress this moment in my life? Or do I have to face not knowing?"
alcoholism,,"Considering finally leaving for real Hoping to get some support, maybe some advice. Excuse my incoherence, this is the first time I'm trying to summarize my situation like this and I'm keeping the story intentionally vague.

I've been with my current partner for over a year. We moved together few months into the relationship. They had their flaws, but I believed that they genuinely wanted and tried to fix the worst ones and we even got engaged. I've never had a relationship with a stable person, so I thought this is just normal partnership issues. They have a child from previous relationship which I gradually started taking care of and got attached to. Even though I've always feared having a child of my own, I could finally imagine it I could do it and it would even be great with this partner. They had a rough life, are diagnosed with a mental disorder and are in the process of detaching from their toxic family (which is a source of stress). I've started therapy and due to having to deal with my partner, I think I've become a better person, more understanding and tolerant, less egotistical.

The biggest issue is that they're an alcoholic. They know it, and since that one drunk night when they called off the engagement, they realized it's really an issue and they've started specialized therapy. But they make mistakes. I've been multiple times seconds away from ending it, but we always made it through somehow. Every time they drank, I had some excuse for them or they managed to say or do something that gave me hope. But lately I've been feeling like they're just going in circles and repeating the same mistake again and again.

I'm away for the weekend to visit my family. I asked my partner beforehand if they needed me to stay with them, but they said it's okay. We were texting the first night, they said they were struggling, but managing. Second day around noon, they text me they had failed and they understand if I want to move out. It did hurt, but after chilling out, I wrote they're a dummy and one well handled failure is not such a big deal. We had a really nice discussion about how they feel and everything seemed fine. They said they're getting someone to babysit to be able to relax and focus on their wellbeing. I voiced my concern about them being alone. They said they're not planning to touch alcohol. Then in the evening, they stopped responding to my texts (but they did read them). I'm almost certain they're having a drink night.

So here I am, so deep into the night it's almost morning and I can't sleep, my heart keeps beating like I just ran a mile, and I'm thinking through getting an apartment, wondering where I'm gonna live and store my stuff in the meantime, dreading being asked what happened by people I know, and trying to convince myself I'm not gonna stay alone for the rest of my life.

My partner says they love me and want me, but it's not enough for them to genuinely want to quit. We talked about that yesterday and it seemed like they were decided and excited to find their own way, but I don't feel I can take any more. I'm so angry, thinking of telling them they can't ever get any better if keep making such basic mistakes, telling them they'll lose their child this way and many more hurtful things."
alcoholism,,"Looking for some support. 4 months clean, no steps, no support system. I've emotionally crashed recently and the past few days have been incredibly difficult. I've all but convinced myself to go to the liquor store and start boozing again. BUT I HAVEN'T, yet. I did buy some red bulls, which were my customary gin chaser, in preparation.. but I'm still at home with no alcohol. 

This is the longest I've ever been without a drink and my attempts to quit have been on and off for two or so years. I don't work the steps and I don't have a sponsor/support system so basically I've come here for words of encouragement or someone to tell me to wise the fuck up. 

I don't entirely trust myself at this point so I'm looking towards the community I guess."

I have a good job that pays well and I never mix work with alcohol.

Iâ€™m not a violent drunk and the only issue I have is sometimes I canâ€™t get it up to perform with my girlfriend or Iâ€™m hung over the next day and it keeps me from going to the gym.

I know what Iâ€™m doing is bad but in my head I keep telling myself itâ€™s ok because it doesnâ€™t interfere with anything. 

I need some motivation from this community to show me that I need to cut down my drinking. Some facts of personal stories or health facts. Thank you."
alcoholism,,Does it sound like I have a problem? Confused and worried Hi friends. Iâ€™ve never considered myself to be an alcoholic. I can go weeks without drinking. When I DO drink itâ€™s usually in a party setting. I drink until I black out. This past weekend I blacked out in the middle of a nightclub. My sister found me trying to get inside the house. I was screaming crying and laughing. I finally fell asleep and wouldnâ€™t wake up. I woke up in my own vomit and pee. Should I just quit alcohol all together? This isnâ€™t the first time it happens.

alcoholism,,"Alcohol Abuse Iâ€™ve been seeing the psychiatrist for depression issues. Only did I found out today that I wasnâ€™t getting life insurance (I believe thatâ€™s what it was) and it list the diagnosisâ€™s from the doctorâ€™s notes. The thing that got to me was alcohol abuse in the diagnosis list. I ripped up the mail and threw it away so no one else can see it.

I never considered to have a problem. I have alcoholics in my family and I wasnâ€™t like them with the drinking from when you wake up till bedtime. The rage and all of that.

However, looking back, it was going to grow into a bigger problem. I wouldnâ€™t drink for relaxation or for the taste. I would drink to get drunk.

I havenâ€™t been drinking due to paranoia of mixing with my medicines (thank you OCD for making me paranoid enough for that). I havenâ€™t been counting days or anything. I know itâ€™s been awhile. Probably a couple months or more.

I havenâ€™t been craving it honestly. Iâ€™ve been honestly avoiding situations. Every weekend a group of people I hang around tend to drink. Itâ€™s really not fun hanging around drunk people while sober. Also, they will try to entice me to drink with them. So I havenâ€™t been going.

Last night as i was about to have my usual tequila/seltzer, out of nowhere i decided to put it down. cracked open a fresh seltzer and drank just water all night. I didn't overheat for the first time in forever, i didn't vomit, i didn't wake up with a major headache or feel sore. I'm going to try and keep going with this sober thing, at least with the booze.

I took responsibility for my past decisions though and they're constant reminders of why to stay sober which was going well until she returned into my life. I've finally got myself under control the last couple years and without support which sucked. My parent however has not learned a single thing or has taken responsibility for anything in her life even now in her fifties. Not even a month out of rehab recently(one of the best here and post graduation professional help offered) and shes as bad as ever and has tried dragging me down along several times already which she succeeded in twice. It's gotten to the point where our family gatherings are done in secret cause no one wants to deal with her causing a drunk scene which also means we can't invite the one sibling who still supports her either cause of the same drama.

Hello folks,

I joined this subreddit with the distinct aim of trying to understand my good friend better. I'll call him  Miles for now. 

I've known Miles for about 24 months. He was introduced to me by a mutual friend at a house party we were hosting. He was wildly drunk and out of control. We had a good laugh at his expense (not proud of this but that's the truth.) Whenever I'd hang out with my mutual friend, he'd bring Miles along. I didn't pay much attention to him to be fair, though did enjoy his company when he wasn't too disruptive.

Fast forward to 14 months ago. Our mutual friend's leukemia came back, he didn't last long. About  3 weeks in hospital till he died. A big shock for all of us and our community. I made it a resolution of mine to get to know Miles better. Our friend brought us together for a reason and I intend to honour it. 

I started playing DnD about 2 years ago. I started a campaign with Miles, his girlfriend and another friend. All 4 of us knew our friend who passed on and in a way this was our chance to become closer, honour our friend's memory and stay connected. It worked! After a year of playing, these 3 people have become really close friends of mine. They all have a place in my heart now, next to the love for our friend who has passed on. 

During our DnD sessions, Miles has been drinking (sometimes very drunk), caused problems and made other invited players uncomfortable. I tolerated it for a while, not really knowing how to navigate this behaviour. Now I am quite firm, if he gets too drunk and wants to continue drinking, we stop playing. I am very open with this to Miles. He loves DnD, it quickly became one of his favourite hobbies (and he doesn't have many.) Again, I'm not certain if this is the 'right' attitude to have. Once or twice, Miles has stayed and I've helped sober him up and continue playing. Other times we just finish early and go our own ways for the evening, normally we're all disgruntled and would have loved to continue playing though it's a line I'm not willing to cross anymore. 

I have a small side business growing herbs and teaching about their medicinal uses. Miles has come over to help me quite a few times and I've even paid him in cash/herbs for the work before. He's expressed an interested in learning some of my social skills (his main draw to drinking is because of social anxiety.) I can hold myself quite well in many awkward situations and have quite a calming presence when needed. 

He gave up drinking recently just before Christmas. He's expressed an interest in giving up multiple times. Tried AA, anti-psychotics etc. We asked him as friends if there was anything we could do to support him during the upcoming NY party to remain sober but he asked for 'no special treatment.' His sobriety lasted 3 weeks, with him drinking at NYs and not stopping afterwards. I've been away for 6 weeks now visiting family and he hasn't stopped since. 

When I come back (at the end of Feb) I want to try again and meet him on his level to help him quit drinking. A big motivation for him quitting in December was not to upset 'his new friends.' I was touched to be considered one of those people.

My questions to all of you out there:

\- How to navigate it when Miles doesn't want to talk about/draw attention to his addiction. How can I create space to discuss this with him? When he gave up recently, I asked him how many days he'd been sober. For me (having my own journey with addictions to video games), days of sobriety are something to celebrate and cheer about every damn day. Mile's response to my question was 'I don't want to think about it'. Knowing that counting the days can be a great tool for overcoming addictions, I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to someone not wanting to engage in this positive behaviour. Can I celebrate this with him without the shame or guilt that could come with it?

\- What was it that gave you the most support from your closest friends? I'm going to propose something to Miles when I come back: A regular time slot to come and help me work with my herbs. During this time I'd like to introduce him to meditation, maybe go running together, get lunch together. This is all something I'm willing to pay him for his time with me. 

\- I'm scared for Miles. He's drunk himself to the point of having seizures. I've said to his face I'm worried about him dying soon, that I can hear his clock ticking faster than those around me. Was this too direct? Too harsh?

I love this guy. He is a damn good role player too. Any advice would be appreciated. If you feel I've been on my high horse or too righteous in some of the things I've written - please let me know. 

I have a lot to share about navigating anxiety by using herbal remedies. If there's interest, let me know and I'll share with you all one day.

Peace and love to you all and your journeys

alcoholism,,"I am ruining my life bit by bit, and I am determined to stop drinking.  

This feels silly writing, especially as you're all strangers and I've never actually looked to a community (or even any single person) for help with my problems. However, I think this may be a reason why I've been having the issues that I do.

I am ruining my relationship with my girlfriend of 13 years because of how combative, stupid and sensitive (yet simultaneously insensitive) I become when I drink. I have no off switch, so even when I intend just to have a few beers, I end up going out and drinking 12 or more pints by the end of the night, starting some stupid shit, embarrassing myself and waking up feeling like a moron and trying to reconstruct what the hell I did the night before.

I've reached my breaking point, and I can no longer justify drinking AT ALL because sooner or later it turns out the same way all over again. I'm quitting drinking entirely, and I don't have anyone to talk to about this in my personal life, because I've kept my drinking problem private (for the most part).

I don't really know what to say other than Hello, and that I hope I can look back on this post in a few months, and then again in a few years and finally point to the moment where I said ""Full Fucking Stop"" and got myself and my life back under my own control.

Thanks for reading. Any links, tips or advice would be greatly appreciated."
alcoholism,,"What's the best way to help someone and when to know to stop. My ex bf is a wonderful man but he has a real problem drinking. He is what I've come to know as a high functioning alcoholic. I got wrapped up in the drama for a bit, then I realized how serious the problem was and how deep the denial was planted. He has created a whole life around drinking. His father was apparently an abusive alcoholic and it seems he was emotionally abandoned as a child. A few of our mutual friends have hinted towards a problem but he seems to push all his non-alcoholic/non-enabler friends away. Looking at the situation now I can see I may have been one of a few people in his life that was holding him accountable. Guess how that worked out!? He dumped me because I was concerned and didn't approve of his behavior when drinking. There's been some times he's mentioned it was a problem but nothing stuck long enough to want to change. Would getting some other concerned friends for an intervention help? I really feel bad but worry the denial is so deep it's just gonna isolate him more. It feels helpless, what do you fine folks think? What would you have wanted to someone to do/say, (if anything). Seems like doing nothing is no help but I don't want to turn my back on someone I care for! Advice greatly appreciated! Thank you and so proud of everyone who has fought so hard to get clean and share your stories!"
alcoholism,,With I get withdrawal or is it still a hangover? Am I just recovering from a hangover or am I in withdrawal? I had a 4 night binge. Each night I had 10 beers exactly. Iâ€™m female 26 190 pounds. Itâ€™s been 20 hours since my last drink
alcoholism,,"Where to start? Thank you in advance. Hi everyone. A little background about me to start I suppose. Iâ€™m male, 23, married to a lovely wife. I never used to really drink before I was 21. Iâ€™d been to the occasional high school/college party but nothing crazy. 21st birthday I went way overboard (as most do) and pretty much swore off alcohol because of how sick I felt all night. I couldâ€™ve sworn I was dying. 

I didnâ€™t drink much after my 21st. The occasional drink or 2 Iâ€™d buy at the convenience store to have while playing Xbox with friends. And then something changed. I donâ€™t remember when it started, but I started getting drinks every night. And then getting drinks every night turned into getting drunk every night. And then getting drunk every night turned to passing out drunk on the couch every night. 

At the time of writing this, I havenâ€™t drank in 2 days. Itâ€™s not much, but itâ€™s a start. Before today the longest I think Iâ€™ve gone in a year is 3-4 days, and usually because I was out of town.

I just want to learn to control myself. I donâ€™t know why but I always feel tempted to get drunk once evening comes around, even if the same morning I felt terrible and said I wouldnâ€™t. 

So thereâ€™s my story so far. I welcome any advice that anyone has. Thank you for taking the time to read."
alcoholism,,"Today I am admitting I have a problem This is very hard for me.  I am 42 years old, have two amazing kids, an engaged to an amazing man and my drinking leaves me in a constant state of misery.  So bad that I hardly value my own life.  I donâ€™t mean that I want to kill myself but I know the implications of the drinking and I continue regardless.  I average 5-7 drinks per night.  Itâ€™s caused me to gain 15 lbs in a little over a year.  My fiancÃ© has to know thereâ€™s a major issue and some days I wish he would just say it or confront me about it but he doesnâ€™t.  I need to change my life.  I canâ€™t go to a local AA because of my high profile job in a small town.  I need this to end or I feel like it will kill me.  I donâ€™t even know where to start.  Thank you for listening!"
alcoholism,,"Is binge-drinking the same thing as alcoholism? So i can go weeks, sometimes even a month or two without wanting or needing a drink. 

However i always feels like im missing something and not really having that much fun. 

So when i do drink, i really do feel like i drink to feel emotions the way i used to. This normally means im drinking past the point of safety. 

Im not a particularly violent drunk. Ive never been in a fight but i do know that i can get a little creepy and handsy. This last bit absolutely mortifies me as I grew up as the only guy in an all female household so im incredibly ashamed of myself for making girls uncomfortable. 

I donâ€™t know if anyone else is like this or has a similar problem. But just wanted to know if there is someone I could talk to."

alcoholism,,"Feeling really stressed out from family members addictions I have two family members with severe addictions. One is to hard drugs and one is an alcoholic. They are somehow still alive but have almost died many times each. It's actually amazing they're alive.

I can't really talk about it to other people because everyone has their own issues and I don't want to stress with them with mine. I'm also having a hard time with my own life right now so dealing with them is really stressing me out. Their binges sometimes result in really crazy things happening that makes me feel like I'm in a suspense or horror film. We can't cut them out of the family because they will die but at the same time it feels like swimming with a bag of rocks tied to you.

alcoholism,,"Experience/advice on recently quitting and problems with bowel movements - help may sound a bit gross...I started tapering down from 1 liter/day last Friday and on Monday morning had a final malt liquor at 7AM. Unfortunately I have been having to make a dump every 1-2 hours since then and my butt is really sore now from all the wiping. This happens overnight as well. All the other withdrawal symptoms (aside from insomnia) seem to be gone. Has anybody come across similar problems during their first week sober? For example - I have been awake less than four hours this morning and already been there three times and each time there is a good deposit left to flush. 

I have no idea what I'm doing so yesterday went and bought bananas, mango, apples and avocado. I had been ordering fast food or restaurant food recently. I'm not deterred from keeping sober, just want a more comfortable way to make it through this. Any advice is appreciated."

alcoholism,,"Ideas for helping recovering friend Hi everyone, my best friend is currently at a rehab facility that doesnâ€™t allow electronics (this is not his first rodeo, but the first without electronics), and unfortunately we are now 5.5 hours away, I always work on the days designated as â€œfamily days,â€ and I work evenings/nights, so the times that he can call me, I usually canâ€™t answer :(. I will end up visiting him, but itâ€™s been so hard to make it work, and obviously it canâ€™t be a weekly thing. He says he understands, but it still makes me sad because I feel Iâ€™m not being as supportive as I want to be this time around because I havenâ€™t really been able to see/communicate with him aside from letters weâ€™ve been sending back and forth by mail. This last relapse was also pretty bad so I want to be there as much as I can even if I canâ€™t *be* there.

I was thinking to surprise him with a nice book, but I donâ€™t know if I should pick something thatâ€™s similar to his current situation/what heâ€™s been through/going through. If I went that route, I was thinking to send The Lost Weekend by Charles Jackson, however, I have never experienced addiction myself, and heâ€™s mentioned that at rehab theyâ€™ve watched â€œtriggeringâ€ movies recently, and I donâ€™t want to end up making it hard for him by triggering him. I also donâ€™t know if self-help books would help/be interestingâ€”heâ€™s doing stuff all day in the â€œself-helpâ€ category, so I wonder, is that really a good gift to give? (If it actually is, please let me know!)

Alternately, I could send him random books that I like that I think he will too, but I canâ€™t think of anything with that overall *hopeful* theme Iâ€™m going for at the moment. 

I guess Iâ€™m asking for advice on what to send/what to avoid and suggestions for helpful gifts of all kinds if at all possible. Thank you in advance and good luck to all of you on your journeys!"
alcoholism,,"Panic Attack While Drinking I used to binge drink EVERY weekend for two years. I never drank during the weekdays, (I did for a week straight after my 21st) but it was usually to the point where I blacked out or near blacked. So it was a LOT. However, I drank one night and I was pretty hungover the day after. While I was hungover, I was pregaming for something, I barely drank anything and I had a panic attack. I had to have my friend grab me and help me outside because I was not feeling good. I was able to act normally shortly after but, ever since then, Iâ€™ve felt slightly anxious in certain social settings. I only drank one point after that (it was 4-5 months after) and, while I didnâ€™t feel as anxious, I felt dizzy, my heart started beating out of my chest, and I needed to go outside. I just want to know, is there any symptom like this? Will I ever recover?

Women have impossible standards. Its as if you must be perfect in every way under the sun or no shot. AA ""promises"" never happen. Nothing good does. Counselors in hospitals claim that feeling hopeless and like nothing will get better is a ""disease"". Maybe it is for some, but for many it is simply nothing more than realizing the painfully brutal truth. Its not a disease. Neither is being suicidal. Thoughts."

alcoholism,,"Is this due to quitting alcohol or something else? I really slowed down drinking about 4 weeks ago and then totally stopped 2 weeks ago.   
I've been feeling kinda sick since then, can't seem to go to bed before 2-3 am, and always wake up around 7-8am unable to fall back asleep.   
I'm a student so I always feel pretty stressed but now it's at a whole new level, like I feel sickly all the time and have a really hard time keeping focus.   


I didn't drink every day but when I did it would be around 4-8 pints 2-3x a week, this is what made me want to stop drinking, I felt I couldn't stop myself once I started. But at this level, there shouldn't be any withdrawal right? And definitely shouldn't last over a month?   


Part of my thinks I was overly dependent on it to de-stress and now my body doesn't know what to do.  
Another part of me thinks it could be due to social isolation, I study an extreme introverted field and don't have any friends outside of school setting. Hitting the neighborhood pub was my main social outlet. Now I only have about 15 min of social interaction per week.   


Any thoughts/recommendations on this?"

He had been consistently getting black out drunk and peeing himself every night for at least a week and has been an alcoholic all my life. It generally never got this bad and when it did it was a one off thing that everyone forgot with time. Something has to change.

I don't really know what to do. I do a very full time course (\~45hrs per week) and I do have a part-time job but it doesn't pay enough to support myself. I have sent out babysitting and dog walking flyers to try and make some more money but I don't know how I'm going to survive.

I've tried to talk to my mom about this and told her that I don't want to be completely sober I just need to cut down. I told her that I have it under control. She said to try to only have a drink on the weekends which sounds easy, but it's just not. I don't know why it's so hard to just NOT drink. I drink excessively knowing I have problem and I can't keep doing this to my mind and body. I confide in my mom about a lot of things but this is a sensitive subject because her dad was an alcoholic, my dad is struggling, and I don't want her to worry about me. All of my close friends like to drink, and I can't admit my struggles with alcohol to my SO. I feel like I can't find the right person to talk to about this. 

For me, there is no ""only drink on the weekends"". It has to be no drinking at all. I have finally come to accept that the drinking needs to end. I need to for myself, my mom, and all of my relationships. I don't know what I would do if I ruined any of my relationships because of my excessive drinking. I honestly don't know if I can do this.

So went to the hospital, and they took blood, monitored blood pressure and oxygen. My Blood pressure was 180/102, which is extremely high. They stuck a tube down my nose/throat and found no blood. Did a rectal exam and found nothing. And did a CT scan and found nothing. So they discharged me and told me to follow up with my PCP. 

That's definitely a wake up call for sure. I'm only 33 too. I've been abusing my body for a long time, and severely the last 12 months. 

I need to quit, and get healthy. But it's so freaking hard.

alcoholism,,"An interesting turn of events I just wanted to post this because I think it's going to be interesting for some. I'll also give the following disclaimer: I am not endorsing consuming alcohol to anyone.
My back story is similar to many; lots of alcohol missuse; bouts of depression; punctuated with months of abstinence here and there. 
So, I'm a teacher and my school has arranged for very expensive life coaching/ therapy sessions where everything is open for discussion. The guy with whom I spoke was just amazing and the conversation inevitably came around to my drinking problem. Instead of addressing the alcohol directly, he took me back to the roots of my problems - being bullied as a child; staying in toxic relationships far too long to name just two examples. By using EFT (google it - it's been a game changer for me) it became possible to separate my problem drinking from the root causes. My drinking has been a symptom, not the cause of my problems - it has massively exacerbated my problems- but it's never been the root cause. So anyway, I've spent the last six months hiding away and living a super restrictive life but last night I met up with a friend and had a few beers. Today, where I would have usually binge drunk myself into oblivion for a few months before getting sober again, I feel totally 'normal'. I don't want to drink. I know I don't have to drink. Drink doesn't feel important anymore. Who knows when and if I drink again. It feels totally different, like i can just live my life without constantly thinking and reading about alcohol. For context I'm 43 and have been dealing with the booze for many years.
Again, I am NOT advising anyone to start drinking, I just would urge anyone to try and address the root causes that may have led to their alcohol misuse. Much love"
alcoholism,,"Am I an alcoholic? What constitutes crossing the line? I havenâ€™t lost my job, I take care of my responsibilities and donâ€™t drink in the morning or during any work obligations. When I drink though, I binge drink. Some days I can stick to only two drinks but it takes a lot of effort. I can go for days without a drink but Iâ€™m always looking forward to that opportunity in the next week where I can have a couple of beers.

I have a partner who I supported through several rehabs, who is now a couple of months sober. Iâ€™ve seen the torment of how alcohol can control a person but I feel like Iâ€™m not there. The deal is, when I want a couple of drinks I sleep out. I thought I could completely stop drinking but alas, a party led me to having a couple of beers over this weekend. Even though I wasnâ€™t black out drunk, stable and had a taxi on stand by, I wasnâ€™t allowed to go home, which has led me to question my behaviour.

I donâ€™t want to quit my couple of drinks with friends on occasions. My partner needs to put their recovery first and for me, I have accepted that this will lead to a break up. Iâ€™m actually okay with this because I feel suffocated by this lifestyle and still trying to get over the horrendous events during their active stage.

I do understand that I am no better than them now however I believe that I donâ€™t escalate as badly when I do drink. The more they want me to stop, the more I feel like I want to rebel against them. It makes me angry that I am being portrayed as the villain when I meet friends, which really is not a daily occurrence. I am confused whether I should start taking more steps to completely stop my once a week or two week binge. I enjoy it and I crave beers, which is making me wary and reaching out for help to you now."
alcoholism,,"My brother (24) is a very serious alcoholic. Looking for advice regarding interfacing with him. Alcohol abuse comes from 3 of our grandparents. He got it the worst, by far, out of 8 kids. He's the 5th. I'm the first. I am 10 years older than he is. I experienced similar drinking issues when I was his age, but they did not manifest in the outwardly malicious way that his are. He looks to me as a 'kindred spirit' because I drink too much, but without it having an overtly negative effect on my lifestyle or without it impeding my obligations. I am aware that some people will want to make this about my drinking, but it really isn't outside of my brother using me as a poor example to justify his own habits.

He married his high school sweetheart after impregnating her when he was a few years ago when he was 22. At that point he'd had no history of problematic drinking. By the time his daughter was born he had been hospitalized for drinking two or three times, arrested about the same number of times, and spent 30 days in VERY expensive in-patient rehab with daily psych visits. He got out and seemed to keep it together long enough to marry his wife and have his daughter. 

Since then he has been repeatedly hospitalized during drunk rampages, with levels as high as .40, which is supposedly fatal for amateur drinkers without serious tolerances. He is very talented as a drinker and has talked himself out of half a dozen circumstances where he was dead-to-rights drunk out of his mind and facing a DUI. He holds himself together in social situations the same way.

All of which is sort of fine. However, we've reached the point where he sends family group chat messages attacking my parents brutally on perceived flaws in their own lives. He attacks my mother for how he turned out and blames her, and he attacks my father for his lack of presence while he supported our large family. He says more brutally ridiculous things to them than I would ever tolerate without immediate violence from anyone else. I would rip out a stranger's throat for the things he says to my mother, which are all baseless, but which shred her emotionally. After a week or so he'll wrap up the bender and have a sick day where he seems to reflect on his texts from the week prior and apologize to everyone with a grand gesture.

We've been through this a dozen times over the past two years. I've tried being his friend and letting him relate his drinking to mine, even though that is without real merit. I've tried taking a hardline stance and ignoring him until he goes a month without an episode, but that month never comes and I break down and communicate with him again because I'm terrified of the remorse I will feel if he harms himself or someone else out of lonely desperation. He got wasted and tried and failed to hang himself with an appliance cord once already after nobody engaged his insanity.

What the fuck do I do? I don't drink with him or talk to him when I'm drinking. I have abandoned the idea of comparing my regular heavy drinking with his routine drunkenness and week-long benders. We tried to quit drinking together last year and I went 4 weeks before finding out he never quit at all. Is there anything I can do to help him? Do I just prepare myself for the upcoming tragedy? His wife is completely worthless and does nothing to fight his issues except to call us brothers or my father to deal with his violent rampages once he's gone too far. I'm at my wit's end and he's not even my brother having the worst problems with substance abuse."
alcoholism,,"Children of alcoholics Children of alcoholics,  do you think it is better to be grow up in a two parent home with an alcoholic father or with a single mother? I have a 6 year old son and 15 year old step son that are the main reasons I am staying with my alcohol addicted husband.  We don't argue and fight alot, he just goes on binges and disappears on us. Tonight he took our older son to a dance at school and told me he was coming right back home. He promised our younger son they could camp out in the livingroom tonight.  I had a gut feeling he was going to go on a binge. I could tell yesterday he was edgy and I told him he was acting like he was craving alcohol,  but he denied it.  Our 6 year old was crying and heartbroken that his dad lied to him. He kept saying he heard Daddy outside and would watch for him to walk in the door. Him making my son cry has me furious. This is inexcusable.
We are 41 and 46, so not young kids. I quit working to stay home with our kids. I have some money put aside,  but have no idea how I will work and get my son back and forth to school and childcare.  I don't have any friends or family that can help me much either. His family is no help and he is their golden child that can do no wrong. 
I just want to do what is best for my son."

D is a heavy drinker, revolves his life around drinking games and partying. Iâ€™ve reset my sobriety four times in the past year and a half, itâ€™s obviously been very difficult. When Iâ€™ve slipped into drinking again, heâ€™s my biggest supporter. He finds out Iâ€™ve broken my sobriety and gets so excited, wants to get wasted with me every time Iâ€™m around. 

When Iâ€™m sober, he tells me how lame it is, and waves drinks in my face, constantly offers. Iâ€™ve gotten use to it in the past, but this time around is different, Iâ€™m settling into a permanent sober mindset, something I havenâ€™t done before. Itâ€™s really f**king hard. 

Tonight weâ€™re hanging out, playing board games, small gathering. He found a way to turn it into a drinking game. When my boyfriend said we arenâ€™t drinking, D announced to everyone here that I Could participate, if Iâ€™d drop the sobriety act. Then yelled â€œSobriety is a joke.â€

alcoholism,,"My Dad is 30 Years Sober. My dad celebrated 30 years of sobriety on Halloween, of all nights. So my brother and I went to an AA meeting with him ([photo of him with his candle](https://www.facebook.com/events/2480731532052307/)). It was a cool experience and really special that he shared it with us.  
I'm a comedian, so,  constant travel, performing in nightclubs and getting paid in free drinks made my relationship with alcohol difficult. One night my best friend drove me home in my car while I puked out the window of the backseat. The whole time I was trying to say ""I'm sorry about this. I love you."" in between gasps of air. I drove the car to get detailed in the morning, and told the guy my friend puked to save face. It was pretty humiliating. I could keep lying to everyone but I knew the truth. Even while I was puking, I realized how annoyed my friend must be. and the next morning looking through my texts, I realized I was straining other relationships even if they weren't present at the night out.

After that night, I started writing a joke about drinking in moderation. I called it ""2 drinks is the new midnight."" -It's my dad's favorite joke and I thought I'd share it in here. Hopefully you'll get a chuckle and maybe even find some inspiration.

Iâ€™ve been hitting it pretty hard over the past year and a half and as of somewhere in the past five months, Iâ€™ve completely lost control. It all came to a head last night when I got incoherently drunk and tried to coerce my SO into doing something she didnâ€™t want to do over the phone which made her inconsolable. I then preceded to go upstairs and lose most of my motor skills. I was laying on the floor on my back when I realised that I had a small amount of vomit in my mouth, I tried to get up and go to the toilet but I was unable to stand so I decided to just swallow it and ended up choking. My SO was aware of this and had to scream at me to sit up and thankfully I did and it came out. I woke up this morning still completely wrecked and ended up being an hour late for work. Iâ€™m so ashamed of what Iâ€™ve become and even more ashamed of how I made my SO feel. Despite all of this, I still have the strong urge to drink and I canâ€™t accept the reason why.

alcoholism,,"Iâ€™m a 19 year old alcoholic Last June I went to Europe, where I got comfortable with being able to drink all the time. I had been drinking in non social- unhealthy ways up until then on and off- but now itâ€™s February. There has not been a single night since July that I havenâ€™t drank\been drunk.

alcoholism,,"My boyfriend needs help. How do I help him? I'm 23 and he's 26. He has an obvious alcohol problem. He gets drunk every other day (alone at home) when he's at his worst. He can barely manage a week without alcohol when he's at his best. 

I've tried for months to get him to book a doctor's appointment, but he's too proud and wants to manage on his own. He keeps telling me ""I'll stop drinking on weekdays and only drink on weekends"" or ""from next week, I quit drinking completely"". But then a couple days later, he falls right back into his old routine. 

He usually only drinks when I am not there, but we don't live together, so I can't be there for him every single day. When I ask him why he got drunk he will usually say something like ""I was bored"" or something. 

His drinking is a problem, especially because he has no money because he's studying. And the only money he has goes to alcohol. It is also a problem because I don't like him when he's drunk. And he sometimes misses school because he's hungover. 

How do I go about helping him? He wants to manage on his own, but he obviously can't do that. How can I help him at this point?"

alcoholism,,"Girlfriend was finally honest - need advice Iâ€™m going to try not to type a super long post but I wanted to give a little background. Over the last 2 years now, my girlfriend has been drinking in secret. It was more apparent at certain times, and may not have even been everyday of the week, but it was enough to draw some real concern from me. We got into this fucking terrible cycle of me noticing her acting different, accusing her of drinking, her denying it, me finding the alcohol, fighting, and then repeating the same scenario about every 4-8 weeks. Iâ€™ve become a detective that specializes in alcohol, and I hate it. I hate feeling like Iâ€™m invading her privacy, finding the alcohol, and above all, being blamed for her having to hide her drinking. 

She would tell me things like â€œif I wasnâ€™t so judgmental, that she wouldnâ€™t have to hide itâ€ and plenty of other things along those lines. Never did she come to me and admit her secret drinking was unhealthy and abnormal - until yesterday. 

She broke down, confided some things in me about how sheâ€™s been feeling and some past trauma she dealt with, and finally said, â€œI know my drinking isnâ€™t normal, I was scared to acknowledge it bc then I would know I had a problemâ€. She then asked me for help. 

I feel like this is a huge step, and it took a ton for her to say that. I need advice on where to go from here though. I obviously canâ€™t do it all. How do I help her? I really need some advice besides â€œgo to AAâ€

alcoholism,,"Is my father suicidal or helplessly by blood/genetics an alcoholic So long story short, successful business man with money to buy anything and a relatively easy life ( works from home ) but since I was about 7 years old ( my mother and him divorced when I was 6, with 15 years of marriage behind them. According to her he never drank for fun or had drinking binges ever ) 

He has a new partner since who loves him and tries to keep him away from alcohol. Well anyways, since I was around 7 he would get drunk for a few days in a row, not do anything but just sleep and drink/watch TV and he'd snap out of it. Many holidays were spent with him drunk for a week straight. 

Over the years it got worse where hed be drunk 2-3 weeks straight with a few months between Everytime and two of those binges over the past 3 years landed him in the hospital from alcohol withdrawal. Last binge was 1.5 years ago which was the 2nd hospitalization and he's been sober since.

 Despite the apologies and realising he's a moron who almost got himself killed, now suddenly after a business trip he's drinking again with the mindset that he's not gonna stop. He even asked my brother to go buy him a 6 pack the other day cause his fiancee and my brother threw all the alcohol out. I'm 21 btw and my brother a few years younger 


Is it possible he has some sort of long term depression that he deals with by binging every few months or does he just miss the drink that much? I know this wasn't too detailed but insight would be appreciated."
alcoholism,,"72 hours without a drink I am 72 hours without alcohol. I'm very proud of myself and really want to go a week or more.

10+ year daily heavy drinker but functional. Could get up, go to work etc. I have never gone more than a day without a drink in the last 10/12 years.
I also drink a ton of water on a daily basis.

As proud as I am I read online stuff about the benefits of quitting and it scares the shit out of me! At this point, I feel fine! Slightly ""foggy"" if you will, I also have had nothing to eat today.

Can I expect the crazy withdrawl symptoms that I read about? Or could I be an exception?"
alcoholism,,"I'm at the end of my rope - what can I do? Throwaway here, looking for advice, or commiseration, or something. I suppose I am a functioning 33 year old alcoholic - That is to say I have a job, I pay my bills, my kids are fed and my house is not a complete disaster. I keep trying to taper off of alcohol, or quit cold-turkey. I don't know that I've ever experienced any of the serious effects of withdrawal. The worst part for me is the anxiety and mood swings, the lack of sleep and feeling very tired all the time. Mind you, I haven't gone more than 2 full days without it in the past 6 years. Drinking has been problematic for much longer, back to my early 20s.

I also have this issue that I'm sure a lot of you experience. If you cut back on the alcohol, you just find another substance to abuse. Benzos, weed, sleeping pills. I just want to be clean and sober and able to function. I'm in my mid-30s with heightened liver enzymes, told I am developing a fatty liver years ago. I'm sure it's worse now. High blood-pressue. Unable to cope with life without something coursing through my veins.

It seems whenever I give in and get back to accepting my drinking, I get worse instead of better. I need it to alleviate my anxiety, for sure. I have always had an issue with anxiety and depression. In fact, I've never been able to hold down a full-time job for more than a few months at a time before developing a drinking problem. Not since a traumatic event in my early 20s made any issue I had many times worse. Booze helps me get to work and function. Prescription medication never helped as much as the alcohol has. 

I also enjoy drinking. I like the taste and I like the way I feel before I have too much. I like that it numbs my anxiety and feelings of the world being utter shit. I think it used to amplify my mood swings, but I've been able to learn better ways to cope with those so I don't fly off the handle.

I suppose my interest in any hobbies I've had has largely diminished. My brain feels fuzzy at most times. I used to do stand-up, I used to be in a band, I used to make art, I used to play sports. Alcohol has added a good 50 lbs to me and made me sluggish, physically and mentally. I'm still not sure that it isn't a fair trade though, to use it as a medication in place of the plethora of prescribed ones that haven't ever helped.

What can I do?"
alcoholism,,"I think I have a drinking problem. Every week or two I find my self drinking in massive excess to the point of not remembering things and even how I got to bed or that I made food. I almost always have a few drinks every night wether it be beer cocktail or wine or all of the  above. I used the excuse for all my life â€œto go to sleepâ€ but lately once I start I find myself drinking many drinks far past the time I should even be going to bed or until I donâ€™t have an option but to go to bed. &amp; Itâ€™s not a nice have fun drink either itâ€™s a dark depressing self loathing drunk. Itâ€™s been happening almost weekly now and accelerating. 

And Iâ€™m sick of drinking away all my money. Iâ€™m quite depressed last few months / year, as depression got worse so did the drinking. I know itâ€™s shit for depression and I know itâ€™s shit for my health. 

When I stopped drinking for 7 days I lost my appetite completely, smell of food made me want to vomit only time I could eat was if I got super high and I could eat some yogurt maybe if lucky. I lost about 13 pounds in one week. I had extremely bad diarrhea body cramps etc when I went to doctor he even recommended not quitting cold turkey as it can have some pretty serious side effects apparently. 
And I broke down and started drinking again because I was too weak to the withdrawal and I am addicted. But this is getting stupid and Iâ€™m being very stupid. 
If Iâ€™m going to do this not cold turkey thing I need to get control of this because I think I do have a problem. I need to quit cold turkey and deal with withdrawal or get my head out of my ass and limit myself and eventually quit. Any advice on the topic Iâ€™d appreciate on limiting myself or how to make withdrawal a little better. Either one or maybe your own story. Regardless I need to fix this now, Iâ€™m tired of it now, Iâ€™m done with this game.

My skin is not as dry, I am just now able to get good sleep at night again, my mood swings are beginning to die down, and I have more desire to chase my hobbies like art and music. 

But.

9am to 6pm, Monday through Friday, I am now IRREVOCABLY bored at my job. Bored to tears is hardly even an understatement. I work a dead end position with no opportunity for growth and hardly anything to learn. I build spreadsheets all day. I never drank during working hours so I don't understand why it feels like I'm so bored now. Maybe I just looked forward to alcohol after work? I don't really want to quit my job, it's a great seat for me at this point in my life, I'm just so bored!

What can I do? I've tried a few things that I found online. Here's what didn't work for me: I find it impossible to find challenging situations to put myself in at work, setting objectives just makes me get done with my work too fast and I have hours of the day on my hands that I feel guilty for, there's no promotion for me to shoot for, and I typically work quick and efficiently."
alcoholism,,"Need advice. I binge drink about once a week, I party too much. I don't drink daily. I need advice and support. I don't drink every day. I don't get the shakes. I can go days or weeks without drinking. But I like partying too much. I have trouble with setting limits. Maybe 5 years ago it was more innocent and acceptable. I'm 30 now. About once a week I go out and I drink way too much, I don't pass out or puke but I certainly put myself in sketchy situations (I'm an attractive woman so I do get a lot of attention). More than anything I put myself in danger, I don't go home at the time I'm supposed to and I just end in situations that I shouldn't be in. For example, a couple of weeks ago I lost my bank card, the other night I went out my friend left and I stayed by myself (it shouldn't be but it's stupid and dangerous) and I met a guy that was in sketchy business and I feel like he could have hurt me if I stayed longer. On top of that, the next day I'm absolutely hung over and useless. That night I have trouble sleeping because I get anxiety and end up sleeping late and the following day I'm exhausted. It takes me 2/3 days to recover, thus I waste 2/3 days of my week.
The trigger is strange, I can have a casual beer with lunch and not even think twice again about it. It's just when I go partying I tend to exceed myself.
What advice can you give me? Should I just stop drinking all together? Do you have any tricks to identify your emotions and analyze them instead of just ignoring them and drown them in booze?
It's quite conflicting because I'm a foodie and knowledgeable about wine and beer, it's something I love. I will absolutely not drink something I dislike (bacardi for example) also, I've been always super fun to hang out with, dance and party. It's kind off part of my personality -sigh-
I don't know what to do."
alcoholism,,"Even if you feel like you could quit drinking, how do you get past the notion that there is literally nothing else in life that can provide any sort of satisfaction? Title kind of says it all.  I drink on average 4-6 drinks daily, but can pretty often cut myself off at 2.  Iâ€™ve started to recognize that my health is far less than perfect, the regular hangovers are debilitating, and I donâ€™t really enjoy it the way I used to.

But even in making several half-baked attempts at cutting back or stopping all together and in realizing through reading TNM that a life without alcohol is very possible, the biggest hurdle that remains is that I cannot for the life of me imagine even the rosiest of circumstances providing the sense of ease and contentment that pouring a drink does.  

Iâ€™m sorry if this post just sounds cynical, especially to those who are successfully making early strides, but I guess what Iâ€™m trying to get over is how one (especially someone whoâ€™s hardly ever known what it means to not be depressed) answers the question of â€œwhatâ€™s the point?â€ when quitting would mean a life thatâ€™s invariably just as unfulfilling but experienced in a body thatâ€™s undeniably healthier but also more cognizant of its empty existence."
alcoholism,,"My husband and went to in patient rehab tonight Today was a super emotional day to say the least ... my husband has really struggled with alcoholism &amp; binge drinking. (Something I will never understand) I have tried to be supportive during this entire thing. We have been married 5 years &amp; before we got married I had no idea about his substance abuse issues. (Previously was addicted to adderall) we just had a baby three months ago, he swore he would stop drinking when our son was born but that did not happen. 
Just like I canâ€™t imagine being an addict, I donâ€™t think the addict can imagine what itâ€™s like to love an addict. It is so hard sometimes... especially when you bring a child into the mix. (unplanned but definitely not unloved) 
He was super drunk today and his aunt and uncle were over to talk us through some things... he just admitted he will never be able to truly change until he gets actual help. He has obviously wanted to stop, he has tried to stop on his own way too many times to count, but has never been successful. So we figured out insurance, time off work &amp; all within an hour and got him packed up and dropped off to a rehabilitation center 30 minutes away. I donâ€™t even know if he will he paid for his time off. I think itâ€™s supposed to be 30 days. I canâ€™t speak to him for the first week and I think I can visit him on the weekends ... Iâ€™m just obviously used to seeing him everyday and him at least somewhat interacting and helping me with things. I know itâ€™s not forever... but 30 days seems like a lot, especially with a newborn baby. 
It was hard with him living here and being drunk every night but his presence always comforted me, he has a good heart and despite all the bad times we have good memories too. I love him and I want to see him better... better for himself, our child and me. 
I guess Iâ€™m just trying to vent, see if there are any others out there who have been through something similar and can relate. How do you get through the loneliness ? The hopelessness ? The fear. I do believe in God and Iâ€™m really trying to press in but itâ€™s only day one and I feel so sad. Have your loved ones who attended rehab stayed sober ? How have their ( or your) life changed? I understand the urge will always be there to drink as an addict but how do they stay sober after rehab?"
alcoholism,,"How can I positively support my partner M29 who is still currently struggling with alcoholism without lecturing them or scaring them away? I knew that he struggled with alcoholism in the past when I got into a relationship with him, however when faced with me letting him know that maybe he is not sober enough to drive last night at a family dinner, he got very defensive and claimed it was not my place to lecture him and I did not need to worry. I was hurt by his defensiveness and the way he was ok with distancing himself from me over alcohol. I know that it is a internal struggle for him and he has since apologized to me for getting too aggressive in our argument. After some talking he agreed we should sit and then go home to avoid him going off the deep end  (there was an open bar at this event). I am so proud of him for eventually showing reason and responsibility. However before this situation presents itself again, I need help knowing how I can support him without lecturing him, and making him feel like a bad person or that I am better than him. He seems to turn defensive very quickly even when i bring it up gently and caringly. I know it is not my job to fix him, but I care about him deeply and I want to support his growth in the right direction.

alcoholism,,"My first speech in AA ""My name is ___ and i didnt think that i was an alcoholic. When i was stabbed in the face i was drunk. When i was jumped i was drunk. When i did harm to others i was drunk. When i neglected my children i was sadly drunk. When my family asked about my independence i was on my way to get drunk. When i lost countless jobs for being absent, i was drunk. Being a neglected child put much hardship on my soul. Seeing my mother cry because of my father having an affair with her sister made me realize that blood isn't thick at all. The rape i witnessed at 7 years was not easy either. My circumstances seem to burden what should be let go. But it burns in me. No matter what i do. Even the military didn't seem to soothe what discipline i so often needed. Like they say liquor is cheeper than therapy. But im here now. And today may not be the first day in my sobriety, but i hope its the first step. Thank you."

alcoholism,,"Alcoholic Brain and Medication Info Disclaimer: Not a doctor, but wanted to share some of what I have learned about the alcoholic brain and medications that are being used to assist in recovery

The Alcoholic Brain: 
PET scans have shown that alcoholic brains show a decreased metabolic rate compared to non-alcoholics of the same age--depending on length of use and other factors. This just means that the brain has adapted to the chronic presence of alcohol, and *in the absence of this addicted ingredient* the neurons of the brain become somewhat less efficient in terms of metabolism. The good news, is that with prolonged abstinence, the efficiency returns to the same as those of non-alcoholics of the same age. (Picture: https://www.medicalimages.com/imagePreview/01B0W88C?imageId=22449239&amp;imageCode=01B0W88C&amp;contributor=ISM&amp;siteName=www.medicalimages.com&amp;title=&amp;location=&amp;ds=800&amp;newStyle=1&amp;tc=FFFFFF&amp;tbc=333333&amp;qv=95&amp;icc=1&amp;cl=1)

Medical Management: 
Medication is not for everyone and obviously should be discussed with a doctor. But here are some of the options that are currently being used to treat folks like us. 

-Naltrexone 
Naltrexone is a mu-opioid blocker that blocks endorphins. Endorphins are actually thought to play a large role in the process of cravings in the rewards center of the brain (Nucleus Accumbens). Naltrexone can be taken as a once daily oral medication, or as a shot once a month by the name: Vivitrol. Folks who take this medication sometimes report dry mouth, insomnia, or other side effects. 

-Acamprosate 
This medication can help with cravings by a different mechanism; it works to help balance out the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate. During drinking days, GABA used to be increased. According to opponent process theory, ""what goes up must come down"" in a way, so early sobriety often entails an opposite shift of low GABA and high glutamate. 

-Disulfiram 
Most folks probably know this one. It blocks the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a rapid build-up of acetaldehyde in the presence of alcohol. Should one drink while taking it, within 10 minutes a classic and terrible reaction occurs including face flushing, rapid heart rate, and vomiting. The concept is to recondition oneself to associate alcohol with the nasty consequence. However, this medication is falling out of favor because the reaction can be deadly. 

Final thoughts: 
I've heard of whisperings of a patch being developed that combines naltrexone and acamprosate. Idk, just am interested in these things. Hopefully you found it interesting, too. Certainly these do not replace 12-step recovery, exercise, meditation, or anything else that works for you!"

alcoholism,,"Iâ€™m 23 and have been drinking for 5 years Howdy folks, Iâ€™ve been drunk most nights of my adult life. Iâ€™ve let my drinking ruin many good things in my life and Iâ€™ve tried to find help twice before but the environment I was in was more of a â€œgetting help for anything but physical harm is for losersâ€ kind of environment. Iâ€™m afraid of what will come when I stop drinking (if I can actually do it this time) and I was wondering what sort of insight you folks might have for a dude who lives on his own and has no one close by or in the loop about my drinking. Iâ€™ve gone two weeks sober before and that was one of the worst physical experiences Iâ€™ve had. 

Any help or words of encouragement would be much appreciated. I donâ€™t want to drink forever and I know Iâ€™ve got to stop."
alcoholism,,"High functioning alcoholic? I grew up around drinking. Saw the bad sides, and the good sides. I never drank till I turned 21. No drugs or anything. Married at 20 as soon as I graduated boot camp and got to my 1st duty station. Wife was 18. We had already been together for 4 years at that point. This was 2006. Being in the Marine Corps was an experience. Drinking was a part of the culture. Didn't help watching my parents drinking while growing up. So I Drank. Nothing bad ever happened, I was always a happy drunk, and a lot of the time emotional. Went through the occasional funny parts of it like peeing on things. Got that under control. Fast forward 14 years, now have a drink every night for 3 years straight. Sometimes 3 or 4 beers on work nights, 15-20 beers on weekends. I have never missed work due to a hangover because I don't get hangovers. The drinking does not mess with my home life because I'm not a mean drunk. Just my wife is concerned of my health because at 34 I have just recently been diagnosed with gout. I don't need to drink because I've gone weeks without drinking (due to work related injuries and surgery) I've never experienced withdraws. I do have depression and anxiety. and I'm writing this while drunk. Just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar situation."
alcoholism,,"Turmoil I'm almost 24 and have been drinking heavily almost every night for the last four years. I tried quitting two months ago, and then had an awfully long, solo 13-hour shift and ended up drinking for the following three nights after three or four weeks of sobriety. But now it's been a solid month without alcohol and I'm having a really difficult time. I feel like the physical ache to drink is gone, but I'm dealing with a lot of mental and emotional turmoil, lately. I feel psychologically restless and weak. I've lost all control over my emotions, and will periodically cry for no reason at all. I can't control it. In the daytime, I'm usually fine. I can go about my business, no problem. But when the sun goes down and I'm able to think, I just feel despair. I realize I haven't developed any interesting hobbies or past times. I would literally just scroll through my phone and drink a dozen beers (which is excessive anyway, but especially for being a 5-foot nothing female). I've been writing and journaling, reading and getting into spirituality and whatnot. But, god I just feel this sadness deep in my guts. And the sadness is starting to creep into daytime hours. When changing into my uniform at work today, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and starting tearing up, for no reason at all. Thankfully, I was able to stop it then, without full-on crying. I know it will get better with time and I know that a large part of it has to do with seasonal depression issues. I try to remember that alcohol won't solve my problems and how guilty and sick I would feel with myself the next day. I'm just sad, is all."

I tried taking him to the ER earlier today and he threw a tantrum and made a scene in the ER lobby so we left (I also just started working at said hospital as well). Heâ€™s up almost all night, throwing a pity party for himself, on YouTube looking up depressing fkn music, randomly yelling (pretty sure our neighbors hate us). I donâ€™t wanna leave him because I worry something will go terribly wrong if I leave and Iâ€™m not there for him. But Iâ€™m starting to get depressed and I feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind. He says he doesnâ€™t want me to leave and we most definitely love each other very much. When heâ€™s sober, heâ€™s incredibly fun/funny, adventurous and smart. Whatâ€™s worse is that I moved with him to be closer to his family. But Iâ€™m starting to wonder if I lâ€™ve made a mistake. My lease back home is almost done and Iâ€™m pretty sure my landlord will hate me if I ask him to take me back as a resident.

alcoholism,,"My sister is an alcoholic &amp; refuses to get help Back in 2012 my sister was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and multiple personality disorder.

In her doctor records it says sheâ€™s not allowed to be put on narcotics again. After going to therapy for depression she started to improve and go out with the family &amp; her friends. As of right now sheâ€™s 26 years old whoâ€™s jobless and drinks every single day. Thereâ€™s not a single day that goes by where sheâ€™s not drunk.

alcoholism,,"I think for the first time tonight I realized I am capable of pacing myself while drinking. I did well (IMO), and am perfectly coherent and happy after drinking.

alcoholism,,"How does one help someone who wont help themselves My father has been an alcoholic for as long as I have been alive. He says it runs in the family but everyone else has told me that he is the only one. We have tried several times to get him to stop drinking, but he refuses to do it. He acknowledges that he has a problem, he even calls himself a drunk but he doesn't care who he affects or what repercussions his actions have. We aren't allowed to attend most family functions anymore because he makes everyone uncomfortable. Most of the bars he will go to will only be for a few months at a time, because he drinks to the point where they have to cut him off every night. Not only that but he may possibly be the most racist and inconsiderate person I know. He speaks his mind freely and causes problems wherever he goes.

I have been lurking in the shadows for a while, hoping to see a post about a similar situation and anyone who might be able to help. My question to you reddit, how can I help my father get the help he needs when he doesn't want it? I feel bad saying this but after everything he has put me and my family through I'm not even sure I want to help him. I almost want to slowly distance myself from him to avoid the pain. I have said for a long time, the only thing he ever taught me was the reasons why I shouldn't have a family because I never want anyone to have to go through what I have, especially my own family. Either way I know it is a tough situation and I know deep down I do want to help him, but thank you for sitting through my rant and giving me a medium to get this off my chest. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"
alcoholism,,"Second Chance So, this past weekend I met up with a girl I grew up with. Recently moved to her area for work and hit her up to see if she wanted to grab dinner. She then invited me to an event and to join along a Sunday Funday type deal.

Everyone was pretty banged up but of course I got pretty banged up. We were really hitting it off and flirting then I ended up getting kicked out of this bar. Incredibly embarrassing and she was super cool about it. Had to go pick up my car the next day and of course she was walking out to her car as I was picking it up. She had to go to work so it was a brief, but good interaction I thought. I like the girl but I have no idea how to ask her out again after this relapse... and would have to explain that I am a recovering alcoholic.

She is repeatedly being admitted to the hospital, nearly weekly, for throwing up blood and she is rapidly losing weight, unable to hold down a job, and refusing to get a liver transplant/get clean. Iâ€™m an only child and my mother is single, so all of this is falling on me for the most part. And up until now,  Iâ€™ve compartmentalized it and been so angry and resentful that I wasnâ€™t fully feeling it.

alcoholism,,"Been an alcoholic since 17. I've had periods where I've been able to refrain but it's always ended in relapse. I usually don't drink a crazy amount but I average around 8-10 units every 2-3 days. I'm 20 now, how long you reckon I got before I start to have serious repercussions?"
alcoholism,,"Am I an alcoholic? So today at around 9pm when I had 2 crates of beer delivered to my house after already drinking 5 magnums my son called me an alcoholic. Heâ€™s 11. I drink a lot. 
I work in a professional job. I donâ€™t drink days before I work generally but can have a lot of days off sometimes and will drink maybe 1-3 days a week depending on my shifts. He said I couldnâ€™t go a week without drinking. That might be true. I canâ€™t remember a time in the past 10 years that Iâ€™ve gone a week without drinking. Itâ€™s worse when Iâ€™m on holiday and it wouldnâ€™t be abnormal to drink every day when Iâ€™m off. Not always to excess but an average would be around 15 units a night. Iâ€™d be functional the next day after that. I could drink a lot more sometimes. It is also usual to have days off. Sometimes up to 6 consecutive days off drinking. 
I have historically got up and started drinking early in the morning but usually only on party weekends etc when Iâ€™m going a bit mad and everyone else is. I also come from a culture where excessive drinking is pretty much the norm. Everyone does it, everyone talks about it, no one ever says, your drinking is out of control etc. Itâ€™s basically a running joke that weâ€™d all drink vodka through the eye. Weâ€™d have a gin in work at 9am if it were acceptable. 
I often crave a drink, particularly after difficult shifts or hard days. I feel relaxed when I drink but the day after Iâ€™m usually tired, irritable and ineffective. 
Iâ€™ve put on a lot of weight in the past few years, my house is a riot, I feel like my brain doesnâ€™t work like it should and Iâ€™m permanently tired. 
As a teenager I had pretty serious mental health problems and alcohol was always a coping mechanism. It probably has been since I was around 13. Iâ€™m early 30s now. 
My only abstinent phase was when pregnant and breastfeeding and in the first few years of my sons life I probably only drank a few times a year.
I have thought for a while that my drinking is starting to affect my life in negative ways. Specifically I am not as efficient as I used to be, I am not as cognitively efficient either. I am tired all the time and have no energy to do anything. The things I do do, I do in a fugue of sleepiness or hungoverness generally. 
My anxiety has also been pretty terrible in the past year. Itâ€™s difficult to tell whether my job caused the escalation in my anxiety or my drinking and which caused the exacerbation of the other. 
I did see my GP around October last year and was signed off for stress and anxiety. They offered antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication which I declined as I have tried a number before and feel that they have been ineffective. I have tried a number of antidepressants and also found that when I came off beta blockers I was getting horrendous migraines. At that time in October I had symptoms close to PTSD due to an extremely stressful work environment. I couldnâ€™t leave the house, everything made my heart pound. I suppose Iâ€™m a little better now but often things like going to the supermarket are just such a huge and scary task. 
I find it difficult to pick apart everything thatâ€™s going on in my life. I think I probably do have a problem with alcohol, that being a psychological one that goes back  20 years. I donâ€™t know how to start addressing that. 
I have considered AA but have actually attended AA meetings before with friends and personally would describe them as a scary cult. I know that they help so many people and do so much excellent work and fill the gaps in the health service but I just donâ€™t know that AA will ever be for me. I donâ€™t believe in a God, I donâ€™t believe in a higher power, I canâ€™t commit to all that mantra stuff. Maybe I should go via health services for help? I just donâ€™t know. Maybe I donâ€™t really have a problem and Iâ€™m just being melodramatic?
Any insight much appreciated."
alcoholism,,"Worried about my dad Hi,

IÂ´ve been noticing for the last 3-4 years, that my dad drinks too much and IÂ´m really starting to get worried with him.

IÂ´m only 17 years old , and itÂ´s very hard for me to cope with this situation because it happens way too often. He is not the kind of person that drinks every day till he passes out, but it seems like nowadays everything is an excuse to drink , for example , every time we go to a restaurant he has to drink a entire bootle of wine and sometimes even more and this leads to very unconfortable moments , every time he goes out on the weekend with his friends he shows at home wasted.

At least once a week (work days) he shows at home a little tipsy and then he drinks again at dinner.

I think my dad can be considered as a functional alchoolic , he never had any trouble at work (at least that im aware of), but he frequently drives above the legal limit and I have no idea how to talk with him about this situation, I mean it shouldnÂ´t even be my job, but my mum avoids this topic and he is not a very open person, which makes things even harder."
alcoholism,,"Looking for hope for friend Hi all
First post, sorry if this is a mess or doesnâ€™t make sense my 32yr old friend (and ex) has finally submitted to hospital after six years of me trying 


He is an alcoholic (1L vodka a day most likely)
 (I am in long term recovery 5 yrs hi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ ) 
and has been living in another country for the last 8 years (this is why I canâ€™t be there and my only information is from his messages &amp; he tends to try and skew the facts to make it not alcohol related- he is in severe denial) 

I have driven myself insane reading medical journals and I need to know if any of you can take these facts and make sense, I need to know where weâ€™re at as he is not honest and I think I need to book a flight tomorrow (or maybe I am just overreacting like he says...) 

(My assumption is late stage liver cirrhosis and possible failure ) but he is reticent to let me speak this and just tells me the doctors have diagnosed it as â€˜spleen and liver infection not alcohol related at all but the alcohol doesnâ€™t help!â€



The facts 

Huge ascites on stomach - they diagnosed this visibly and then x ray but it hurt him a lot to lay on his back 


He has been vomiting blood and the other end for over a year and excretes puss 
Nose bleeds, shaking, stomach pain and difficult breathing and walking (although he has maintained his desk job throughout this until hospital - but barely) 

Severe Vitamin K deficiency &amp; malnutrition (he has not been able to eat or keep down much food for at least a year but the last time I saw him in person five years ago he barely ate once in seven days) 

Severely swollen liver and spleen
Pushing on his lungs and other organs 

Blood isnâ€™t clotting and his muscles are wasted and his is severely underweight apart from the huge belly 

And the newest news â€œthe doctors have said that my veins have created their own route to bypass my liverâ€ 



He is an unreliable narrator and it hard being emotionally invested as he squeezes the few facts he gives me in between masses of dialogue which I know in my heart is bull - 
He is telling me the doctors say he will need to â€œcut downâ€ bit not damaged enough to have to stop ...? Really?! 

He did not want Valium substitute while in hospital and said he doesnâ€™t need a drink but they have forced this upon him (I am very glad they are doing this so as not to cold turkey him) 

The doctors have now performed blood tests and CT and ultrasound too and hoping to drain the fluid which is way more than they thought 

(He doesnâ€™t like to give me information that backs up a diagnosis of anything alcohol related and just deflects so I hope Iâ€™m not crazy in thinking his litre a day of vodka and these symptoms match up with the probable sad truth) 



Has anyone got experience of a close person or themselves having had these symptoms and possibly what they mean- 
Iâ€™m being gaslit out of all proportion by my in denial &amp; addicted friend whom I dearly love and hope anyone could shed some light on these things and what they might mean for him as I sadly cannot fly out to be there nor does he want anyone to 



Not seeking medical advice obviously, he is in a safe place and with good doctors, I just need to know to be honest if this situation has any hope (from any experience) I just need help with trusting these facts and navigating the bull- so I know if I need to fly out ASAP"
alcoholism,,"Night terrors from drinking? Also a question on Naltrexone Okay, I don't think i've posted here before. You know how it goes. 

For the past few years, on an infrequent basis, i've been having insane night terrors, that seems to be the only thing it could be. People around me hear me banging on things, screaming, etc, while asleep. I'm completely unaware of it and not in control of it at all. 

I drink a LOT. Probably close to a liter of liquor per evening on a long night. 

I had severe sleeping issues prior to starting to drink, which is why I started in the first place, but I never did anything crazy in my sleep, which kind of leaves the booze as the primary suspect here. 

Anyone else ever experience anything like this? 

Also, I just got my first order of Naltrexone from a sketchy Indian pharmacy, which i'm excited about, but also a bit nervous. If I don't drink, or drink significantly less than normal, I have crazy muscle spasms, insane dreams, fairly typical withdrawl/DT type symptoms. 

If the Naltrexone works and gets me drinking way less, am I in danger of major seizures? I've got a limited amount of anti-spasm medication, which works on the days when I have the issues, but not enough for if it were to start being an everyday thing, and no easy route to get more. 

I really want to start fighting this, I just don't want to accidentally put myself in even more danger."

About two years ago my mom's dad, my grandpa, died of cancer. It was a hard loss for the entire family, completely devastating. My grandparents were married 52 years and everyone very much still depended on him. I was happy he got to meet my child but unfortunately my child was too young to remember him. Then about a year later my dad died of alcoholism. He abandoned our family when my parents got divorced and found someone new. His new girlfriend drank with him and they were drinking constantly. Everyone warned me about how rough he looked and everyone tried to warn him about his alcoholism. It didn't work he met his death just 8 months after getting remarried. My dad was an amazing man when I was growing up. He coached my softball team year round for years, he was so smart and funny. He listened to me and encouraged me. I have a hard relationship with my mom so he was always my go to. His loss was also very hard for myself and my siblings. Not to mention his entire family as well. 
Lately I have been drinking. I don't know if it is a way to cope. I feel like I'm in denial about these losses still. Rather than feel miserable about it all I just push everything down. Lately I have been hiding how much I've actually been drinking from my family. I know I need to stop. I know I need to make a change. It just feels so hard. I don't even know why I compulsively buy alcohol and drink it, it's almost like I'm in autopilot mode. Drinking doesn't make me feel better, I feel crummy. I'm always tired and sometimes hungover. I'm angry and anxious a lot of the time, I'm unsure what to do. I'm unsure how to make myself quit. Everything right now feels like a blur and despite being happily married with a great little family I feel alone and empty inside.

alcoholism,,"ADHD medication â€œcuredâ€ my alcoholism? This is in a way a success story but not one born out of my own willpower. For nearly the past 2 years I struggled a lot with drinking. As a girl with not much weight I was drinking 0,35-0,6 liters of vodka a night mixed with cola and other things. 

Well, last month I finally got a long overdue diagnosis for ADHD and got a prescription for Methylphenidate. I lied about my alcohol use because it would have probably denied a medication based treatment (or so was my assumption)

Well itâ€™s 1 month later and with the exception of 3 ciders spread over the month I pretty much lost the need to drink. I walk past the liquor section and the rising urge is as easily crushed as it comes up.

I assume the withdrawals were asked because I replaced it with a different chemical sensation? I just wanted to share this with people who might understand. 


I canâ€™t offer any wise words because I feel like I cheated my way to this... but I want to say to everyone here that I believe in you with all my heart and wish you all the best. For your loved ones, your health and your mental wellbeing.

alcoholism,,"Husbands (recovering) employee showed up dead drunk at work. I'll keep it short: My husband is sober since a couple of months and is slowly opening up. He does take his sobriety surprisingly well.

My Husband didn't send him home right away, only after he witnessed him slurring at a customer some time later. After consulting HR they chewed him out for not telling the employee a reason and not firing him immediately.

alcoholism,,"My exes drunk words hurt...am I the problem? Iâ€™ve been in my head the past 72 hours just thinking about the encounter I had with my toxic-on-again-off-again-ex boyfriend since 2016 (weâ€™re 25F &amp; 25M). We ended up seeing each other while walking to the same bar... it didnâ€™t end nicely. We argued on the way there, he talked poorly about me to his friends that were there (who are also all my friends) as the night went on. Eventually I had enough and I left with a few of mine, and he follows us out. Walking directly behind us. He texts me off an app, and I immediately call an Uber home. He calls me in my Uber, berating me about how Iâ€™m an alcoholic - and he doesnâ€™t care I got in a car accident a few days prior, as he said â€œI donâ€™t give two f*cksâ€ - Iâ€™m a b*tch, Iâ€™m a loser who is only friends with weirdos and nerds, Iâ€™m insane, that he can make all of the people there not want to be friends with me if he tells them all the shit thatâ€™s happened with our breakups... and goes on and on and on telling me all of these things while heâ€™s drunk - when not a week and a half ago we were together and things were fine. 

Since then, I have cut contact with him as the encounter really effected my mental health. I did wreck my car mid last week because I fell asleep at the wheel. (No legal trouble to report currently.) I understand where I went wrong here, and I admit my faults. However the words that he said that say have stuck with me. What if I really am the problem? I donâ€™t drink daily though? I donâ€™t  drink from day in to day out when I do though? IIâ€™ll have a beer or two in social settings, maybe a shot if itâ€™s a Friday or Saturday, but I donâ€™t blackout every time I drink. I have my moments sure but who doesnâ€™t? 

Thinking about this has actually gotten me kind of down. I had even asked my close friends their thoughts on the matter. All except one said weâ€™ve all at some point have worried about your drinking, but we know youâ€™re not an alcoholic, you just need to work on moderation when you do go out. Then there was one friend who told me she does not think I have a healthy relationship, and I may never with alcohol. She said I had made her uncomfortable too whenever she came in town and I was trying to get her to drink, and enticing others to encourage her to drink, whenever she was insistent on staying sober. I appreciated her honesty, apologized, and thanked her for being so blunt. However I have been sitting here wondering still.... am I really the problem? Was my drunk toxic ex just spouting cruel things to throw at me because he was angry I was there? 

Itâ€™s one thing to not acknowledge or make excuses for my actions. I know where I went wrong, and Iâ€™m from here on out actively working on moderation and being more responsible with drinking. However, His words cut deep, so deep that when we were on the phone that night I really lost all sense of myself and my place here - I didnt want to be here."
alcoholism,,My Mom Is it bad that I can only sanely talk with my mom if I'm drunk? If I'm not drunk I always get irritated and short with her and am just always in a hurry begging for the convo to be over. But when I'm drunk it's no problem..... I know I'm an alcoholic. But.........
alcoholism,,"New Alcohol Belief System - Feeling Trapped I stopped drinking alcohol in April of last year. So Iâ€™m not an entire year yet but getting close.

Iâ€™ve started to think that I might reintroduce alcohol to my life but Iâ€™ve been struggling with establishing what my new values or belief system with alcohol is.

Brief background: 
I was drinking alcohol once a night. A can or two of beer. Maybe a glass of bourbon. It was every night.

I had convinced myself that I liked the taste and I drank it instead of pop. I had been into logging new craft beers on untappd and then start trading and selling bourbon. It became a full blown hobby.

Those around me and the culture led me to believe that everything about this was ok.

My problem was that but then also on occasion if I had drank to much and conflict was introduced - I would tend to get angry and would not be able to control the anger.

So I stopped cold - I tried to drink some on an anniversary trip soon after that ... but that was a bad decision. So Iâ€™ve been sober since.

However I do love beer and bourbon and that had become a part of me. The breweries, the bourbon trails, the tastings... it was fun and I want to say I could do that again someday.

Today:
Iâ€™m trying to define rules with alcohol and reasons when itâ€™s ok and when too much is too much.

Weâ€™ve also been looking at was to better manage our budget so not buying alcohol has significantly helped with that.

Iâ€™m struggling because over the course of the year Iâ€™ve developed a ton of new beliefs..

1. There is no real reason to drink alcohol. Ever.
2. There is no real reason to spend money on material and luxury things. Like alcohol. Ever.
3. Everyone who does these things around me makes me judge them like I was once judged.
4. I shouldnâ€™t spend money on myself unless I absolutely need something

As you can see I feel like Iâ€™m on a slippery slope to not having any luxuries in my life at all - because I am guilting myself out of having anything because there may not be a real reason to obtain these things. Ever.

As a Catholic I am starting to believe that I am actually on the better course, too. However culture suggests that I am not living or enjoying life. My wife suggests I am judging her now and that what she is doing is not wrong in her eyes but drinking wine to â€œrelaxâ€ would be the wrong reason to drink alcohol per my new beliefs. Mind you she only drinks once every month or two... but I still wonder why she does at all. When I ask her about my new found beliefs she feels attacked by me... 

Should I just ignore the culture around me and continue to feel trapped in my own judgement?

Thoughts on this? Advice?"
alcoholism,,"don't need alcohol to function, but need it to socialize I refuse to drink alone and let myself get to that point, like i often think about it but something in my brain just tells me its wrong. when i'm hanging out with guys i *need* alcohol to be even vaguely funny and not socially awkward. it works for the first 3 or 4 shots but then i cant get myself to stop and end up drinking half a handle and embarrassing myself but i don't drink constantly. maybe like once a week. if i really feel like i need a drink, since i refuse to drink alone ill hang out with random guys for the sole reason of getting drunk and not feeling lonely. for some reason this fucked up logic makes sense to me, like somehow its better than drinking alone because i'm actually with someone and doing things. Like ill enjoy their company but the deciding factor to if i actually want to go out is if i'm able to get drunk or not. Then there's my friends, i love hanging out with them sober but a lot of the time there's this thought that's like ""if i was drunk right now id be having so much more fun"" everything just feels so mundane and boring without alcohol and i'm not sure what to do."
alcoholism,,"2 years sober today. If I can do it, you can do it. 2 years ago today, I was in the pit of utter demoralization. I found myself in the ER after a particularly bad day, and my SO was threatening to throw me out because of my foolishness. Drinking was ruining my life. 

Since then, Iâ€™ve repaired relationships, rebuilt my career, and regained my physical health. A decade or more of bad behavior has been virtually reversed since I decided to get my shit together with the help of the folks in a certain fellowship. Iâ€™m grateful for 2 years, and Iâ€™m grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way."

alcoholism,,"Trying to taper vs cold turkey. Last night I tried to start tapering after realizing I was having withdrawal symptoms during the work day after drinking 10-12 stronger beers (in the 7-10% range) almost every night for the last 2 years. 

I ended up drinking more than I usually do. 

Today I am once again having withdrawals. And my anxiety is causing a panic attack. Iâ€™m sweating and feel nauseous and I canâ€™t focus at work. 

I am considering trying to go cold turkey this weekend.  But Iâ€™m afraid. 

I guess I just needed to get this out of my head and onto paper."
alcoholism,,"Weird thing with alcohol I'm a 30yo male. I never imbibed alcohol after a nasty event in my early 20's that just so happened to take place when I was drunk for the first time.

My life overall hasn't gone great. I'm lucky in some ways but not others. Bojack Horseman is a close enough parallel to my life of all things that if my life was made into a TV show critics would call it a copy.

I just want to get my strange experience with alcohol out there and see if any one else shares this mindset.

Last year on a whim I started drinking spirits. There's a spirit I like that when mixed with a fruit mix is barely tolerable as otherwise I completely hate the taste. When I have this drink(s) it's equivalent to 6 units of alcohol. I started having this in November 2019 once every 3 nights. In December it became once ever 2 nights. Towards Xmas and new years it was every night. I was getting real depressed because I worried about being addicted. I didn't even like the effect. I don't know why I did it. I'd imagine my evening ahead of me and I'd always put that drink in my plans. The thought of having it was better than having it.

So mid-January rolls round and all the celebrations are over. I just stopped putting drink into my evening plans. I find I'm okay that night. Huh? Night two comes around and I'm still fine. Day 3? Fine again. Day 4? Well I'm still fine so I guess I wasn't addicted after all. In that case let's have the drink again!

That's been my pattern ever since mid Jan. There's no urge to drink. No urge to buy any. I've had none now for days. I wrote this post because I thought I might get some more tonight? But then I realize that hey there's no point because it just makes me sway a bit and feel tired. If I wanted to feel tired I could just have a Phenergan! If I wanted to sway and feel woozy I could just have a Phenergan and \*fight it\*.

I genuinely don't understand any of this. After months of alcohol ... even just a bit ... I'm supposed to be hooked? At least mildly but theres no physical or mental symptoms.

But then I wonder is that thought where I go ""lets include alcohol in my evening plans"" the addiction for me? Because it sometimes appears. It always feels good to think that, but the reality is that it does little for me. In-case you're wondering evening plans are things like watching a TV show or film with friends or family, going for evening constitutionals around the city or beach, going to an art class. I'm never alone when I drink. I did a few times earlier having my drink with lunch on lazy lazy days.

Take care everyone."

alcoholism,,"[NY] How can my family help my cousin who is dealing with alcoholism? Hello,

My family is going through a very rough situation right now. I have a cousin, let's call him Rick, who is al alcoholic. He had managed to get sober for the last two years, but after his last relationship ended about two months ago, he started heavily drinking again. The situation is worse that it has ever been before, to the point where he isn't going to work or paying any of his bills, or his rent. My aunt, his mother, lives in the same building as him, and she along with my other cousin, Sergio (Rick's brother), have been the ones that have been helping Rick the most. It has gotten to the point where Rick has gone to my aunt's apartment and started taking money from her, and even shoved her at one point so he could get her purse. 

We want to know what we can do to get Rick help. An order of protection has been discussed by us, but my aunt is unwilling to go through that process because she wants to be able to help her son. Are there any city/state resources or legal resources we can use in this situation?

Thanks for any help and advice.

alcoholism,,"Hi, Iâ€™m new to this sub... Iâ€™m a 44 year old female. I havenâ€™t drank any alcohol in about a year and a half. I finally admitted to myself that I just canâ€™t handle it. If I start drinking, that part of my brain that tells me to quit just becomes nonexistent. I will drink till I pass out.
Iâ€™ve lied to myself over and over that I could be responsible till finally I realized that I just couldnâ€™t even let myself have that first drink. It will always lead to too many embarrassing moments - moments I wonâ€™t even be able to remember.
My problem now is, I replaced my drinking with anything that might take the edge off the cravings- except for illegal drugs. But Kratom, yes (itâ€™s legal in my state) and an overuse of Kava tinctures. - To the point that it just feels absolutely stupid and spending way too much.

alcoholism,,"Iâ€™ve drank almost every night for the past 3 years Iâ€™m a 25 year old male. I turned to booze towards the end of college as my sleep issues worsened. It helped enough that it made me fall asleep once I finally felt tired, but also pushed me to stay up later and later since I felt so good at that point in the night. 

This cycle continued after I graduated almost 3 years ago. Itâ€™s become a part of my life. 3 hours before bed itâ€™s time to crack open the vodka and enjoy my night. By the time I get to bed I can finally pass out. If I donâ€™t drink Iâ€™m awake all night with fragmented sleep. 

As time passed however, the drinking became less affective at helping me sleep. In addition, Iâ€™ve gained about 90 pounds in the past 3 years as a result of drinking.

Fast forward to today, I developed a weird feeling in my chest. I work EMS, so at first I figured i pulled a muscle lifting a patient. But it didnâ€™t feel muscular. I decided to go to an urgent care to ease my mind. A half hour later Iâ€™m in the ER because the EKG came back normal. Long story short, I was released 8 hours later and told to follow up with a cardiologist. My heart rate is higher than it should be which could be for a myriad of reasons. 

Iâ€™ve taken this as a wake up call. Iâ€™ve beat the crap out of my body these past 3 years with booze. Iâ€™m now terrified of the health consequences Iâ€™ve subjected myself to, and can only hope that whatever damage has been done can be reversed with a healthier lifestyle. 

I know that quitting this habit is going to be hard. While Iâ€™ve never felt that I couldnâ€™t survive a night without booze, itâ€™s certainly been hell on the rare nights that Iâ€™ve had to abstain from it over the years I started tonight, and Iâ€™m already feeling incredibly down and having some cravings even though I should be happy that Iâ€™m taking control of my health."

My alcoholic husband and I are separated and headed for divorce.  I keep trying to figure out how we got here, because I just donâ€™t understand his behavior.  I guess maybe thereâ€™s no explanation for the way an alcoholic acts, but I thought I would ask and see if I could get some closure.  For the last five or so years of our marriage, when he would get drunk, he would get angrier and angrier at me. He would scream at me and curse at me and make fun of me and threaten to hurt me. Towards the end, he would threaten to kill me when he got drunk and we got separated when he actually pushed me down one time.  There was no particular reason, I never did anything to make him angry. When he was sober, he never acted like that, and he would say how much he loved me.  Now that we are separated, he talks about how much he loves me and wants to get back together, but I will never do that, because I honestly think he is one drinking binge away from actually killing me. But I just donâ€™t understand how someone can act so differently when heâ€™s drunk and when heâ€™s sober. What does he actually think, does he love me or does he hate me? Why would he say all those horrible things when he was drunk if he didnâ€™t mean them?  Thanks for any insights."
alcoholism,,"Just wanting to introduce myself and maybe meet people with similar experiences. Hi! This is gonna be long so I apologise.

I am 25 years old and I am concerned that I may be or might become an alcoholic.

My dad died 3 months ago, 3 days after my 25th birthday. He is my bio dad who has always been in my life but I have only seen a few times a year but had a close relationship with... Iâ€™ve always said â€œheâ€™s not my father heâ€™s my best friend.â€ I have a brilliant step dad who has been my dad since I was 3yo. I got a call on my birthday when I was in South Korea and I was told that my dad would probably die that night, they had given him 9 months last January so I was prepared. I was due to fly home 3 days later on a trip that had been planned for months. They managed to get him on the phone and we told each other â€œI love youâ€. He managed to hold on until I flew home, travelled a few hours to get to him, held his hand and he died that night like he was waiting for me.

My dad died from stomach cancer due to alcoholism and smoking. 

On top of that, my 15 year old cat who has slept by my side since she was 8 weeks old... I just had to put her to sleep.... so you can all imagine this has all been even harder for me on the drinking front.

I have been drinking heavily for a few years now, I only allow myself 3 nights a week but I will drink almost 70cl of spirit a night. I find it very difficult if I drink a glass but cant drink more in one night. Iâ€™m totally fine not drinking at all but when I drink I canâ€™t stop. For 2 years Iâ€™ve been hiding alcohol from my parents so I can sneak into my room and drink it. I donâ€™t have to drink to function, I never let myself drink 2 nights in a row (unless its a special event or christmas) and i never day drink or drink before 7pm. But when I drink I have to get very drunk, which means I will drink a dangerous amount in one night, 3 times a week. The worst part about all of this is that I live in the countryside and have only one friend here. So 2/3 nights that I drink that much... Iâ€™m drinking alone.

Now. I donâ€™t want to stop drinking because it is fun. But I really need to find a way to control how much I drink when I drink alone.

I have aspergers with serious insomnia, I am 25 and right now I canâ€™t achieve my dream because I got a D in GSCE physics (I wanna be second officer on a cruise ship). I live with my parents and I get government benefits. It is SO hard not to drink so much when Iâ€™m all alone every night and Iâ€™m so seriously depressed about how my life is going. I do not want to cut drinking out of my life but I do want to stop HAVING to binge when I drink.

alcoholism,,"My mom was an alcoholic :(  This  is my mom. She died when I was six from alcoholism. I get asked a lot  what itâ€™s like losing a parent at such a young age and here it is:  
 

 A whole part of you is shattered! My mom wasnâ€™t involved in my life.  Her addiction to alcohol was more important than loving her child.  Looking at her in her casket made me very numb and confused. I didnâ€™t  cry at all. At six years old, you really donâ€™t understand  death. I felt like more of a stranger than her daughter because of the  love I wanted from her but she didnâ€™t give me back. For a long time, I  kept asking myself if it was my fault. I knew it wasnâ€™t my fault at all.  But the question was always there.   
 

I wished I would have had  that Mom role model in my life. I used to get jealous watching other  kids from school going up and hugging their mom. It would kill my soul  every day.   
 

Now Iâ€™m a mother, and boy am I making up for the  hugs that I missed all those years. But as for losing my mom at the age  of six, I felt like I carried broken glass within my heart for years.  After starting therapy four years ago, Iâ€™m starting to heal and move on  with my life. I have forgiven her but I havenâ€™t been able to love her  still. Will I ever, I donâ€™t know. Losing a parent to addiction when you  are a young child, should be nothing to experience...ever. There is help  and there is hope. Your children need you! They suffer along with the  parent whoâ€™s an addict. Yes, children do suffer too.

So in college for my senior year my bf pointed out I had a problem because I would drink every weekend and sometimes weekdays. But at what point is it just a college experience from an alcoholic problem. Did it become a problem when I started drinking whenever I started feeling sad about family? Or is it the quantity that I'm drinking? Now I don't drink too much but sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night because of a family related nightmare, then go to the kitchen and get a shot. When I don't drink I'll cry for hours and eventually fall asleep and wake up with a headache and feel like crap. But when I drink everything just feels numb that I won't cry and fall asleep within an hour or two and feel less like crap. I know it's supposed to give less sleep quality but I feel like it's better than the alternative.
Now I'm just thinking when does it become an actual problem. Like is this drinking ok or am I supposed to try to stop.

When I spoke with the coroner and he was talking about how there was no indication that drugs or alcohol caused his death, I literally broke down crying. My dad, suffered from the lifelong disease of alcoholism and died a sober man. I canâ€™t even articulate what that means to me as his daughter. To anyone reading this that struggles with alcoholism, addiction or mental illness, Iâ€™m rooting for you...every minute, every hour, every day you are sober, and I am so proud of you."

alcoholism,,"What do you look forward to each day? One of the scariest(?) things that I encounter each time I try to stop is that there is nothing to look forward to. I absolutely loath the notion of having a 'quiet night'. Without drink, what is there to look forward to? A meal? Reading a book before bed?

What makes me so *frustrated* is that there are so many things to look forward to. A cosy bed, a good book. Not waking up feeling like shit. No anxiety. The biggest (no pun intended) side effect of my alcoholism is massive weight gain. Why can't I replace drinking 10 beers a night with going for a run? I have a bench press, exercise bike and rowing machine in my flat. All gone unused for 2 years.

I gave up smoking 2 years ago. I can give up an addiction. I have absolutely no desire to smoke. It smells awful. Why can't I give up drinking when all of my associated thoughts are negative?"

Every time I drank it was my choice and everyone around me was saying they lost the power of choice and they couldnâ€™t put it down no matter how hard they tried. So I canâ€™t relate to that and donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m an alcoholic. I now have 36 days sober after a recent relapse and just donâ€™t know.

The moment liquor hits my lips, I'm blacking out. I remember what happens in the moment. But the following day everything is a blur.

I do not want to do this. I feel like I am not in control. When I wake in the morning I can feel my liver is inflamed. Everything is telling me to stop. But I don't.

alcoholism,,"Turning to Reddit in search of honest answers. Hello, all, and thank you for taking the time to read this post. Basically, I know the answer can only come from me, probably, but it can't hurt to get the opinions from others. 

I don't know if I technically have a problem with alcohol or not. Thus, I do not know if meetings would be necessary or if I'd be welcome. Allow me to explain. 

From 21-24 I spent the weeks binge drinking. Probably 2-3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. I enjoy it a lot. I don't care for the after effects. 

From 25 until now, the amount of times I get drunk is less but I can't recall the last time I went a week without anything. I mostly drink at least a tall can with dinner 2-3 times a week. Lately, though, (past month) I've not been doing that, but instead drinking 6-10 standard drinks on the weekend.

I have compulsive behavior. I know this. I guess I am seeking advice. I care about my family and I want to be healthy. I just enjoy alcohol a little too much sometimes. Do I have reason to be concerned? I know 6-10 isn't a lot on a Saturday or Sunday now, but I'm a very thin man and it takes a tall can to feel it. I want to be sober for a long time. Part of me doesn't. I just want to be able to drink moderately. As in, once or twice a month. A drink or two. Even a drink or two a year. That seems unrealistic for me. 

My dad and and his dad are also alcoholics. And from what I've heard this runs in families. 

Am I just overreacting lol

TL;DR: My drinking habits vary, can drink heavy amounts occasionally, rarely go more than a week without at least a standard drink or two. Is there reason for concern?"

I felt betrayed, lied to by others, and was made to feel like a crazy person when I asked if there was a problem. This drinking happened all throughout my childhood and when I asked for help I was told it was natural to have fights with parents, etc.

Its been 8 months since I left and I had filed for divorce almost a month ago. After one scathing round of text messages, it had been radio silence. I was moving on with my life with my new love and things were/are going well

This morning I received terribly sad news: His best friends became worried when they hadnt heard from him and he missed a couple planned gatherings this last week. They couldnt reach him by phone or text so they drove out to his place. His car was in its space, the blinds were drawn. They knocked but the only sound from the inside was of his dogs. Police were called and after some convincing, they agreed to do a welfare check. He was found in bed and had been dead for a couple of days. 

I dont know cause of death yet, but the speculations are either suicide or stroke. He was 53 years old. My only hope is that he is finally at peace."

I usually have 2-3 drinks a night, at home, on the weekends and 1-2 drinks maybe 2-3 nights during the week, but its usually early, around dinner and I never go to bed feeling drunk or anything. I donâ€™t drink so much for the feeling of being drunk (Iâ€™d have to drink more if I wanted that), I just like that little bit of relaxation you get after about a drink or two. 

My usual drink is 1.5-2oz of vodka topped off with 7up or a rum and coke. I donâ€™t drink straight liquor, but I do enjoy a glass of wine as well.

It ruined my relationship and after she broke it off (completely understandable) I went through 2 months of being black out drunk 4+ times a week sneaking alcohol into the house so my friends / family didn't know how much I was drinking. Then one day I woke up and realised I'm not the person I went to be when I'm drink. I'm toxic and hurt the people I care about. It saddens me that I had to lose someone so important to me out of my life for me to realise this but with every day passing it gets easier not to use alcohol to solve my emotions. I'm so proud of myself for fixing this in me and I never want to drink again. Ive started being able to be around drinking and be fine with a soft drink.

alcoholism,,"Slowly realising I may have a problem Short backstory (possible TW): I (20F) have struggled with depression, anxiety, self harm and eating disorders since I was 14. A couple weeks before Christmas I met up with a guy u had been talking to online for a little while. During that night, he raped me while I was asleep.

Ever since that night, Iâ€™ve taken to alcohol to numb the pain. I can probably count on one hand the number of days Iâ€™ve avoided alcohol since then. 


For the past month some of my friends has expressed their concerns about my drinking. But Iâ€™ve always brushed it aside, saying I got it under control and that itâ€™s not a big deal and all that. Because, you know, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m convincing myself of. 

But here I am, visiting my mom during winter break from school (Iâ€™m a part time high school student), and for the second night in a row Iâ€™m quite wasted. And Iâ€™m slowly realising that maybe my friends are right, maybe I do have a problem. But I just donâ€™t see the point of stopping, you know? Because as long as I drink, I can ignore all the pain. As long as I drink, I can feel some kind of happiness, it may be a fake kind of happiness, but at least itâ€™s some form of it. 

And for the first time in my life, Iâ€™m actually scared of what I may end up doing to myself. I canâ€™t stop all these destructive patterns. And alcohol is my only escape.

alcoholism,,"Husband hates me when I'm sober I'm a happy drunk, red wine has been my medication every day for the past 7 years. 

When I'm sober, I'm incredibly irritable, angry, and want nothing more than to be alone and depressed. The longest I've been sober was two months (last September-October) and every day was torture. 

My husband is easily able to go sober, but I have a hard time. We're trying to get pregnant so I need to stop drinking. Whenever I stop drinking, I'm not the happy, bubbly girl my husband expects. I isolate myself, and he starts saying thing like ""I should've married an extrovert"" and ""other women don't act like this."" His words spiral me into drinking again, sometimes in secret. There are times where I've snapped at him (and I apologize) but he'll tell me things like ""If you snap at me again I'm leaving. Just go drink so you chill out."" 

This has been the hardest part of quitting for me. I'm on anti-anxiety meds to help with this while I try to go sober, but they only work some days. I've told my husband that when I go sober I'll need alone time and I'm not going to be happy 24/7. He disappointingly says he knows that, but then will talk and talk and expect me to listen to everything when I just want to explode. Then I get the ""Are you even listening? Guess you don't want me around right now..."" which again makes me feel 100% worse. 

Any advice on how to handle this would be appreciated :( I can't stop the shakes, crying, anxiety and irritability when I'm sober. It's too much.

alcoholism,,"Can't get over drinking  They say ""old habits die hard"" and I guess that's true!

Hi there! I am 27 y.o. male struggling to give up smoking and drinking and generally destructing myself. I need someone to tell me that this is doable because I am tired of trying and failing.

I can't make a shortcut of my situation so you'll have to stick with me here. I've been smoking and drinking for almost 8 years straight no attempts to give up at all. I never gave it any thought, never thought why I am doing this to myself. I guess I was just young and stupid. I had quite a rough childhood...well it was good, not complaining here, but I had a few traumatic incidents and problems with parent support - grown up without father (died when I was 12, seen him a couple of times before he passed away) and my mother never cared about my teen issues. So I grew up learning to deal with my problems on my own, friends were never there to truly understand and not just ""listen"". Fifteen years old me was having quintessential issues - all I thought about at the time was what's my purpose of living and why on Earth I was born in such a shitty place to live (living in a shithole in some CIS country btw).

I guess all that stuff eventually determined my behavior in some way. I started having this tendency of self-destruction. As years passed I kept on smoking and drinking. Been in a deep depression couple of times, but made it through eventually. Traveled around the world for some time and after coming back home I began working as an ESL teacher (had to make a living somehow) then I found that I am doing pretty well at teaching and it became my profession. My job was incompatible with smoking so I quit. I still don't really understand how I gave it up so easily. I quitted cold turkey, but the other self-destructive habits remained. For some time I was really happy with myself - life took a new turn and it seemed to be brighter than it ever was. But all good things must come to an end, right!?

After three years of not smoking I started all over. Came back from 0 to 15 cigarettes a day. It was awful, I hated every single cigarette I smoked, but this time I couldn't quit. So last half a year I was trying to give up smoking because it affects my mind. I can't think clearly when I smoke, my decision making became worse and critical thinking in general has blunted. I've been failing to quit over and over again. Every time I returned to smoking I analyzed what I did wrong to start it again and couldn't see the reason behind it. Then I've made some research into why I am doing what I am doing and found out that this self-destructive behavior comes from my adolescence - I tend to smoke and drink whenever I feel bad or stressed and I perceive it as a support of some kind, which makes sense since nobody ever was there to support me when I needed it.

Now I work on myself. I've put a lot of effort to quit smoking. I go to the gym and work my ass off, also I work on my mindset and always try to keep myself in a good state, but however long I hold on to good things in my life there's always a moment when I break - something happens and I start feeling this urge to smoke or drink. It feels like some part of me just can't stand me being a ""good guy"". So I am wondering is it even possible to overcome this dark part of my nature that always wants me to destroy myself and hate life?! I look at it as a battle and I always lose it. Neither cigarettes nor alcohol give no pleasure or consolation any more, but still can't get rid of that shit.

TL;DR - struggling to overcome bad habits, fail to keep self-improvement consistent.

Any advice/help/words of consolation will be greatly appreciated."

alcoholism,,"I relapsed last night... Hello Reddit, I'm George from Turkey (not my real name). I felt like writing my thoughts down so I decided to do it here.   

&amp;nbsp;

I don't see myself as an alcoholic, rather a fellow who likes drinking more than people around me. I'm in my early 20s and studying computer science in a fairly prestigious school. I didn't start consuming alcohol before my last year of high school. Well, I did drink beer before but I stopped quite soon and never had 2 drinks in a day. Most of my friends had started consuming alcohol at that point, I started drinking late relative to my friend circles. I guess that's because of my religious parents who don't drink or smoke. According to them they never did so.

&amp;nbsp;

I relapsed last night with my friends from school, after a break of 27 days. This was a big deal for me since I had never truly stopped drinking since I started drinking in high school, which was 4 years ago. I think it is fair to say I did not have a week without alcohol in these 4 years. I always fancied a drink, I don't really recall any point where I thought it was a bad idea to drink. I had some problems because of my drinking attitude, I guess some of them were a big deal, but I think I always found a way to find a place for alcohol in my life. I like to blame my parents for this, I always thoughts drugs (including alcohol) in a way that demonizing them past the point they deserve. I realize blaming my parents will not get me anywhere though.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like this break taught me a lot of things, gained me a lot of perspectives, I learned how to see circumstances under a sober view. I also improved my self-trust, I know for a fact I can control alcohol now. I think this break had a lot of positive impacts on me, I might just take some breaks from time to time. I'm going to try being sober on weekdays and stick to drinking in Fridays and Saturdays.

I think I'm going to stop here, I might add some stuff later. Be safe fellas."

He amended that to ""I won't write myself off but I can have a few""

I went to bed early because I have a really important day at uni ahead, and I need to get enough sleep.

He burst into my room at 1:30am, threw a full beer on the floor which I then had to clean up, then flopped onto my bed with his shoes on.

He was sprawled out in such a way that I couldn't fit on either side of him. He's a big man and I couldn't move him and he wouldn't wake up. I had all the lights in my room on and my roommates standing in the doorway scratching their heads. It took us an hour to move him.

I just woke up and he's pissed the bed - again.

alcoholism,,"Any tapering help/suggestions would be welcome. Hi all, I'm a 25yo guy looking for any and all advice on tapering. My alcohol consumption has been steadily increasing this past year. 2 months ago, I moved to a new city and it increased rather steeply. I would say before I came to the conclusion that I needed to quit, I was at anywhere from 7-13 drinks a day. The majority of them would be within a 2-3 hour period after I got home from work and before going to bed. 

I've currently got my timeline laid out, and I've been reading up on how to safely taper, but I want to know if anyone has any tips or tricks for dealing with symptoms. I've been having to deal with shakes,  night sweats and trouble falling asleep, as well as some nausea. Is there anything that can help me sleep more soundly, like taking melatonin? Will anti acid tablets help with nausea at all? I know theres no real way to decrease the shakes besides just slowly going through the taper.

I'm planning on using exclusively beer to taper, and am planning on starting at 9 over the course of the day today, and then decreasing by 1 every day for the next week (A lot of cites say you can decrease it by 2 per day safely, but Web MD has got me all sorts of paranoid). Any and all advice is appreciated, I'm gunna head out and buy a bunch of smart water to replenish electrolytes as well as a bunch of veggies to make sure my body is getting nutrients during this coming week."

so i had a pretty bad addiction and problem with alcohol through ages 14-17. you may think no way, thats super young. but yeah, happens to the best of us. i used it to escape, and partied with shitty people, fucked up a lot of relationships and friendships along the years. heres where i am now, i have held the same job for a year, have my OWN apartment, paying real bills and haven't drank since September 2018. i'm proud of myself. i turned my life around for the best, and i don't associate with the people i drank with. 0 of them. my current boyfriend has helped me with this, being someone that actually supports and cares about me. we got together the month before i stopped drinking. anyways, his 21st birthday is coming up.. i want to drink a couple of beers. maybe some wine, just to relax. now i know my limits. i never want to go back to who i used to be. i know how easy it is to get addicted to something again, but i just want to have a good time for his 21st (st. patricks day btw) what are your opinions on this?

I know if I stopped drinking my health would be much better and I would have more money in my pocket. I try focusing on other things and keeping myself preoccupied but it doesn't really work.

Just wondering what you guys do to resist the urge and how some of you have beat your addiction.

alcoholism,,"First time on here didnt know where to go Hi, this is my first time on reddit I dont know really what in doing so bare with me please.

I am engaged to an alcoholic. I dont know what to do anymore. He isnt abusive or anything just cant stop drinking. He drinks every night, to a point where he spends all of our money on beer. Even when we have no money he asks his friend to buy him beer. 
He doesnt have a job, he keeps quitting them. He doesnt do anything with his life. He keeps making false promises. 

Even when he has a job he still drinks every single day he's off. I just miss him and how nice and normal he is when hes sober. He cant go more than 1 week without drinking and it's making me rethink this whole relationship. When he drinks, I go into a different room until it's time to go to bed. 
I dont want to leave but honestly I'm at a point where I feel like I cant handle it anymore. The only thing holding me back is that he is amazing when he is sober, hes productive, holds a job and is a great person. But I dont think he will ever have a healthy relationship with alcohol (can you even have one? I'm not sure)

alcoholism,,"Have any of you gone to rehab? How did you afford it? I'm getting so discouraged. I've been trying and working on stopping for like 18 months now. But I keep failing. And I'm so tired. 

I mostly do ok, make it 3, 4, 5 months without anything, keep my appointments, take my antabuse, get my shot every month, and then... something different triggers me every time. I get overwhelmed with life, or relationships, or family, get depressed, anxious.... something and I cant fight it. I can push it away for a week or two, but eventually I still end up slipping. 

I'm a week sober, again, for the umpteenth time, and I really am motivated to never, ever touch the stuff again, but this isnt the first time I've ever been this motivated, but this is the first time that I'm thinking maybe I need more help. 

I've been looking into inpatient programs in my area, but my problem is I lost my job after my last relapse (before this one), and I dont have private health insurance anymore. My credit is garbage, and I dont have the money for self pay. Medicaid doesn't cover inpatient care, just outpatient and detox, which I've been doing, I've done, and I need more. But $15,000+ for a 30 day program is astronomical. 

I've called everyone I can think of. State funded rehab is on a minimum 6 month waitlist, most of the private places only have like 5 grant/scholarship beds, and they're on multiple waitlists.

I've called literally everyone, up to and including different charities (To write love on her arms, 10000 beds, etc) and I cannot figure out how anyone manages to afford this. It's getting so discouraging and I dont know where else to turn. I've called literally every rehab within a 100 mile radius of me, and I dont want to go further than that because I'd like my daughter to be able to visit me.

Help! Anyone know of any other grants, charities, or places I can turn? I feel like I've exhausted all my options, and it really sucks that I want help, NEED help, and desperate for help, and am being told ""maybe in 6 months."" This shit is ruining my life, and I seriously want to be done."
alcoholism,,"23 year old brother, alcohol and a downward spiral. Awful everything. Tonight I confronted my 23 year old brother about his drinking problem. He's a binge drinker when he drinks, and has threatened suicide at least once while drunk while also becoming violent. The last two weeks he's missed work because he got drunk the night before, and he's very close to losing his job. He has a family that depends on him but he seems to have chosen alcohol over himself and everybody that cares about him. Tonight I confronted him; I asked him to meet with me to talk about this but he refused. I went to his house and he was home with his family. The discussion became heated; I approached it us caring for his well-being. But we set some hard lines, I go with him next week to a chemical dependency assessment, or the next time he's drunk, I'm calling the cops so he can detox in the holding cell. He was very defensive which led to him being angry. I spoke passionately with a raised tone of voice. He wouldn't invite me into his home, so we spoke on his front porch him riding the front door to create a barrier between us. He was defiant the entire time, minimizing his behavior and saying he doesn't have a problem but is going tomorrow to get antidepressants. 

This was just awful, I hate this stress as I already lead a stressful life as a full-time grad student and working full-time in a hospital setting.

Will I experience withdrawal? Or would that be if I was drinking heavily daily ?"
alcoholism,,"Moderation rather than quitting? I know in the AA circle this is a super taboo subject, but has anyone tried and succeeded in moderating rather than abstinence?

I'm not asking this because I WANT to carry on drinking, but I've spent several years being told total abstinence is the only way if you're an alcoholic. This has lead to me abstaining maybe for a week, sometimes two weeks then inevitably caving in and drinking. With that drink comes intense guilt because I've 'ruined' my sobriety, and what do I do to handle that guilt? Of course I start drinking again. It's been an endless cycle for the past 5 years.

For the first time I decided to seek outside help for my alcoholism! I met with a really lovely (and eccentric) doctor today who explained that for some people, moderation can be better rather than totally quitting. I explained my situation and he said, this time, don't tell yourself you can never drink again. Say 'I will only drink once every two weeks'. If I can manage that, then great, if I can't then we can work on abstinence. 

Just wondering if anyone else who has been an alcoholic for several years had any luck with moderation?

I have expressed my concerns to my doctors numerous times that my anxiety is unbearable and I'll go into straight panic attack and they just say you have an addictive personality and cant help you so it's a vicious cycle of trying to keep my anxiety down and coming off alcohol, I resorted to lying and saying I've been sober for months but I'm labeled as an addict forever now

I am about to hit 96 hours since I stopped drinking.  I am doing this on my own while trying to keep my regular work schedule.  

I am experiencing extreme depression. My productivity has completely ground to a halt and I think it's the depression that is hanging me up. I was expecting my withdrawal problems to peak at 72 hours.

alcoholism,,"Withdrawal Timelines Iâ€™m just wondering how long it takes for withdrawal symptoms to kick in. I know it can vary based on age, genetics, consumption patterns, length of alcohol abuse, fitness, whether or not you have been prescribed meds to aid in withdrawal, etc.

That being said, is there a certain point in time - in terms of hours - when you *generally* know your withdrawal will not be severe (or you may not have any withdrawal at all)? I have read varying timelines, but most suggest youâ€™ll be feeling it within 6-12 hours.  How accurate is this?

Iâ€™m just curious what your personal experiences have been.

alcoholism,,"Please allow me to introduce myself... 
Hi everyone.  Iâ€™m new here and I am what you would call a functional alcoholic.  Iâ€™ve been gradually cutting down for 5 years now and am now 7 months sober, with 3 binges prior to that in the year 2019.  That was the year I decided I really needed to make a more significant change and that even drinking once a week or once a month is too much for me.  I will never not be a heavy drinker and have decided that abstinence is the best path for me.

Going back to 2015, I was getting into a pattern where I was drinking 4-5 days a week.   I can remember finishing my first half marathon and then getting drunk that night to celebrate.  And then drinking a case of beer the next day, knowing I had to work the next day.  Iâ€™d started to find ways to sneak it in on weeknights and could function the next day.

By that point I was up from 2 days a week just a year prior.  Iâ€™m quite regimented and routinized and always believed and loved by what an old friend had told me:  â€˜keep it to the weekendsâ€™. And I mostly had donâ€™t that but 5 years ago it was beginning to get bad.  Even when I was only drinking 2 days a week, it was always heavy drinking and almost always alone.  Once I discovered drinking alone, in my early 30â€™s when I moved to a town where I didnâ€™t know anyone, thatâ€™s when I began drinking almost exclusively alone.  And Iâ€™m able to hide it very well, being quite mild mannered.  Iâ€™m like Clark Kent and my alter ego isnâ€™t superman, heâ€™s a closet alcoholic.

I have more to say but Iâ€™m new to reddit and social media and donâ€™t quite know what is an acceptable level of information to get started with.  My wife told me I should start journaling and maybe this is my way of doing that.  I live quite a lonely life (a result of the drinking, really) and Iâ€™m still processing what my life can look like sober.  Iâ€™m here because it would be great to have some support and people to talk to.  I have a tendency to do most things alone and this is something I donâ€™t want to do alone.  Maybe I can be helpful to other people going through similar things to me.  Maybe there will be times when I need someone to reach out to.  Maybe this is the step that will get me to AA, I donâ€™t know.  I need help to stop romanticizing or getting nostalgic for the good times, or mourning the loss of my former best friend.  Turns out my best friend was a lying SOTB!  My real motivation also has to do with how I feel the next day(s) after drinking.  Iâ€™m grouchy and really quite crappy to my family.  I donâ€™t like living the lie anymore and I want to model the best behaviour I can for my child.

Everything in my life seems to be screaming for me to stop.  After one of the 3 binges I had last year I was walking through an alley and saw something shiny.  I was going to leave it.  My subconscious hoped that it was an Alcoholics Anonymous ring...I donâ€™t even know if there is such a thing.  The shiny thing turned out to be a ring with the serenity prayer on it.  Think what you want, but putting it on every day gives me strength!  We see what we want to see...

alcoholism,,"So my husband recently came to me and said heâ€™s an alcoholic. I am really proud of him. At the same time, I am disturbed at the amount of lying and hiding it he has done - I had no idea. I mean, I knew he liked to drink but it appeared to me he only had a few drinks on fridays and Saturdays. Evidently he waits until I go to bed every night and gets hammered.

He said he wants to get sober and that his addiction is at the root of every problem in his life, which makes sense now that I know. Heâ€™s gained weight, his mental health has STEEPLY declined, he never feels good, he struggles to wake up in the morning and get to work on time...We have been fighting for years about what I have perceived to be his laziness and inability to improve his lifestyle, so this is a bit of a revelation.

alcoholism,,"Looking for Dutch people who are addicted Hi all,

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

If you want to know more about these documentaries, or when you want to contact me, you can send me a PM."

alcoholism,,"Can support groups do more harm than good? Ok so I have a brother whos a fairly heavy drinker when he can afford it. Every payday the first thing he does is go to the liquor store, buy a 12 pack and drink it, then a few hours later cab back to the liquor store for more. This can repeat upto 3 times a night until hes broke. My family that is familiar with his drinking (myself, my sister, and my mother) have stopped doing anything that will help him get alcohol in any way shape or form. For example we no longer lend him cash as we know where that will go, we don't give him lifts to the liquor store, etc. Now this is where the support group comes in, I'm not sure exactly what is said there although he has pridefully told me on more than one occasion that the group seems to boil down to patting each other on the back and making each other feel better about relapsing with regularity.

Last night my brother got paid so you guessed it, binge drinking going on as I type! Well today my sister called me and we got talking and my concerns about the 'support' group came forth, she went on to inform me how when drunk he has texted her to put her down because his group says his life would be perfect if it wasn't for her. He has said similar things to my mother, and on one occasion where I dared to stand up for my mom he said as much to me. What I'm gathering from him is that this group is enabling him where we have stopped, he gets to be the victim and we (his family) are the victimizers. I'm at wits end and can not take it much longer as I live with him, I have my own problems (severe depression) that require counseling for me to work through and he keeps adding to them to the point where half my sessions are working through what he keeps dumping on me.

My question is that is this a normal situation for support groups? Do they normally make things worse before improving the situation? I mean I'm glad he's taking steps to deal with his problem but between the books they convince him to buy, the group itself, and the counselor he sees maybe once a month nothing is changing."

alcoholism,,"Is my dad an alcoholic or an angerholic? Maybe Iâ€™m being gaslit to second guess myself. For many years my dad has denied he is an alcoholic because he doesnâ€™t drink every day. On average twice a week, and I think he only has one or two mixed drinks. Despite the seemingly small quantity, it is obvious when he drinks. His face and attitude change and many conflicts arise. He is prone to get in arguments with (by putting people down) and swear at them, etc after he drinks. Thereâ€™s just a change in the vibe and itâ€™s joticeable after a life of dealing with it. He doesnâ€™t even have to say anything to anyone but we will know because of his mannerisms. 

When Iâ€™ve told him he has an alcohol problem, he denies it. I know the truth, really, heâ€™s quite obviously an alcoholic to me, because I know he canâ€™t go without it. I once emptied his liquor cabinets when I was fed up and after he freaked out about it he was better for a short time before he re stocked them. Then the cycle continues.

Itâ€™s  insane to see how he uses drinking as an outlet for
The anger he keeps cultivating. His worse addiction is anger and alcohol is just a side note. 

Iâ€™m thinking of going to al-anon because itâ€™s too much to cope with now without skills and reacting badly to it just spirals situations worse. I guess Iâ€™m wondering if I woild he out of place there sharing this when itâ€™s not even really alcohol. Alcohol is just a trigger. Itâ€™s
the anger."
alcoholism,,"Should I try the Sinclair Method Over the last two years, my drinking had increased a lot. I went from drinking every couple of weeks to drinking most days of the week without being to moderate. November of 2019 I drank so much that I blacked out and apparently tried to jump out of moving car and wound up in an inpatient hospital with a .35 ABV. My wife was extremely supportive and we agreed no more drinking. I went 50 days before drinking again, and now I'm at 55 days since drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have  cravings, but only when things get hard in life. Nothing like before. I enjoy a good beer, and I would love to find a way to drink in moderation in social settings, vacation, etc, but I'm afraid to bring this method up to my wife after all that shes been through. She's right when she says every time I take and break and then try to moderate it never works. Maybe the Sinclair Method can make me a normal casual drinker again? What say you? Any experience with it?"
alcoholism,,"It's only a matter of time til I get fired I'm a web developer and I can pretty regularly work from home. However, I have this terrible habit of doing shots throughout the day while I'm on the clock.  I drink pretty regularly and it takes a good bit now a days for me to get really wasted.  Yesterday I had no scheduled meetings and figured I could do a couple rounds while I worked.  My manager pings me and says I need to join a call.  Oh Christ.  I'm quite a few shots deep and I would be amazed if they couldn't tell.

I was sending e-mails, interacting in group chats and this morning I woke up terrified of what I might have said.  It's just before 5am and I've been in a panic for the past 3 hours.  I finally got the courage to remote into my work computer and read everything. 

For the most part, everything seems okay.  There was one thing I was pretty adamant about being right when I clearly was not, but I could play that off as confusion.  I'm finally starting to calm down a little.

alcoholism,,"Drinking problem, abstinence vs moderation? Earlier this month, drank entirely too much while out with wifeâ€™s friends, after a stressful day at work at the hospital. Wife drove us home, once at home, we got into an argument which ended in me calling her a bad name. She left the house at that point. We spent some time apart over the next few weeks, and decided to work on this together, and moved all back into our home. However, she fully thinks I have a drinking problem, one In which moderation isnâ€™t an option for her, basically because she is scared of this happening over again. And to that point, I feel like this has happened 3-4 times a year over the past 2 years or so. My drinking habit, honestly 2-3 nights a week, 4-6 beers typically, that oddball night every 3-4 months of drinking in excess, where the night before is a little fuzzy, nothing outrageous as far as any legal trouble, financial trouble etc. Have noticed that usually the excess drinking occurs when we are out in a group setting. I truly feel like that drinking is not the problem, but I have agreed to abstain at this time, and seeing a licensed counselor for evaluation soon. Can any one give me insight on what to expect? I have done all of the online self exams, for example the CAGE, AUDIT, MAST. They all end up saying Iâ€™m not an alcoholic, but have a moderate drinking problem. Have tried to cut back before, around September last year and this was the first time things got out of control since then. I feel like if I can talk with a counselor that, possibly they can show me a system that works for me, and with cutting back my wife will feel at ease, and I also can enjoy the occasional beverage with friends etc. what do you guys think?"
alcoholism,,"How much did/do you drink in a day/evening? Hi Iâ€™m in the UK.

I am an alcoholic. Been drinking heavily since 2003. Female mid 40s. I am looking to reduce and then stop my drinking. I currently drink 75 units a week.... vodka - mixed with tonic water (I only have one night a week off (Wednesday or Thursday), and one night a week maybe 7 units, due to morning commitments on 2 days). 

I tried going cold turkey for a week, October of last year. This was the longest I had gone without a drink, in 12 years! As youâ€™d expect, it was excruciating! I felt good physically after day 3. But the thought of no drink each evening after that, sent me in to a massive panic!! I got to end of day 6 and then drank my usual amount and the relief was out of this world!!!! (Obviously this is, I expect, completely normal alcoholic feelings!!!!)

I cannot sleep when I donâ€™t drink - but this is not primarily because I drink on the other nights . 
I have had problems with insomnia all my life - even as a small child in the late 70s! 

I also have problems with feeing like I am so inadequate as I only work 2 days a week due to health issues and depression etc and also as mum to one teen I donâ€™t have much to do during the day so just clean my house, visit friends, 
and also get involved with charity work 6 hours a week. 

Anyway . I would love to reduce gradually to 55 units a week and then maybe 45 units by Christmas.... and so on ....

To you who are managing this or have managed this ... How did you do it without completely losing your sanity? 

Thanks"

Heâ€™s an alcoholic and hid it from me until it was too late. He masked his history of unemployment with excusesâ€”always playing the victim. He masked his history of failed relationships with incredible women with excusesâ€”always playing the victim. 

Iâ€™m an idiot for believing him. 

I sit here with the ring he put on my finger... knowing our save the dates are out...so angry. Because, as a consultant I canâ€™t babysit his sobriety because I travel for work. Because, my absence leads to his no-shows at work and ability to lie to me. Because, his no-shows at work lead to his lay-offs and his alcoholism leads him to believe its everyoneâ€™s fault but his. 

Iâ€™m mad because he IS a good guy...except for when he drinks and he doesnâ€™t drink when Iâ€™m present. Iâ€™m mad because he told me that he had his shit together and wasnâ€™t a â€˜fixer upperâ€™ because Iâ€™ve had my share of those and only wanted an equal.  Iâ€™m mad because heâ€™s a fucking liar. 

Iâ€™m mad because I straight up told him the wedding was off if he drank again. My first fucking trip? Heâ€™s MIAâ€”not answering texts or calls. His iPhone location is home. That means he went and bought booze while I was on my first flight. And now heâ€™s fucking drunk.

But i always drink on evenings 7 days a week. I canâ€™t name a night I have not gone to bed buzzed if not sighing drunk as I turn off the lap top for bed. I wake up the next morning because I always make sure I get at least 8 hours of sleep rested but throw up a lot after my shower and say hey letâ€™s make tonight not the same. I go for runs and what not feel better every maybe 1 time a week. But I always feel the need to drink after work because Iâ€™m bored. Iâ€™m not interested in what people say or do around me unless Iâ€™m buzzed. Which has basically got me to my high paying job which is sad.  Maybe a functioning alcoholic at this point? If anybody has hit this point and just stopped how? I could probably run half marathons and be super fit beyond what I am if I just went for a run instead of drinking and watching tv after work. It just is easier and more satisfying after a long day.
alcoholism,,"TIL that humanity is really just an absolute fuck-ton of semi-hairless sentient apes, trying their best to stumble through an increasingly complex environment that they are increasingly less equipped to deal with. Long read, but I mostly just want to write it out.

I just convinced my little brother to voluntarily get locked up in an inpatient detox center. I went with him and helped fill out the paperwork.

He has been to one once before that traumatized him, but he trusts me enough to go even though he's scared shitless and essentially believes he's stepping into a hell that he can't leave.

Words can never express how much I hope I made the right call. 

He was trying to detox at my house, we went through 6 days of ever-increasingly worse symptoms, all while he was holding himself to 20 standard drinks per day so that he doesn't die.

He is a god-damned warrior. Eventually it got to the point where he couldn't keep any liquids down at all, even alcohol, so we supplemented with low doses of benzos to keep him from going into full blown withdrawals until he could keep something down. 

I was with him night and day caring for him, watching him suffer and wishing I could make it easier on him.

I told him on the night of the 6th day that he needed to go to the detox center.

Then, the morning of the 7th day, he was doing so much better I was reconsidering. Back and forth, back and forth I weighed the cost of potential trauma with the possibility that he could die in my care because I'm not a medical professional. Maybe this was finally the turning point? Would I be wasting thousands of dollars of his money and abandoning everything right when the whole goddamn thing was almost over?

I don't know.

I never will know.

I feel like I abandoned him when he needed me the most, *again*, just like everyone else. Seriously, he has had an absolute nightmare of a life, a lot of which I never realized until he started telling me about some of it. Some of it he says is too horrible to tell.

He has never hurt a person except in self defense, and the world and every medical professional or therapist he's ever told the truth to has let him down...even me. What a fucked up situation.

I still made the best call I could. I just hope it was the right one."

this is my first post in this community and it's not easy for me to write about this topic. I don't even know if I should be worried about it, but something doesn't feel right about my alcohol consumption. 

For context, I'm a 27 years old Italian woman, I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation, even though I have a good job and a generally ""normal"" life. But I'm not so sure about what's healthy and not, anymore. 

In the last year I've started drinking alone, just one beer during happy hours, but in the last two months I started feeling like that one beer has become, like, necessary to get relaxed after a workday. I usually eat something while drinking, but as you can imagine bars don't have much healthy food during happy hours - so I usually end up binge eating french fries and junk food while drinking. And I've started feeling like also the food is a way to release some stress. Sometimes I find myself looking forward to that beer and the junk food (the food plays an important role I'm sure) like that is the most pleasurable moment of the day.  

In social settings I don't drink much and I feel ashamed of my ""lonely beers"". 

Also, I'm going off my antidepressants this month (this has been programmed with my psychiatrist) and I'm having some panic attacks due to the lower antidepressant dose, and yesterday when I had anxiety I felt the need to ""drink it away"". I didn't, but now I'm scared. 

I'm terrified, I haven't told anyone about this and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just dramatizing a normal drinking habit?

The only way I could achieve this is by avoiding alcohol related scenarios altogether.  Stopped going to weekend parties, work events, birthdays etc. No matter what my friends plan, it somehow always ends up with liquor. Also the peer pressure is super painful ( this one time, I secretly told the bartender that I am a month pregnant so that he serves me water all night. Which he was very understanding about). Now, most of my friends don't call me as often and the remaining I avoid owing to their partying. Which is leading to a very non existent social life for me.

Fast forward to age 12/13 I noticed my parents drinking excessively to the point they'd pass out, it was more my mom passing out than my dad, but I still thought it was normal. I was a very isolated child. I wasn't allowed to go out etc so therefore I thought my familys drinking was normal.

I used to drink heavily and decided to quit about 4 years ago, i saw that i was heading towards problem drinking and stopped. I did not find it particularly difficult once i made my mind up but im sure if i had kept at it that could have been different. Now the thought of alcohol sickens me. I attribute it to finally seeing that alcohol was stealing my weekends and that it is really just a nasty drug that is somehow socially acceptable. Anyways my brothers and i friend group from growing up are all extremely heavy drinkers,  to be honest i was no angel but iam shocked at the amount they drink every day they seem to universally start drinking around noon and take back at least 10 drinks before i head out, i am sure they stay up much later drinking heavily. I have more or less cut that group out of my life as it is depressing and obnoxious to spend time with them.

My brother is extremely sociable and is either using socializing to cover unhealthy drinking or just naturally is social and drinks heavily while doing it. He has expressed interest in reducing his drinking or quitting which makes me really excited. Anyways my question is has anyone had any luck either waking up a group of people to how unhealthy and abnormal their drinking is? They are in their early 30s so in my estimation its way past youthful antics and more problematic, i havent really called them out on it. Also is it possible for someone who is trying quit / cutback to hang out with active alcoholics or heavy drinkers with out relapsing into heavy drinking? Because they have a group or culture of heavy drinking is it making it worse? It is very weird to live in a world outside of their drinking only to sociallize with them and be shocked. Maybe because they only spend time with heavy drinkers they dont see what everyone else does? It is really starting to affect their cognition and health."
alcoholism,,"What do I do for my boyfriend when he arrives home from detox? Any advice on what to do for him and/or something to give him?

alcoholism,,"I have a drinking problem The title itself I know is true but i don't believe it for some reason.  It's something I've never said out loud before and something I hide from everyone around me.  Something tells me I'm out of control but I've been rationalizing for so long that I don't even trust myself.  

I have been downing at least 1.75 liters of whiskey every four to five days for at least 2 years.   I've always told myself it's a normal amount.  But I know that it's not beneficia to my lifel.  

Usually I only drink at night but sometimes I'll day drink.  I've tried to stop because I have an extensive history of losing my mind and acting like a complete fool.  I've completely embarrassed myself on numerous occasions.  You'd think that would be enough to stop.  

I've got legal trouble due to my actions from drinking.  I've got people I love concerned about me anytime I order a beer with dinner.  I've got a baby due in a week and I refuse to allow myself to be drunk around him absolutely.  The problem is I keep telling myself I'm going to stop but I seem to never do.  Anxiety and life hit and I feel compelled to numb the enormous amount of pain.

I'm so embarrassed of myself for this.  I want to feel like a good person again.  I know alcohol only brings out the worst in me.  Any advice would be appreciated."
alcoholism,,"What are alcoholics thinking ? First off I want to say I hope I don't offended anyone and I'm sorry if I do that is not my intention. 

I would just like to know what my mom is thinking and I've been trying to see things her way but I just can't figure it out. My mom's been an alcoholic for 20 years now and suffered a lot of abuse from my alcoholic father growing up. So I can understand in a way how and why she started drinking. But what really baffles me is these last few years even when her kids and other family are super supportive she still continues to drink. She's been to rehab a few times failed the first time and completed the last two. This last one she completed she started drinking the next day. She also has a lot of medical problems arising due to the drinking. I just can't understand when why when everything's going well she still continues to drink? Because when she starts drinking she gets super drunk everyday, she can't control her liquor and causes a lot of drama. This causes my family to stop talking to her and it makes her isolated and upset. 

TLDR; Why does my mom continue to drink when she knows it'll just make her life worse? Also why does she always drink till she's super drunk causing drama and not control it instead?"

I've asked him plenty of times to at least cut back. And everytime he tells me he will and does for a few days and then goes back to his normal amount and sometimes even more like last night. His excuse is is that its winter and he's bored. And that hes not working and stressing out about stuff. Anyways, hes sitting here telling me I'm I'm ng a child about how I'm upset about him and his drinking and that I shouldn't of made him sleep on the couch last night or gave him the cold shoulder this morning. Says I was giving him attitude the whole morning and I asked how because I wasn't even talking to him and he says yeah that's attitude. Anyways the day goes on we go out shopping and he asks if I'm going to hate him all day (has been asking me all day about it) and then tells me that I can't treat him like shit just because I don't like his drinking. I said not talking to you isnt treating you like shit. And then I ask him why he has to keep bringing the whole fight up if he wants to get over it. And he says I am over it I just don't understand why you have to be a child about it. I said so what.. me not talking to you because I wasn't ready to talk is me being a child? Me being upset about your drinking after you told me so many times you would work on it is me being a child? And then he says that I'm treatjng him like shit because I haven't hugged or kissed him today. I said so, I'm just not ready yet. (Still upset about the drinking) and he says yeah that's you treating me like shit. 
I'm just over it. We've been together for two years now. And he has a child and I have a child. I don't know what to do anymore."
alcoholism,,"Brother is buying alcohol for Underage Cousin My (23M) little brother(22M) has been a drinker since high school. Recently, he was living in a trap house with a couple of his friends and they would drink themselves silly and trash the place. His lease just ended and I offered to move into a place with him. Heâ€™s a goodhearted kid and I feel like if heâ€™s around people that donâ€™t party as much he might mellow out. 

We just finished moving in last night and itâ€™s a nice place. He had a shot or two while moving in but other than that he was civil. But then around 11pm, my underage cousin (16M) and a couple of his friends stopped by and my brother handed them a case of Coronas and sent them on their way. I tried confronting him about it but he wasnâ€™t interested in talking about it. 

This worries me greatly. Iâ€™m already scared for my brothers well-being but the fact that heâ€™s now getting our younger cousin into drinking too is too much for me. And now that weâ€™ve just moved into a new place, I canâ€™t deal with this if heâ€™s going to keep doing this to our cousin and himself. I donâ€™t know what to do or how to approach this without him blowing me off like he usually does."

alcoholism,,"How to become sure if your spouse is an alcoholic or beginning to become one? Hi everyone! I recently got married to the love of my life and we have been in a relationship for more than 10 years. I always knew he likes to drink and he would drink 1 - 2 times in a week. Some months before our wedding, he reduced his drinking to drinking once in 2 weeks. I was extremely happy to see this change. But post our wedding, he's been drinking 3 - 4 times in a week!!! He has some reason or the other. Often the reason is that he is under a lot of work pressure (which is true) and due to that he often comes home late from work in a drunk state. When he brings home office work, he brings along an alcohol of his choice and drinks a few pegs while doing his office work. I have also noticed that whenever he meets his close friends, that meeting is never sober. He and his friends will definitely drink. He also drinks with me at home when he is cooking a non-vegetarian dish. I have seen that alcohol often does not have a good effect on him. After drinking, he becomes unexpectedly over-romantic, egoistic, hyper, does everything slow, gets easily ticked off and often repeats his talks. All this drives me nuts and these habits are beginning to hamper our relationship, his mood and behaviour. Everytime I have a conversation with him about this problem, he vows that he will soon quit it. Those vows don't seem to be getting fulfilled. I am confused about what I am dealing with and how to help him overcome this?"

For context, my big brother is a Big alcoholic, to thÃ© point that i don't know if he can je cured, and my mom has a pretty bad form of Alzheimer. And when i'm drunk, i usually text girls i had a crush on...

So, for those reasons, i completly cut alcohol out of my life, it was great because i didn't feel the need to drink. But last night, i wanted to go to the bar, drink only soft(non alcoholic beverages, that's how we call them in France) and maybe meet a girl, i wasnt tempted by alcohol

But i met a pub friend, i'm a sailor in the navy, and he is an officer, he's one of the reason i joined the navy. And when i told him that it was five weeks since my last drink, he ordered me a beer and told me to drink it.

I'm pretty weak when it's social pressure, so i drank, and then i drank again.

So, i had a five weeks streaks, it was great, i drank, didn't do anything bad, but i feel like shit, and lent jjst started.

alcoholism,,"Fiance experiencing ""trips""...what is this? Hey, all. My fiance and I live apart.
She's almost 30, 90lbs soaking wet, is on trokendi for migraines, sometimes eats sometimes doesn't, and has a lot of depression and anxiety. She has been liquor-free for a year.

When she was 18, she could drink 1.5 Liters of vodka straight in one evening. Blackout drunkenness was the norm, from what she told me. She quit liquor a year ago after leaving a dude who was abusive when drunk. 

Last night she took a single shot of vodka, and experienced nothing short of euphoria. She was instantly drunk - I heard the change on the phone as we spoke. She described feeling like she's in the clouds, floating, and peaceful.

Tonight she took a shot while texting me about depression. The same euphoria came back. But she's also seeing rainbow everything when she closes her eyes, and has random childhood music in the background every time she closes her eyes.

alcoholism,,"Advice please :/ So my mom has been â€œtryingâ€ to recover for the past 2 years and always stops for a little and goes downhill again. Sheâ€™s in a AA program but it doesnâ€™t seem to really help her. This January she didnâ€™t drink the whole month then she relapsed and ever since then sheâ€™s just been drinking very often. There would rarely be weeks where she would not drink. Now sheâ€™s at the point where she drinks and tryâ€™s to play it cool like she didnâ€™t. And every time you call her out on it she does the same bs. She starts making up lies and talks bad on others (I guess to make her feel like sheâ€™s innocent) . And she never owns up to it anymore, shes been secretly drinking almost everyday now. What makes it even worse is that she takes anxiety medicine. So she gets really crazy. The stories and lies she says is ridicules.  

My biggest worries is that she will either lose everything in her life because of this, get her self killed, or someone else in my family injured/ killed. 
Every day she has to pick my sisters up from school and she drives drunk there often. No one can ever notice she drank so she gets away with it. But when your in the car with her you can definitely notice by the way sheâ€™s talking and beeping at cats that beep at her. If she keeps this up she will lose my sisters custody, her job, maybe even her husband (my step dad). everyoneâ€™s sick of it. Seems like she doesnâ€™t want to quit no more.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Iâ€™m tired of dealing with all this, and the rehab place that I looked at in my area (Richmond, VA) is very expensive I could never afford it. Is there any free rehab centers in VA that you guys know of? Or if not what would you do in my situation.

alcoholism,,"DT symptoms most hangovers? Hey all, couldn't find this in the search or on google, let me know if there is a better place to post.

Around 5 years ago I started to notice that the day after socializing with a lot of drinking, my hangovers started to be different. No longer just body and head feeling shitty and nausea, now I started to get these intense, all night panic attacks. I'll just lie in bed trembling and sweating, and while I normally have an anxiety narration in the back of my head, now it starts getting too loud to ignore and often sounds like there is really someone in the room yelling or saying something into my ear. I also float in and out of short ""dreams"" but have trouble discerning them from reality. This usually lasts until 5 or sometimes 8am, at which point I can finally sleep for a couple hours. Some time ago a friend mentioned these symptoms sounded a lot like DT, and when I read about it I thought ""yes this is it"". However, all the literature I've read suggests you need to be drunk for several days on end, then quit for several days, then these symptoms occur. For me, it can be brought on by one heavy night of drinking followed by one day of not drinking (typically just focus on hydrating when I feel this shitty). Two days of binge drinking in a row guarantee I will get these symptoms, and I think severity scales with amount of drinks. Has anyone experienced this? Is there a way to combat it? Could I maybe have alcohol intolerance, or is this more related to my anxiety problems? I realize the smart thing would be quit or significantly reduce intake, and I may have to do that, but that would make my social life stressful and I may just become reclusive.

Background: I'm 30yo male, have been drinking since I was \~13. For the past few years it's been about 3 drinks per night and binge one or two days during the weekend, with this occurring Sun-Mon."

A little about myself: Been drinking since college, Iâ€™m now 30. My situation is a little different from most. I donâ€™t have the urge, I donâ€™t drink during the week or drink alone. But if Iâ€™m at a social outing and any kinda alcohol is involved, 8 times outta 10, Iâ€™m going to get blackout drunk. This doesnâ€™t happen often, maybe 4 times/yr but every time, I do something crazy. I can be violent when drunk, very rude, and lose all self control. Iâ€™ve got into plenty of bar fights, heated arguments with loved ones, and totally embarrassed my wife time and time again. 

This sucks because these moments have started to define me. Even if I drink with friends and we have a chill night, I am still treated like the guy to watch out for. My wife starts to get pissed at me while Iâ€™m drinking even if I havenâ€™t even got drunk fully. People start to say things like â€œmaybe you ought to slow downâ€. These things really piss me off when Iâ€™m not even drunk yet. 

I enjoy drinking socially and it seems like every social event I attend, everyone there is drinking. They are also drunk/tipsy but Iâ€™m the one that over does it every single time. What is my issue?

alcoholism,,"Bit of a random one this...paint Bit of background first. I'm a recovering alcoholic and depressive who has been going through a cycle of relapse/recovery for a couple of years now.

I currently live in a council flat, which kindly paints their properties white to make it easier to customise as the tenant pleases.

Prior to my birthday in November I was asked by my sister if there was anything I wanted and I suggested she could get me the paint, saying I was going to leave the bedroom (it's carpeted, I can't be done with the hassle) and bathroom (happy for it to be white) and wanted the living room grey and one wall of the kitchen orange.

This was during a period of sobriety and was told by my mum that we would go down and select exact colours at the weekend. This never happened and I was told later in the week: ""oh we'll have to drop off the paint.""  They'd chosen the colours.

Anyway, I've had some bad times over the last three months (not because of the paint ðŸ˜…) and have only recently reconciled things with my family. Today the paint was brought up. 

Firstly, am I a dick for being kind of pissed off about this? I feel I'm right but also feel like I'm a dick for  being pissed off.

What if I fucking *hate* the colours?  Maybe they're fine but what if not? I'll feel obligated to use them anyway. I'm the one that lives here. This is my home.

I'm not going to complain about this.  I've put my family through way worse shit over the years.  Hell, chances are it will be fine, but if not? I don't want to go to all that effort and work painting, just for my reward to be a permanent, constant reminder of a time my family upset me...that definitely won't help my mental state."
alcoholism,,"â€œ Youâ€™re not an alcoholic so I wouldnâ€™t worry too much about it.â€ A little back story: 
Iâ€™m in my late 20â€™s and began drinking at 21. I never thought I had a problem until two years ago. I began drinking before work (like three shots) and drinking after work. I would drinking before I would go hang out with friends. I would start drinking at noon. For the most part, I thought I was just â€œfunctioning alcoholicâ€ and that most people were that way. 
Then I dated someone that abstained from alcohol and I began to realize how much I truly drank. I made some attempts to cut back but it never stuck. Then I got sick to where I was suppose to refrain from drinking to get better and I didnâ€™t. I got really sick after that and then decided to stop. As soon as I got healthy again, I went back to drinking and steadily got back to drinking before work, hanging out, multiple drinks a day.
I began my attempts to stop drinking last year. I tried to quit three times.

My second attempt, about 8 months ago, I was feeling really down about myself. I talked to my best friend and mentioned I was worried about how much I drank and that I wanted to stop.
She said, â€œ Youâ€™re not an alcoholic so I wouldnâ€™t worry too much about it.â€

I attempted to stop drinking for a third time last December and I ended up caving after three weeks. When I told my best friend, she didnâ€™t really say anything about it. We spent New Years Eve together, she asked me if I was drinking and I said yes. 
Thing is, what she said has really stuck with me. I donâ€™t know why but ever so often, I think about it and it sort of makes me upset. It makes me feel like, maybe I donâ€™t need to stop drinking. But then I want to and it makes me not want to tell her, or even hang out with her.

alcoholism,,"Week one of my lent promise &amp; days now without a drink. This is the longest I have gone without a single beverage in about 15 years. I have tried to do stints of no alcohol in the past but there were always cheats, I'd either be stoned out of my gourd half the time or convince myself that a pint or two with lunch didn't count. 33 more days to go, and I'm not certain I'll be a tee-totaler even if I make it all the way through, but if I can get myself back to a point of enjoying a drink or several for pleasure rather than to black out whole chunks of time I'll consider it a win. For anyone else out there trying something similar I wish you strength and fortitude.

Admins/Mods remove if inappropriate. 

So, I don't think I'm an alcoholic. Honestly I never did, I felt like I was told by many people that I was, or I simply felt like I needed to call myself an alcoholic so others wouldn't try to talk down to me for thinking I'm not. I had a DUI over a year ago, my second one actually. The first one was marijuana related. The second one was alcohol. I will admit, I was drinking way too much. I used alcohol and weed to tone the world out and numb myself. I dealt with many issues including physical and sexual abuse as a child from various family members, and those issues came to light in the last three years. Now, I've been in therapy for well over a year, I attended a year of AA, six months of which were court-ordered. I went over a year stone-cold sober and abstinent. I loved AA, and still love the idea behind it and the brotherhood you become part of. I still don't think I'm an alcoholic though. I've drank some beer here and there, weeks between each time. I've went several months since getting off probation without any alcohol, and it didn't make me feel bad or anything. When I have had a beer or two, it doesn't make me feel bad either and I have absolutely zero, nada, zip, NO desire to be drunk and belligerent. I don't feel like I'm doing anything bad, and I don't use any substance to numb myself nor do I feel like I need to. I don't feel like I'm some special exemption either, I just feel like a normal person, enjoying life and causing no harm. I don't feel like an alcoholic who thinks it's okay to have a drink or two and try to lie about it and hide it, I feel like I am in a good place for the first time in a long time, and it feels good. I do know that if my habits had continued though, heavy drinking and smoking, I don't think I would have made it or at least not be where I am now in life, I really have accomplished so much and I am so happy with where I am now. I wanted to share this with you all in case there is anyone else feeling the same way, or with the same experiences or any advice or wise words."
alcoholism,,"Coming up on two years sober.. Iâ€™m only 22 I feel like Iâ€™m â€œmissing outâ€ on nights out dancing with friends or a drink with dinner. Realistically, I know that I cannot handle just one, or two. It always turned into more, which would turn into blacking out every time with a bad ending each time. Fights, assaults, being taken advantage of, drugs, extremely dangerous situations etc. I started drinking heavy at 14 and it got progressively worse as I went through high school. I didnâ€™t drink everyday, I was more of an alcohol abuser. Once I started, I couldnâ€™t stop. 

Most people my age drink. Nearly everyone. Sometimes I will tag along for a night out but itâ€™s hard to enjoy it when everyone around is drunk and nearly 2am. 

My question is, what do you do for fun or to make you feel like you arenâ€™t missing out on your youth?"
alcoholism,,"Looking for advice about my brother. Hi reddit, longtime lurker here needing some help for my older brother.
I am the youngest of 3. I have two older brothers. My oldest brother is super successful and lives across the country, we (my other brother, mom, and dad) donâ€™t see him much besides on holidays. My middle brother (we will call him Sam) is struggling with alcohol addiction and is stuck in a depressive cycle because of it. It has cost him several jobs, relationships, and he has two aggravated DUIs. My family is at our breaking point dealing with him and his reluctance to address his problem.

Sam and I moved in together in 2015 after his seven-year relationship ended because of his drinking. I agreed to move in with Sam because my lease was ending and i was trying to do what i could to help my brother and my family. While we lived together I did my best to try to keep him sober but quickly learned that I was not able to do that no matter how much love and support I offered him. Unfortunately I became the middle-person between my mom and Sam - my mom would frequently reach out to me asking about the status of my brother and if he is sober. My mom and i are extremely close and talk everyday, and soon nearly all of our conversations became about Sam. i would alert her when Sam was not doing well and my mom and/or my dad would come over to our place and try to convince him to go to their house so they could keep an eye on him and prevent him from drinking. Looking back i see how severely dysfunctional and enabling this is, but we were honestly doing it out of pure concern for him and the desire to â€œsaveâ€ him. We had several huge family fights at me and Samâ€™s place, but Sam would eventually come around and thank me and my parents for trying to help him. 
Sam and I moved out in September 2019 - I moved in with my boyfriend and Sam moved in with a friend who has previously struggled with alcohol but is now sober. Ever since then Sam has been really out of control. He had the interlock taken off his car (he was mandated one after his DUIs but my family convinced him to put one back on after he was driving drunk). He lost his job due to drinking at work, got hired at a new job and lost it in the same week because he no-called-no-showed while he holed up in a motel and drank for two days straight. He went to inpatient rehab (for the second time) for 30 days and drank the day he got out. 

There are so many other things I could write about, but the reason for this post is to ask how to break the cycle of myself and my parents coming to Samâ€™s rescue. My mom always rescues Sam when he is spiraling out of control because she loves him and would do anything for him (and clearly has). It is so unfair to her. My mom has had multiple health problems over the years and is not in the greatest of health, and bringing on Samâ€™s problems certainly isnâ€™t helping. She is exhausted and exasperated and at her wits end as sheâ€™s done everything in her power to help but nothing works. My Dad tries to be supportive but is clearly fed up and wants nothing to do with Sam anymore. My Dad and Sam are starting to physically fight when Sam is drunk.

The most infuriating part of all of this is that Sam refuses to seek help. He has agreed to inpatient rehab but admits that he just goes through the motions so he can get out and drink. He has tried therapy a couple times but again, it seems like he doesnâ€™t truly open himself up and eventually stops going and claims it doesnâ€™t work. He says there is nothing he can do to stop, heâ€™s tried everything and nothing works. My heart breaks for my brother, but even more so for my parents. He is currently living at my parents house. 

Tl;dr: my brother is an alcoholic, my family and I are in a cycle of rescuing him and enabling him and we canâ€™t stop"
alcoholism,,"I was sober, drank again, then it almost killed me. Posting from this account, because I don't really use it. 

About a year ago, I wrote about how I had stopped drinking after getting acute pancreatitis (i'm very young). I wrote about my detox experience in the hospital, and I received a lot of positive feedback about being sober, though it was only for two weeks post my hospital experience. I felt really good about myself for a long time....and then I didn't.

I don't know what happened, or why I fell into a downward spiral, but I picked up drinking again. I told myself it would just be one or two drinks, and then I would stop. But one or two so quickly became 5 or 6, and then 5 or 6 became every day again. I felt like I couldn't stop, and I was so ashamed to ask anyone for help because they knew how it difficult it had been the first time, and would never have thought I'd do it again. I never thought I'd end up in the same place again.

And then in two weeks after that, I was in the hospital. Diagnosis: severe acute pancreatitis.

And then kidney failure. And liver failure.

I was dying.

And I was detoxing yet again, while dying, and all I could think of was how stupid I had been. How I thought I could have control and limit myself, and now here I was, dying of pancreatitis and organ failure at 22, because I thought I was smarter than my addiction. I think a lot of people think that. That they're smarter. I know now that I can't be.

I don't remember a lot of it. I was in the hospital for 34 days, and all of it was on a double dose of dilaudid, which is 10x stronger than morphine. For 19 days I wasn't allowed to drink water or eat anything. I had shakes, I had nightmares when I could sleep, and hallucinations when I couldn't. My heart rate was so high from detoxing and organ failure that I was put in the cardiac ward, with someone checking in on me every so often to make sure I didn't croak. 

At first, all my family visited me. Then slowly, they all stopped visiting until it was only my mom who would come during the day. She would sit and cry, leave, and come back the next day to do the same thing. I hated them for it at the time, but I understood much later that it was easier for them to accept I was dying when they didn't have to look me in the eyes.

Most of my experience was so hazy because of the pain meds. I felt worthless and empty, and just wanted it to be over with. Physically my body had given up on me, and mentally I had given up about 17 days in. I was tired, but I couldn't sleep. It was like being stuck in a fog with no lighthouse in sight. I just wanted it all to end. To finally die and let the tiredness take over in a different way.

And then it happened. In some respect, I still have trouble understanding it. For a brief moment, the fog had lifted, and I heard a man's voice in my head telling me that I was going to be safe, and it was time for me to fall asleep. I knew what it meant, because the feeling I had, was like I was falling asleep, but I knew I wasn't going to sleep. It was borderline euphoric, and all I wanted to do was grab hold of that feeling and let it wash me away.

But then a nurse came in. 

It was the end of her shift, she had said. She wanted to know how I was feeling. I told her. The voice I'd heard in my head, said it's okay to fall asleep now, and I was ready. She asked me if I felt afraid or scared. I said no. I didn't have an ounce of fear in my body. Though if I were to think about dying now, I'm terrified in all capacities. I wasn't then. I would later find out that she wouldn't have believed me if I was afraid. Guess it wasn't the first time she's heard something like it.

She sat beside my bed, and started telling my stories from her shift. Trying to get me to laugh. Played rock paper scissors. Showed me pictures of her dog on her phone. It took me a while to realize what she was even doing. She wasn't making sure I wasn't alone in my last moments, she was making sure I didn't fall asleep. 

She stayed by my side for 8 hours past her shift, well into the morning. Did everything possible to keep me awake, rubbed my arms roughly or tickled my feet whenever my eyes got heavy. Specialists on-call finally started coming around in the morning, poking and prodding me, and the urge to fall asleep in that same way I had briefly felt had dissipated. Some level of fear had come back, and I didn't want to die anymore. I was terrified of it again.

For some reason, after that day, I began to improve. My pancreatic enzymes went down, my liver enzymes started cruising to a healthier level. My kidneys started functioning better. In the end, I left the hospital with half a pancreas. But I left with something else too. Some sort of new motivation to give back in life.

I finished college. I got a job. I started volunteering and giving back. I've never looked at things the same way since then. I feel calmer, and don't have mood swings like I used to. Occasionally, I feel the urge to drink, but it dissipates as time goes on, because I know that I can't fully control my addiction, but I can prevent it from controlling me.

I still don't know who that nurse was. Maybe she wasn't even real. Sometimes I think it was God giving me one last chance. But I think that without her, I would have died that night.

It took me a long time to even talk about this. 

To admit that I felt I had not only failed myself in sobriety, but my friends and family too. I struggled for so long to tell myself that I was an addict. That this wasn't taboo. ""Its just college"" a lot of people said to me, ""It's normal to drink a lot"". But it's not normal, and its not just college. Young people can get addicted too. And it's so far from okay. It's so far from okay to normalize the behavior in young adults just because they are young.

It's been a year now. I haven't had a single sip of alcohol. And even as I type this, I feel like I'm questioning myself. If it'll actually help someone. But maybe it will, young or old. To know that they aren't alone, and that there are consequences for our actions. Maybe that there really is something out there for us, beyond life, that watches over us and helps us cross bridges that we don't think we can overcome. I crossed a barrier that I never thought I could get past, never thought I would ever be able to conquer.

I haven't looked back."
alcoholism,,"Cold Turkey? Can someone give me insight on going cold turkey? My girlfriend seems to think its the best idea but I hear its dangerous.   


Sometimes I'll go on a heavy binge for 3 days to a week, going through up to a fifth of vodka a day.

So Iâ€™ve never had the most healthy relationship with alcohol - ever. I donâ€™t drink too often, but when I do I drink to an extent I shouldnâ€™t - leaving me with crippling anxiety for days. I previously went out on the Saturday of last weekend, ended up waking up somewhere I shouldnâ€™t sorrounded by my exâ€™s friends and family. Because I was so anxious I then downed alcohol until I went downstairs so I could hide my anxiety. Iâ€™ve felt rotten since then - I went for a meal last night with my family but a lot of people I didnâ€™t know, because my anxiety was so bad before I went about it I drank some wine to see if it would chill me. I then realised that it was stupid and I was acting dependant so I made myself sick about 15 minutes later, I made sure all the wine in my system was out and went to the meal sober.

My question is - where do I get help? Does anybody who has felt the way I do have a full recovery? In all honesty I do feel like cutting alcohol out of my life is the right thing for me to do - because all it does it cause me anxiety, and I tend to use it to hide my anxiety and fears - which is I know, really dangerous.

alcoholism,,"Hobbies For Staying Sober? Hi everyone.

I didn't know where to post this because I don't really consider myself an alcoholic per say but I am quite a heavy drinker and it's because I am bored.

I am in university and have 4 day weekends. When I was 19, I was pronounced legally blind and had to give up my license and job. As I was transitioning through life and getting rid of negativity and constructing a support system for my eye condition , I decided to leave my toxic ex and consequently, lost all of my friends (not so much friends after all!). Therefore, I am bored out of my mind, never go out and find myself drinking from Thursday night to Sunday night (I only drink in the evening)

However, I get wasted every night from Thursday to Sunday. I really need to find some solo hobbies that I can do in order to take my mind off the drinking. I've gained a substantial amount of weight after losing my job and it's mostly due to the drinking and the garbage I eat while I'm drunk (alcohol munchies)

I want to know what solo hobbies you all do to combat your alcohol cravings. Keep in mind that I am visually impaired and cannot drive (however I can see pretty good for someone who is legally blind)

Thanks!

alcoholism,,"Effects of sister's alcoholism led to a bad semester My situation for context:


So last Spring, my younger sister's alcoholism(9 years) finally got to me deeply. I was taking online classes to be with my family and help with my sister's 2 older daughters and newborn. During that time my sister relapsed hard. She drove drunk with them in the car, didn't wreck but had pulled over crying, a random stranger stooped and checked on her, took her and my niece's to her house, woman called my parents from sister's phone to tell them she has them safe!! Thank God for that woman. Then my sister became violent and beat on her fiance in front of my nieces and was arrested (again). She had to go to court for probation violation and jail time(previous DUI) Resulted in my nieces not being able to be alone with either of them which caused us to be primary caregivers. Then later my sister made accusations of me abusing her. First it seemed like sexual abuses accusations but later she said it was physical abuse. I never did any of those but I think it was my turn to be blamed for her alcoholism. She blamed my mother before. She then sent threats to kill me to protect our family from me, which is untrue. I always stood in the way when she tried to attack my mom and I received bruises and cuts from it. I was devastated, even writing this I am in tears. She really hurt me and it caused me to neglect my school. I should have dropped but I wasn't in a good mind. I talked to my advisor recently to apply for graduation (spring 2020 Yay!) and she was concerned about my bad semester. She asked what happened and I told her. She asked if I have documentation of these issues but I don't really have any besides police reports that only mention my sister. She then suggested I write the Dean of students and plead my case to remove the bad grades of that semester. 


My question:

Should I provide the police reports and conversations (texts) from my sister as documentation? I don't care if they don't accept my request but I figured I should try. Anyone have any suggestions? 


Ps: My sister is doing better and I am praying she continues to recover for my niece's sake."

I'm in therapy, and I've tried so hard to deal with my issues in other ways, but having a drink to soothe my panic was always a quick and easy solution.

2. I have no hobbies - when i was 14 yeas old, i think i was a gamer, but now i can play new game 10 - 15 max and im bored 
3. my income - my job provide my optimal income, with that i can live,but i cant make any savings
4. my friends - i dont get positive answer, when i say that i feel depressed, they answer is drink a little bit more  
5. my family- im last one who still live with my parents, even that im the oldest,  my youngest brothers are left home, now i got this feeling that i need to take care of our parents, because they are old and nobody takes care of them.

* in my family tree, there are always 1 person, who take care of parents, i know because i make my family tree(oldest one was in 1889) 

at my job parties every body makes fun with me, even call me ""big drinker"" in my native thong sounds better, because im 6'3 and drink more then my coworkers.  


i dont know how to stop drinking, i feel like that's the only think that keep me normal. i know that suicide is not answer, but i feel like its an option"
alcoholism,,"Just some advice from you champions Hey guys, Iâ€™ve been trying to quit drinking for a while now, itâ€™s a process and Iâ€™ve failed more times than I can count but whatever Iâ€™m still trying.
Iâ€™d like to hear how people handle situations that are always the cause of why I drink. 
What do you do when your friends invite you out or come to yours and drink? 
What do you do on weekends instead of drinking?
These are the two situations that cause me to drink and if I can hear some ideas I reckon it might help.
Cheers lads"
alcoholism,,"High functioning alcoholic One day when I get sober, Iâ€™ll write a book, or short story about how every liquor store in my neighborhood knows me. A version of me, the ugly version whoâ€™s thereâ€™s 3-4 times a day to buy 2 nips at a time cause I swear Iâ€™ll only drink 2 today. How I go into work and listen to all my co workers talk about one other woman we work with who always smells like alcohol and can never remember what sheâ€™s doing , as if Iâ€™ve never been in her shoes. How my husband thought I might be pregnant with our 2nd child cause for 3 days straight I drank too much and was so tired, hadnâ€™t he known about the excessive drinking. So we went and spent 12 on a pregnancy test when I knew the answer. How my brother, who is the black sheep of the family cause of his drinking problem , will feel knowing I suffered same as him but never let others know. One day."

alcoholism,,"How to help brother alcoholic Weâ€™re a Muslim family and alcohol is foreign to my parents and me tbh. The thing is heâ€™s not just an alcoholic heâ€™s a violent one. Had to call the cops on him once. We want him to quit and parents will never throw him out (heâ€™s in his late 20â€™s).

It was so foreign to us that we actually thought he had mental issues but he was actually just drunk the whole time, I do strongly suspect depression though. 

So how do we help him? We legitimately have no idea.  He gets black out drunk and then asks you the next day â€œwhat happenedâ€."

In fact, I desperately hope it does as soon as possible, all the time. But as for how it damages the people around me... so fucking depressing."

alcoholism,,"I keep hating myself but I'm done I don't know how I ended up so gripped by this addiction. I used to be so confident and proud to be me, now I just feel worthless due to my lack of self control. I haven't given quitting an honest try and I was partially in denial about the extent of my addiction but I really feel like it's time to get out from under the boot of addiction. If anybody out there is going through a tough day, just know I'm rooting for you and we can beat this thing."
alcoholism,,"How can I help my partner be a better ally for me and my recovery So iâ€™ve been out of the hospital for two weeks now. The plan I made with my doctor never included sobriety. And iâ€™ve been having good and bad days, but again, thatâ€™s part of the recovery plan I made with my doctor. We made some drinking guidelines for me to follow, and if i canâ€™t follow them perfectly every time thatâ€™s ok. As long as iâ€™m honest with my doctor. 

My partner however has been extremely controlling of my drinking. Giving me strict limits and getting angry when I donâ€™t respect them. He keeps saying things like â€œbut think about how I feelâ€ or â€œdo it for meâ€. He also keeps suggesting I take my anti-anxiety medication every time i get the impulse to drink. And this really angers me. I feel like every time i mess up, itâ€™s like I donâ€™t care about his feelings or love him enough. But my alcoholism is not about him, yet he still makes me feel guilty for hurting HIM when i mess up. 

Iâ€™m really starting to feel like he is doing more harm than good. I feel enough guilt regarding my drinking, I really donâ€™t need more. And when he tells me to take my medication, I feel like he is overstepping and not taking me seriously. Every time I tell him to stop, it goes back to me not caring about his feelings. I love him, but I am getting really tired of this. What can I do?"
alcoholism,,"Other (healthy) things that can relax me like alcohol? Since I've learned that I'm pregnant, I cut down every drop of alcohol to 0. Before that, I was kind of alcoholic. I needed the relief, the relaxation. I drank heavily about every weekend, and 1-2 beer every day. 

I have a very high level of anxiety. My body is always in tense, and so is my mind. Alcohol relieved that. 

I don't want to start drinking again when my baby is here. But I really miss the feeling of relief I had from time to time, the vacation from myself and tension. 

What didn't help: going to gym, swimming, yoga, pilates, dancing, sleeping, therapy,  medication. Do you have any more suggestions for an replacement, that is as relaxing as alcohol?"
alcoholism,,"Didn't know where else to ask: Did I experience symptoms of Alcohol deprivation? I've been drinking almost daily the past 3 weeks (Traveling, enjoying myself - usually don't drink more than 4-5 times a month, or sometimes go without for several months).

The drinks ranged from beer, to wine and also hard liquor. Went home to visit family and didn't drink for several days. 

I felt sick. Nausea, sometimes a feeling of weakness or almost pain in my joints, and fatigue as well as restlessness at the same time. 

I thought I'd caught a cold, so I drank a lot of tea, which usually helps. But it didn't help in this scenario. I continued to feel sick until last night when I had wine and some shots with friends. I was worried at first that it would make me more sick. But miraculously, I felt better. And even today, it's almost as if I never was ill.

I don't feel dependent on alcohol, I would know if I was addicted - I've been smoking for 7 years. I will also be volunteering on a sailboat in Norway for 2 months, cleaning up plastic trash and nets from the sea and coastline; so there will not be much drinking anyway, good for me.

Anyway, I'm not too concerned about alcoholism per se, I was just wondering if I was truly suffering from withrawal symptoms. That would be a first for me.

Thanks guys!"

how long do withdrawal symptoms usually last? im not talking about what doctors tell you and how long ""detox"" they give you, to basically make sure you dont die.   


but for people who have been through it, how long until your symptoms of withdrawal were gone?   


im a former Benzo dependent.... and these things were HELL to get off and the symptoms destroyed me. they lasted YEARS. but ive heard alcohol withdrawal isnt anywhere as long as Benzo withdrawal. if they were, id honestly want my dad to keep drinking, i dont think itd be worth it for him to go through that absolute hell for such a long time. and he'd be unfunctional.   


so how long does it last?"

alcoholism,,"Please be careful It was recommended that I share my story here.

I have a friend of 17 years, and he's been living with me as a roommate for the last eight years. I rely heavily on him for moral support because there are times in life when it gets hard and I get depressed. I had texted him a couple times and he didn't respond. Last Tuesday I went downstairs to check on him and he said that he was barely able to get to the bathroom and he was stuck in bed. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he just felt sick. About 2 hours later I went downstairs again to make sure that he was okay and he said he figured out what was wrong with him. He said that the symptoms he was having coincide with alcohol withdrawal. So I learned that he stopped drinking on Saturday prior to the Tuesday when I spoke with him. On Wednesday I went downstairs and checked on him, and he was sleeping so I figured I would let him do so. On Thursday he asked for some sugar, and some salt for gargling and something sweet to drink. That night I spoke with one of my other roommates and he told me that Amy Winehouse died from alcohol withdrawal and we should keep an eye on him. Yesterday while I was at work I asked my roommate to go check on him and he said that my friend was non-responsive but he thought my buddy was asleep. When I got home from work at 5:20 p.m. I went downstairs and looked in the room and he looked like he was dead. I looked at his chest to see if it was raising and lowering but it wasn't. I called 911 and after the first responders came I found out he was dead. I've never discovered a dead body before and right now I'm feeling angry and sad. The ultimate irony of all of this is that the thing that killed him is the thing that would have kept him alive. The coroner said that he had multiple organ failure and she had been dead for about 16 hours. I don't know where to put any of this. As an intj I pretty much have rationalized it to the point where I believe he's in a better place because his life was rather difficult and tragic but there is a part of me that feels callous and cold for not being emotional enough."

Iâ€™m so fucking broken. To the love of my life, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m so fucked. You deserve better than me. Truly. And FUCK I just want to quit but I keep saying one more day and Iâ€™ll quit tomorrow.

alcoholism,,"Just told my mum I won't put up with her functional alcoholism So, long story short, my mum has been drinking since I remember. It's functional, she goes to work and does her chores. But her drinking problem has been an ongoing issue and the root of my trauma. It got to the point when I refrain from calling her in the afternoons/evenings because she's always tipsy/drunk or doesn't pick up because she knows I'll immediately know and point it out.

Today, I plucked up the courage and told her that I ask her not to be in touch with me in any form when she's drunk. I told her I love her, I'm incredibly sorry that she's unhappy to which she responded that I can't help her unless she helps herself which she can't do at the moment. 

Therapy is not really an option because of many factors that I don't want to get into. 

I'm heartbroken but I can't let myself participate in this normalization of her problem. It's been like that my whole life and now that I'm 22, I can't let it affect me anymore, I'm just incredibly sick of it. 

I know it may sound like I'm cold and selfish, but I'm just trying to stay afloat myself. As she said, there's nothing I can do. I struggle with my mental health as well and it only adds up to the pile of issues I deal with every day. Obviously, I do want to be around and check up on her but I don't feel strong enough to be around when alcohol is on the table.

I have mixed feelings about it all but I'm trying to stay on top of it. Any tips from you guys on how to deal with all those feelings?"

alcoholism,,"Going to talk to my husband tomorrow He's 32. Adding new drinking stories under his belt is no longer cute nor is it welcome. We were supposed to do a sober March, which was no big deal to me but I should have seen the writing on the wall when he made excuses for not making it through the week.

Our friends got married today and he got so drunk he was falling over in bushes, shoved me when I tried to offer him water, and had the groom worried enough that he left his own wedding to help my husband (one of his groomsman). I had to get several wedding guests to help me guide him to the Uber. My husband is currently staying at an Airbnb with some of his friends. I only left to take care of our dog.

My husband has recently (as in within the past two years) developed his social identity around collecting beer. We literally have multiple fridges dedicated to the rare beers he's ""aging"" but I hate them all. He's admitted to blowing thousands of dollars on beer every year but refuses to stop."

Anyways, Iâ€™ve recently transferred from a local junior college to a university and Iâ€™ve run into an issue. Whenever Iâ€™m bored and alone with alcohol around the house (mine or something I can discreetly steal from my roomate), I cant stop myself from indulging. Whenever I have access to booze and I am bored or lonely I drink. I recognize that this is probably not the greatest sign, but having just transferred to my current university, I have no real close friends I have found myself drinking alone plenty of times (tonight includes) and on some level I recognize how dangerous that path can be, having had a couple of family members i grew up with end up in AA. How do I manage having fun and becoming a risk to myself and others?"

Bloating, muscle weakness, depression, nosebleeds, slow healing and I think itâ€™s making my hair thin. I woke up last weekend after a particularly heavy binge, I puked my guts out and then laid there with my heart feeling like it was going to explode with every beat. I didnâ€™t get up to go wash my mouth out and I still have red marks around my lips from the stomach acid.

Iâ€™m coming up on 28 now and I want to be healthy in my 30â€™s. Itâ€™s like I hardly remember what itâ€™s like to be me anymore. I was a happy kid/teenager but now I just feel worthless and I drown that worthless feeling with more booze and I try and justify it in my own mind. Itâ€™s fucking cancer and I know it deep down. Probably the worst part of all, Iâ€™ve never told anyone about this until now.

Iâ€™m tired of waking up feeling like shit. Iâ€™m tired of passing out until 1am in my living room instead of going to bed like a normal person. Iâ€™m tired of feeling so drained. Iâ€™m tired of checking my eyes in the morning for jaundice. Iâ€™m tired of not giving my dog a proper long walk. Iâ€™m tired of not hanging out with my friends. Iâ€™m tired of disappointing myself every time I tell myself Iâ€™m going to stop at one and end up having 5.

I used to never drink on weeknights, besides the occasional glass of wine before an exam in college. Fast forward a year and I wan to drink every night when I leave work. I work second shift so itâ€™s easy to feel down when I have no one to talk to when I get off.

alcoholism,,"I used to drink socially, now I drink emotionally I feel like I am starting to show alcoholic tendencies.... it runs in my family. I have always been aware of this and never really saw my personal drinking as an issue before... I drank socially and had fun and knew when the fun was over. 
Now... I feel like I drink to numb my pain... or to help my lack of satisfaction in life. I recently started depression meds and was informed to be careful when mixing because of the side effects.. but that one or two drinks would be okay. 

My main reason I tend to over do it is because my marriage isnâ€™t going so great at the moment. Nothing truly significant has happened itâ€™s just... flat. 
Husband isnâ€™t very attentive to me. So when we actually hangout I mostly drink too much because I am happy we are hanging and donâ€™t want the attention to stop... and I end up doing stupid stuff like spending WAY too much money going out.. trying to figure out what we can do next cause I would rather stay out and be in debt than go home and have him ignore me because of his video games... itâ€™s not a healthy habit (for me or my wallet) 
Does anyone else relate? 
I have OCD and can struggle with the all or nothing. I wake up and say no more!! But then become depressed or stressed and want a glass of wine. 
I struggle with hangxiety as I write this...
I want to re find my healthy balance of social drinking rather than emotional... or should I take a break...?  I wake up and say I will do better and then end up doing it all over again.... 

any thoughts or tips are welcome. Donâ€™t be too mean, I am hangxious at the moment :)"
alcoholism,,"Best Friend Cant/Wont Quit My best friend has had a drinking problem for 7 years. Every day from when he wakes up until he passes back out again, he's drinking. He's even broken into my apartment once to sleep.    

Recently, he's gotten a new girlfriend and new apartment. We thought he was drinking less, but she approached us saying it's out of control. He's spiraling and needs help. Ok, nbd. We're here to help. We all meet with him and basically have a baby intervention. ""Dude you have a problem, we know, we wanna help.""    

And we thought it was getting under control. He's seeing a doctor, he's picking up new hobbies, we're hanging out sober having fun.    

Again, not what's happening. He leaves early ""for work"" and goes to a bar for pre work shots. I have coworkers telling me he has a stash of booze in the basement, and he's getting fucked up at work. We work in a restaurant. Whenever our boss, or his wife, comes back they keep feeding him shots. He never turns them down. In all the years of being over 21, I've never seen him turn down free booze.    

So at this point, I'm personally at a loss. I've had mutual friends tell me this is why they no longer talk/hang out. People dont wanna be around him when he's drinking. I don't wanna be around him anymore, and we've been inseparable for 13 years."

He has said multiple times that he canâ€™t deal with seeing me drunk but one beer or whatever is fine. Iâ€™m not a big drinker so it hasnâ€™t come up often however recently I did accept a beer from somebody in front of him and long story short he had a strong reaction and we ended up having a horrible fight. I never want him to feel like that again and Iâ€™ve concluded that despite what he says, I need to never drink around him or anytime when heâ€™ll smell it on me, which I am 100% okay with. Itâ€™s an adjustment Iâ€™m happy to make because I love him. He is so worried that if I make this promise, Iâ€™ll end up resenting him for it. I think he doesnâ€™t fully believe that for me, being with him is beyond worth it. I know that addiction affects psychology beyond consuming the actual substance so Iâ€™m looking for some insight from people who have been through it. Thanks!"

alcoholism,,"Permanent damage from blacking out so much? So I'll sum it up quick here. I don't drink alone and I don't drink every day, but I like to binge on the weekends with my friends. I've blacked out at least 50+ times, possibly even hundreds of times while binging (within the past 6 years or so, ages 23-29 roughly).

alcoholism,,"My boyfriend went to his first AA meeting while weâ€™ve been together and seems to be in a really good place. What are the best ways to be supportive? What do I say to my boyfriend about him going back to AA? Iâ€™m not sure what is supportive or is nice to hear.

My boyfriend was out this morning and when I looked at his calendar (I help with his real estate business), I saw that he had an AA meeting for noon that he put in the night before. I was surprised because I knew he used to go but then decided that he didnâ€™t really feel like an alcoholic and honestly I havenâ€™t noticed any problems, especially since we spend most of the week sober. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m very proud that he reflected on things and decided to take action on something he saw as an issue.

He got home while I was cooking lunch and showed me his 24 hour chip after a few minutes of talking about my morning. I hugged him and kissed his cheek and said I was proud of him. I also asked later what made him want to go. He said he just hates how he spends at least half of his nights a week getting drunk and not remembering what he did, then struggling to get up in the morning and losing half of the next day. He told me he wants to be able to take care of me and his family.

Iâ€™m a bit confused because I genuinely didnâ€™t see an issue. He did see one and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s important. I have no problem with his newfound (refound?) sobriety and honestly am just really proud that he has the personal insight and honesty to go to a meeting after being away for so long. 

However, my only real interaction with these types of groups are with my brother who very begrudgingly went to NA for a few months after my parents put him in a rehab program and then once he was financially independent, stopped going to meetings. What did you wish your loved ones told you? Is saying Iâ€™m proud patronizing? How can I best support him? Can I ask my boyfriend questions about why he felt like things were out of control or is that too prying? What would be good to ask? And what were you thinking when you told someone you went to a meeting for the first time?

I hope my surprise didnâ€™t come off as apathy, I just wanted to think about what to tell him before I did. This man is the love of my life and I want to be as supportive as possible."

alcoholism,,"Iâ€™m currently in the hospital watching my mom die from this terrible disease. Everyone talks about the dangers of drug addiction. How terrible it is to OD. How many people theyâ€™ve seen go out that way. Let me tell you right now, the death from alcoholic cirrhosis is absolutely torture. Iâ€™ve been in the hospital watching my mother steadily decline for 5 days now. Sheâ€™s been in a coma since Thursday. She can no longer swallow so saliva, bile and sputum from her lungs are building up in her throat and the sound of her trying to breath through all that is something Iâ€™ll remember until the day I die. 

And the worst part of all is that my grandma is alive to witness this. My moms brother was an alcoholic too and died pretty much this exact way almost 3 years ago. This will be two children sheâ€™s buried because of this disease. 

I know that there is nothing anyone can do or say to make you quit. That is has to be a decision you make yourself. But I just hope that maybe someone will see this and itâ€™ll be a wake up call. Please spare your family this torture."
alcoholism,,"My moms a mentally ill alcoholic Like the title says my moms demons have gotten very bad since Iâ€™ve moved home from college. Maybe itâ€™s the fact sheâ€™s been alone in her thoughts for the past 4 years. She usually starts drinking around 3pm or 4pm and it ends with her passed out mouth wide open with the TV on at about 9pm give or take. She also had borderline personality disorder and an autoimmune disease, so the big thing is once sheâ€™s hit a certain amount of drinks she gets kinda manic and if you donâ€™t agree with every single thing she says you become public enemy number 1 and sheâ€™s gonna let you know how big of a piece of shit you are, she also doesnâ€™t listen to what youâ€™re saying and then get pissed when you mention to her itâ€™s your 3rd time saying it. She also just watches the news and allows herself to get more and more frightened. Now sheâ€™s thinks sheâ€™s Frankie from Grace and Frankie because in her mind acting all drunk and loopy is just being a spacey hippie. And the worst part is when she wakes up, she has no idea any of this happened. A big thing Iâ€™ve noticed is sheâ€™ll move or break things while intoxicated and wake up the next day and ask my why I did it. (Doesnâ€™t remember anything, last night she barged into my bathroom 3 times cause she couldnâ€™t remember I was taking a shower). Anyway Iâ€™ve kinda given up on helping her after being back for a year and a half and Iâ€™m moving outta state for a job finally, Iâ€™m thinking this is it I donâ€™t want anything to do with her and get fantasy world anymore"
alcoholism,,"N/A beer worth it? When trying to quit or cut back has anyone tried N/A beer? I really like the taste of beer so, does it taste the same? Help with cravings at all? Iâ€™m having a stressful day and already thinking I want beer when I know I just canâ€™t right now. Enough is enough. Wondering if itâ€™s worth the buy..."
alcoholism,,I did it again I fucked up again I went sober for three months as soon as I thought I could handle it I drank again I embarrassed myself I wasted a ton of money at a strip club I donâ€™t even remember I sideswiped a car and my wife didnâ€™t drop off my daughter Saturday as planned because I was passed out drunk when she came in the morning. Now Iâ€™m heading into work withCuts on my forehead a car thatâ€™s dented and an over whelming feeling of guilt why do I do this to myself
alcoholism,,"I fucking hate it but I want it I can't stand the fact the I willingly ingest poison. I want it, and at the same time, I hate that I want it. I hate the taste but love the feeling. Hate the aftermath yet seek the cause. Suffer consequences from it, yet repeat the mistake. Break promises I've made to myself because I've tried to rationalize moderation when I know, good and well, that I can not successfully moderate. I fucking hate it and I hate that I want it."
alcoholism,,"What to expect going cold turkey? All advice is much appreciated Hello, fellow perseveres,

I have been self-medicating for PTSD, Panic disorder, Depression, OCD and ADHD for the past \~4 years. 

I guess I would fall into the category of ""functional substance abuser"" as I have been able to hold down a job and not let it affect my personal relationships too much. I developed Panic Disorder over a decade ago and have been on 5 mg diazepam/valium ever since. While it was not optimal, it allowed me to build a career and exit the house. Though sometime in early 2016 a myriad of unfortunate events culminated to the point where my mind ran amuck and I chose to deal with this by not dealing with it. I.E. substances.

For the past 4 years, my ""self-help regimen"" has consisted of 15-20mg valium, 10-20 cigarettes and between 5-8 beers (or equivalent in whiskey or wine) a day. While I never get inebriated to the point where I'm unconscious or puking, on the worst days I make stupid choices and suffer the consequences with a severe hangover the day after. Furthermore, I have recognized my cognitive abilities decline significantly in the last 1.5 years. My memory is so bad I almost forgot the word memory right now and the brain fog has become so thick that it's hard to articulate myself in conversations. In addition, my libido is non-existent, my angst is as bad as ever and my depression has consumed my life: If I don't feel the onset of a panic attack, I am simply numb throughout the day, to which my response is to drink. Drinking makes me feel **something.**

I woke up at 4 am tonight dehydrated from last night's alcohol and simply felt deep inside of me that I have had enough. This is not the first time I have told myself those words, but I am ready to try. I won't quit the benzos overnight due to the obvious dangers with that but would love any sort of feedback from people who may have worn similar shoes sometime in their life. Will quitting the aforementioned alcohol dosage cold turkey after 4 years pose a risk in terms of seizures? I am also curious as to whether I can expect to see my cognition improve at a recognizable pace (trying to find motivators to keep me straight), or is it more likely that I will get a lot worse before I get better?"
alcoholism,,Is there anyway we could start a chat in this group? So thouse who need to chat with one of us can to when we need to reach out
alcoholism,,"Super scared Tomorrow, I'll go in for a detox at a hospital.  


The local one, about 30 minutes from here, doesn't have the competence to deal with this stuff, so they'll most likely send me to another hospital, about 2-3 hours away.  


Lately, in maybe the last two months, I've just been sitting or laying in my bed, and sipping wine, to fend off withdrawals. I feel so fatigued - maybe because of thiamine deficiency, plus that I've barely eaten. Maybe half a meal a day.  


Detox is absolute hell... 5-6 days of agony, as I know from experience... (too many times)  


(I'm aware this might break rule #1 of this sub, but I don't feel intoxicated at all, but the opposite, extreme anticipation anxiety - I try not to drink so much, but it's extremely hard to do this on your own)  


I'm sick of this, and it's not getting any better. I have postponed reaching for help way too long. This is the worst I've ever felt, and it is a powerful lesson in why I shouldn't drink."
alcoholism,,Sugar cravings through the roof Since Iâ€™ve quit drinking (2 months) my sugar cravings are out today of control and Iâ€™m cranky and irritable until I have some... minor problem compared to drinking but any advice?
alcoholism,,"Panic attacks at 1 month sober? My husband has about a month sober (I think).  Heâ€™s been SO anxious.  Says heâ€™s scared heâ€™ll get the shakes, or have a seizure.   

I told him that at 1 month sober - thatâ€™s just irrational.  He gets it, but is still super scared.  He took an Ativan tonight and it helped.  But he was still so freaked out.  

Heâ€™s been mostly ok - just SUPER FATIGUED, and a bit emotionally erratic.  

I have no idea whatâ€™s normal, or common.  Any thoughts?"
alcoholism,,"Does anyone else feel isolated and in a box. Yes. I have had my battles with booze.  All the different kinds of it. Beer Liquor Wine and now seltzerâ€™s.  I checked myself into rehab a year ago. Came out better and happier. 

I have not been perfect and I have admitted it to my spouse and others my fallings and have up until a few months ago really made an attempt to go to meetings as well. Iâ€™m just exhausted of all of it. 

I donâ€™t drink anything near the amount I used too anymore and  even if I have a few and I feel like Iâ€™m always under a microscope . Maybe thatâ€™s me interpreting others thoughts. 

When I admit that I have had anything my wife just says ....whyyyyyy?  I donâ€™t fucking know. I just tell her itâ€™s a work in progress and harder then she gets. I can tell she really has no idea what itâ€™s like though. 

Recently Iâ€™ve just gotten very tired of people who think they know what this addiction is like. They donâ€™t. 

All I feel is pissed off when people say someone is an alcoholic and they have zero fucking insight into that person. Is some one who smokes to much a cigarettaholic??  Is some one who eats too much a foodaholic??  Should they NEVER eat again?? Is someone who hoards stuff a hoardaholic???  Is someone who collects valuable cars a caraholic??   

I do my best not to judge others who struggle. I just wish others would try to be more open and understanding of those of us who do, instead of labeling faults of others instead of always assuming we just suck and are weak. 

Thoughts"
alcoholism,,"I believe my drink was spiked I went to a bar last week with my friend and remember when I came home because I went to bed.  The next day I woke up with severe disorientation and confusion that I thought was just a bad hang over.  Its been exactly a week now and I still feel disoriented.  I can barely even concentrate long enough to type this up.  I don't think my drink was spiked with drugs because my friend was with my the whole time and was watching our drinks and nobody came up to us.  I believe there was methanol in the shots or something because I don't remember hallucinating or have the side effects of the date rape drugs, just trouble concentrating like I have alcohol poisoning. How long will these effects last and when should I see a doctor if the symptoms dont disappear?"
alcoholism,,"Locked out of room and its my fault. I'm sober. Im not sure if thats the term to use. But i do no drink, not even a sip. I learned early on what that did to me and know I'm not a good person when I drink. My partner however, drinks every chance she can. On a day off of work, on a day of work. I know its unhealthy and ive tried my share of being understanding, being strict. Nothing works and today is to the point, i dont think I can handle one more day.

I get off work M-F at 5pm every week. Its always the same. I don't have a car due to some money issues and my partner always makes sure i get a ride home. 5:20 comes around. No ride, no call, no text. So i find a ride home. 
Get home and the chain is on the door and its the ONLY way into my apartmenr since im on the third floor. I called and text over 20 times no response. 
Decide ill walk get some food come back. I go eat and walk back. Time is now 7pm. 
So i get my landlord involved. I didnt want to but i cannot get inside my own house. When my landlords bangs on the door, lo and behold my partner finally wakes up.

I get cussed out about how im the asshole who woke her up since shes gotta work tonight and she has beer cans all over the floor.

I'm just crying like a baby because nothing i say even matters at this point."
alcoholism,,Iâ€™m supposed to go to a meeting tonight. Iâ€™ve already fucked up.  I want so badly to be better.
alcoholism,,"Do I have a problem with alcohol? So Iâ€™ve been worried for a while now that I might be addicted to alcohol. The issue is I donâ€™t really see it as a â€œproblem.â€ Other than worrying about long term health concerns, I donâ€™t notice any effects of my daily life. I get up every day and do well at my job, Iâ€™m there for my wife and family, I am social, I keep up with things around the house, etc. Basically I am living the life I want to, but I rarely go a day without a drink. Most of the time itâ€™s a few beers after work, sometimes itâ€™s several glasses of wine or bourbon, but I never lose control. Iâ€™m not aggressive or confrontational. I just drink. I havenâ€™t gone more than 4-5 days without a drink in probably 10 years. 

I think I should stop because that canâ€™t be good for me, but I really donâ€™t want to. Iâ€™ve been telling myself Iâ€™m not an alcoholic because I am fully functioning and honestly my life is going great. But Iâ€™m honestly not sure if I could give up alcohol today if I needed to. 

Can anyone give me advice? Am I killing myself? Where do I go from here?"
alcoholism,,"Came home to significant other in withdrawal the tl;dr: Firstly, not seeking specific medical advice, seeking advice on handling situation at home. Aka, where do I draw a line or take a stand, how do I be supportive without being destructive. 

How we got here: Their drinking previously had worsened to on the order of a 2-3 half gallons of vodka per week, maybe more, over the last 2 months. For the previous 8+ months before that, ikt was more like 1 half gallon per week. Now they are very ill, sweaty, unable to eat or sleep.

Details: I recently returned from being on a work trip. Significant other is in substantial withdrawal symptoms and I am having a hard time handling/supporting it.  The first couple nights they claimed they were â€œtaperingâ€ but ended up so drunk they fell/couldnâ€™t walk. They were taking shots of vodka essentially 24 hrs a day â€œbecause they need themâ€ and â€œcanâ€™t stop cold turkeyâ€ - I estimate near a pint of vodka yesterday and probably nearly a quart in the previous days. I understand completely stopping suddenly is dangerous, but I donâ€™t know how to actually convince them they arenâ€™t drinking less and that they need to.

As of last night, I got rid of \*most\* of the alcohol in the house and took them to a free clinic - they have no insurance. By good/terrible luck, the clinic confirmed alcohol withdrawals and prescribed them a small number of low dose alprazolam (12 @ 0.5mg). They are a larger person \~230lbs. They claim the doctors literally said â€œtake these and taperâ€ with no specific schedule or further advice, which I donâ€™t buy.  

Today is the first day they had the prescription filled, and the first day theyâ€™ve gone 12 hours w/o a drink (afaik). Some symptoms are very obviously real(sweaty, red face, unable to eat) some I canâ€™t tell if theyâ€™re exaggerated (seeing/hearing things). They immediately took 3 of the 12 alprazolam and are still asking for alcohol saying theyâ€™re going to die from seizures.  Iâ€™m providing lots of water and trying to get them to sleep without giving more alcohol just yet (again, itâ€™s only been roughly 12 hours since their last 2 drinks). 

Advice on handling this in general is much appreciated. Iâ€™ve read everything I can and will continue reading on this sub for stories that will help. Thanks in advance."
alcoholism,,more of a habit than a necessity In my case it seems more of a habit to me where I most alway get buzzed every night.  I get the feeling if I will be missing something if I don't have a drink.  If I can structure the evening so I only have a single drink then I'm fine with that.  Also when I get a buzz on I like to work out on piano and do a couple hits of weed.   Then I binge eat.  I find the buzzed state a place of expanded insight into life and my personality-which to me is a good thing. Something I would not otherwise experience.   It's just the cumulative effect of overeating and over drinking that I fight against.  It disrupts the following day because of lessened energy.
alcoholism,,"I drank vodka religiously from age 19 to 24. I drank vodka heavily if not daily from the ages 19 to 24. It was my coping mechanism for every emotion I had. Time to celebrate? Vodka. Bad day at work? Vodka. I didn't go out without getting drunk first. I didn't see my group of friends or my high school sweetheart without being drunk. I had become irritable, euphoric, estatic, reckless, suicidal; mixed emotions every day, almost manic.

I began taking antidepressants on the 2nd year out of 5 of my alcohol era. Its crazy how I avoided the real problem and had tried everything else in every direction to feel better back then. I had lost my loving high school sweetheart, dropped out of college, and lost good friends through my own reckless behavior. Medication and alcohol is a dangerous combination.

I was so neurotic, anxious, and unhappy all that time but hid It well. It had just got so much worse near the end when my comfort zone at work had been disrupted. I had quit my job Oct 2019. My first thought walking out was being worried about all my free time. If I didn't stop drinking and deal with this now I will die.

It was one of the hardest things I had ever done. Mind you, before all of this I had quit smokin, quit a meth addiction, and worked 70 hour weeks of physical labor... underweight. Those were all a piece of cake before this.

I had terrible insomnia. I would not sleep for days at a time since I had quit last year. I had fits of rage that whole month of Nov. The drop of a pen would set me off. I was sweating almost constantly. I was crying so much. I see things out of the corners of my eyes. Still do. Instant confusion. Can't remember what I had done one minute to the next. Talking sober is hard. This wave passes, but the psychosis aspect is still effecting me.

This is the first time I had truly felt like myself in a long time. 5 years. It's a breath of fresh air. I draw again. I play video games, cook, and study spanish. I remember time spent with my fiance. Going back to college next year. I scrambled my brain but it's healing.

I look so drained now. I guess from the stress of It all. I'm only 24 but typing all that out it was a living hell OMG. Wasted my early 20's in misery and loneliness. Wish I had got help sooner. I'll always be an alcoholic. That's why I don't drink now. Much love. â¤"
alcoholism,,"At what age did you realize your drinking was a legitimate problem? Most people (or I guess maybe it just seems that way) start drinking fairly early and it usually escalates in college but never becomes an actual problem for them. I've just recently started college and was having  some problems and went to my college's referral center and ended up being referred off campus for substance abuse disorder because the school says there's nothing they can provide. I only have my parents insurance and there's no way I can do anything through that. And paying out of pocket is a no go too. I've been to a couple of AA meetings in the area but they didn't really seem to help. I'm just worried and don't want anything to escalate until a point of no return. Has anyone else had similar experiences? And if so, what did you do?"
alcoholism,,"Advice wanted for staging an intervention Cross-posted to r/mentalillness

Long story short, my dad is an alcoholic. Tale as old as time, right? He has been since I was a kid. The way he got on the wagon was when I was 10, my mom took me and threatened to leave him. When she killed herself, he started drinking again. When my brother was murdered, he started drinking more. 

He is drunk nearly everyday. He yells and screams and breaks things. He threatens to hurt people. We have had interventions (once with his therapist that has since moved and he hasn't gone to see another one). He admits he has a problem and promises to get help but then he keeps drinking.

My therapist told me to go no contact. I did that with my mom (emotional abuse) and she died. I did that with my brother (emotional abuse, threatening to kill me) and he died. I don't want to leave my dad but I can't keep listening to him when he keeps saying he will get help and he doesn't. He lives as my grandma's caretaker; she is in the hospital right now for a broken hip. I help when I can but he needs to take the first step to getting treatment.

I called SAMSA and a couple of other hotlines so here is my game plan which I am going to outline to my dad tomorrow.
1. I'm not taking him to any store anymore. He does this thing where he will ask me to take him to get medicine or food, and then he will buy alcohol. 
2. When he yells and screams and breaks things, when he threatens violence and emotionally abuses people, I am going to call the nonemergency line for the cops in order to make documentation of the problem. He doesn't get to get away with threatening people and scaring them any more. If they put him in the county drunk tank, then that's his business. 
3. I am going to see about hiring a professional interventionist. They run about 3000-8000 dollars but surely I can find one with a payment plan. 
4. If he escalates and I become afraid he will hurt himself or others and not just talk, I am going to petition to have him forcibly committed. 

Like I've talked and begged and pleaded and cried and I'm done. He tells me he'll get help and then he doesn't. I know it's a disease and I know he is struggling but he has always been firm when it came to me getting the mental help I needed. The biggest fight he ever had with my mom was putting me in therapy. He might hate me for this but I can't trust him when he says he will get help. 

I'm almost in tears so I guess if you have any advice I'd appreciate it"
alcoholism,,"Functioning Alcoholic Iâ€™m a highly functioning alcoholic. On most days I am binging after work but there are days where I can abstain drinking completely. On those days, I feel like I have it under control only to realize that I donâ€™t the next day. I feel guilty about not having a severe case of alcoholism, but at the same time when I do drink, itâ€™s out of control and I cannot limit what Iâ€™m taking in. Iâ€™ve had a problem since 2012. I also have a three month old baby who I feel like is being affected by this. My husband doesnâ€™t drink really at all and has no idea about the severity. 

Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else has had this type of experience? My best friend is a recovering alcoholic and sheâ€™s four years sober. Iâ€™ve been to AA meetings with her but have excused it as just being there to support her. I feel like I would be super shamed for going to AA and I almost feel too good for it as fucked up as that sounds.

I donâ€™t know where to go from here. I feel like Iâ€™m ruining my marriage and failing my newborn child. I dunno, I guess Iâ€™m just looking for advice or how to cope with being a functioning alcoholic. Anyone relate to this? My first time posting. I feel dumb but hoping maybe I can connect and get some encouragement."
alcoholism,,"Started drinking I turned 21 about two months ago. What used be be 1-2 beers a week turned into two beers a day, everyday. 

I just heard alcoholism is hereditary. My grandfather and dad were former alcoholics, and my great-grandfather died from alcoholism (liver cancer). 

Should I be concerned? Should I be thinking about cutting back?"
alcoholism,,"Dating an alcoholic who's in jail for DUI I've been dating a wonderful guy for 5 years who was arrested Friday night for DUI. Had an empty container of vodka in his car and refused a breathalyzer. Apparently he was wasted. His brother bailed him out. It was his third DUI. Which is a felony in our state. And unfortunately his last DUI had yet to go to court. I'm in a state of shock, his family is in a state of shock and we are trying our best to figure out how to help him, etc. He hid his drinking from all of us. I only see him once a week, every weekend, and he barely touches a glass of wine. I recently found out about DUIs 1 &amp; 2 I had told him that I could not be in a relationship with him until he admitted his problem and got help. That conversation happened last Saturday and a week later he had another DUI. He is still not admitting he has a problem. He called me tonight from jail, first time we have spoken, and I told him please not to call me and to focus on himself and his family and figuring out how the hell he was going to deal with all of this. This is a deal breaker for me but I'm feeling tremendously guilty. Maybe I was too harsh? Our relationship was already strained and almost dead, he knew and I had given him an ultimatum. I will support him from behind the scenes, supporting the efforts of his family. I want to help him but maybe I'm doing it all wrong by being tough on him. I don't know."
alcoholism,,"Is my drinking becoming a problem? Today my girlfriend and I broke up. She was shaken, and the people we were with the Friday before were also disturbed, by my behavior.

Friday, I went out for some drinks with friends from the office at 6:30, and my SO and I planned to meet with a different group of friends after. My office friends and I each had 4 drinks over the course of 3 hours. I thought it wasn't too overboard. I moved to the UK from the US two years ago, and there drinking culture is a bit heavier, so I thought of that amount of alcohol over that amount of time was fairly normal for a Friday night. By the time I was about to head over to my SO and our friend group at about 10, I was fairly tipsy. I admit, very energetic and loud. 

Generally, while sober, I am usually a very energetic, enthusiastic person. I talk with my hands, I can be sort of loud (my Americaness showing), and I like to crack jokes and make people laugh. 

Those drinks previously were from a craft brewery, so the ABV levels must've been higher, because apparently I went overboard that night. 

My SO was relating my behavior back to me today, and it was really bad. I was all over the place, in people's faces, 0-100 depressed to uncannily happy, making everyone around me very uncomfortable. Keep in mind, they just started their night. 

The worst part was my SO telling me that--while I didn't seem to mean to--I would clap her on the back when she was sitting beside me in a way that I saw as comraderey at the time, but was too drunk to realize it was very hard and actually left a mark later. I physically hurt her by accident, and she told me today that not only was she scared for me--alcohol poisoning, lack of self-respect, etc.--but she was also scared . . . . of me. I was unpredictable, sporadic, crazy. Not malicious or mean. Just out of control. And capable of harm.

She told me to go sleep at my own place that Friday, so I got a kebab and crashed in my bed. That night, I was drunk enough that I didn't sense any discomfort on her part or on anyone else's. But after I left, they all started talking, ""wow he is wasted very early. I hope he's okay. That was all very uncomfortable."" 

The next day, I got a long text from her about it and my heart sunk. We didn't talk about it until Monday, today. She said she didn't know how to cope with me acting like that. It disturbed her. Despite her describing how I was, I'm scared to actually see what I was like, observing myself that night from a table over. 

Anyway. I have not touched any alcohol for three days. I think my alcohol habits are fairly reasonable. I used to be the guy who would be most drunk at a get together, but I feel like I've matured over the past couple years. I don't usually drink more than 2 times a week these days. I never drink alone, always with other people, and try to make sure I don't drink more than the people around me. 

I don't know what to do though concerning alcohol. I'm ashamed. Is this just a relapse? Should I cut it out completely? If try to be more moderate, how do I know I won't have another horrible night like this? I feel like I can live without alcohol, but it seems like the social thing to do where I live."
alcoholism,,"Looking for support I've been staring at my phone trying to figure out what to say.  I know I need help and have seen how supportive everyone is on this subreddit.  I've lost jobs and been extremely unreliable to the people I care about.  Addiction runs in my family and has caused recent tragedy in our lives, and because of that I'm afraid to admit it and ask for help.  I feel like this is the first time I've been able to be honest.

alcoholism,,"Struggling, bad. A couple weeks ago, I fell, hard, off the wagon and had a drink.  Well, a lot of them.

I had a small detox period and was doing great again, but my mother was just admitted to hospital with a severe infection coming from a tiny little cut on her right index finger.  It's spread, very quickly through her hand and into her arm, and they fear there might be sepsis, in her blood.  She isn't doing well now, and I can't be there with her, because where I work, I'm exposed to all kinds of possible infectious things, and she is on isolation atm.

So I'm sitting here, at home, freaking out.  She was already not well, COPD, CHF, renal insufficiency, and HTN.  So this could be bad, in a big way.  The call to run to the store and grab a metric fuck-ton of alcohol, and drink till I pass out is loud, and I don't know how much longer I can resist.

I know it won't help me, or even more, won't help her, but I don't know how else to stop myself from overthinking it and freaking out.

Any ideas, please?"
alcoholism,,"My husband decided he wants to go to rehab - I could use some advise on a few things from those who have gone and those who have supported their loved ones while they are there. The drinking has been going on for a couple of years now and has gotten progressively worse. We have talked about rehab here and there for the past year and he really started to express interest this past month. After some heart to hearts, bad nights, repercussions of actions, the physical affects getting worse and worse, and all that stress catching up to him, he decided he's ready and asked me to find somewhere and get him in. 

He was really sick from it yesterday but he had some beers in the evening. Last night was the worst I've ever seen him. I was up with him most of the night because he needed support. He was anxious, hyper ventilating, talking about all sorts of topics, overthinking, he said he felt pressure in his head and his eyes were killing him, etc. This morning I found him a facility that accepts our insurance and got him all setup. He's been in bed all day and is really hurting. He asked the counselor if he could go on Friday. 

Here's my current dilemma: The rehab called back and said they can't take him until Sunday morning but he could go to a detox center for a week and then get transferred there. I haven't mentioned this to him yet since he is resting but does anyone have any suggestions based on experience what would be better? Should we just wait and have him go on Sunday? Or should we get him to the detox on Friday and have him transferred the following week? I've seen him sick before but never like this and I am fearful of what could happen in the next 2-4 days. 

I'm open to all suggestions and/or advise on how I can best support him until he goes and during and after treatment. What is my role in this process? What worked for you and your spouse/loved one? Thank you in advance!"
alcoholism,,"Coming to terms Hello, first time poster, long time lurker on separate account. I recently went on a bender, and it woke me up that I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It was a four day bender, and I know I drank about a fifth a day. The reason I've never posted and just joined the sub was a mental block, like it's finally admitting I can't or shouldn't drink. I've made progress, having finally admit it to close people in my life, and have been sober for a couple days now. The next issue however, is that I'm pretty sure I'm going through withdrawals now. I've had withdrawal once or twice before, and I waited it out, but this one has me scared, as does the idea of going to the doctor to make sure this isn't my end. I know it's for the best, but it's scary to admit these things and that I could be going to the doctor and it's just a mild withdrawal or that I've nearly killed myself. Any words of comfort that helped you seek treatment and walk into the hospital?"
alcoholism,,"So I am well on the way of becoming an alcoholic. If I not already am, that is.

I need tips on how to get off of it before I start feeling the physical dependence/withdrawals, as I don't really feel any real problems with it yet. I know they're right around the corner.

I just get so bored when I'm sober, the days are getting *long* whenever I don't drink.

I am (self diagnosed) depressed, alcohol numbs that and let's me enjoy everyday things. It even helps me get put of bed in the morning. I need ways to distract myself, I guess.

The last thing I wanna do is work work work.
Maybe you have any tips on hobbies? Beginner level is what I need.

Something that can keep me busy hours on end, most days of the week.


General tips are VERY welcome as well. Thanks."
alcoholism,,"4 Days Sober Canâ€™t Sleep and Stomach Pain I went from drinking a half a fifth of vodka 3 to 4 days a week to just being done.  Iâ€™m over it.  But my stomach feels cramped, I have a headache and I canâ€™t sleep and sweat like crazy.  Is this normal?  Screw drinking.  Iâ€™m just over it."
alcoholism,,"Struggling Hard to know where to start with something like this.

Almost 5 years ago I nearly drank myself to death. Spent a week in the hospital after a serious bout of pancreatitis. Following that I cut back for a while, but slowly but surely it was right back to the same old behavior. I wasn't pouring vodka down my throat but I was still getting smashed most days.

Two DUIs later it's become obvious to me that this isn't something I can tackle alone. I'm terrified about attending meetings, I'm a bit of an introvert and I get very anxious around new people.

I'm also anxious because I'm not religious and there just aren't any secular programs in my area.

Yesterday I had to get the breath lock installed on my truck and I'm utterly humiliated. I know my girls are going to see and hear it and ask me what it is and that breaks my fucking heart.

I can't believe that this is what I've become, I'm so ashamed of myself.

I don't even know why I'm writing this here. But thanks to anyone who reads this."
alcoholism,,"Went over the top after starting uni Hi, im 19 and have had bad anxiety as long as I can remember. Before I started uni in september I was very anti alcohol, which is how my parents raised me. I hadn't drank at all before I started 

Social pressures (*everyone* drinks loads) and never having tried it before led me to start, which really was around the beginning of November. I was bullied at school, and doing this with lots of people was the first time I felt I fitted in. I was definitely drinking too much, all of it socially. I also want to be clear Im not addicted to alcohol in any way, I just had poor self control and no concept of the consequences. I had days / weeks off here and there, and when I came back after Christmas I had a week where I went out 3 nights (not in a row). I had my worst hangover which passed after a day or two. 

However, as I'm predisposed to anxiety it started me thinking what I'd been doing the past few months. I decided I'd either cut down or stop altogether. Two weeks into that I went on a pre planned night out and was careful about what I drank, and following more consideration decided after I was going to stop altogether. 

Im having really bad anxiety about what I've done to my body. I keep prodding and poking things, constantly check my skin / eyes for yellow, I over analyse everything my body does. The only genuine symptom I've had is an on / off sharp (but not bad) pain on my right side. It's been 1 Â½ weeks since I last drank at all, and 3 Â½ since I was drinking too much. The pain went away a couple days ago, came back yesterday and is better but still there today. I know the best advice would be a doctor, but I'm terrified my parents will find out as I know they would be just as angry and dissapointed as I feel right now."

alcoholism,,"Scare of my life second time around. I fell off the wagon around the holiday season and it didn't get bad till last month. I was drinking everyday and switched to the hard stuff (not good). So my last drink was yesterday morning when I got home from work, I had one beer left and I drank it and thought I would be able to sleep. I couldn't so I ended up staying awake.

At around 5 pm last night I just had a feeling something was wrong. A tightness in my throat and chest and all I could think about was here we go. By the time 9 pm came around I was pacing around my house like a lunatic just trying to control my breathing and i was forced to call out of work (i work nights). So I muscled through the first night but knew if I was already this bad it was going to get much worse. Swallowed my pride and went to the hospital.

When I woke up in the hospital I met a man who told me this time I was lucky and next time it might kill me and that I needed to get help. Thankfully they didn't keep me overnight and I was able to get some sleep. Each time you withdrawl it gets worse and I don't think I can survive a third time, not with the way my chest felt. So I have to start today, I am an alcoholic and I can't let it kill me. thank you for reading."

He's kind of getting better, in that he doesn't drink as often as he used to. However,  his ""benders"" are still just as bad and last more than a week. It always just feels like a giant breach of trust, because as a family we've tried telling him time and time again that he can open up to us when he feels like drinking, because we feel like it'd be a healthy way to deal with his cravings, but he has never done that. He never opens up to us on the bad days and only brags about how well he's been doing on the good days. Why can't my dad just open up and be honest about his emotions and cravings?

alcoholism,,"I'm 21 and I am deathly scared of becoming an alcoholic. I created this account only to vent my fears of it. Ill try to make this short, basically I love to drink like most my age. My grandmother is currently and has always been an alcoholic, my grandfather was once one, my uncle is one depending on the phase he's going through. My father chooses to drink in moderation out of fear and he definitely has control, but, has also shown he could become like them if he was on the wrong path. Then there is me. I have always been fine with or without alcohol. Ever since turning 21 I kind of went a little wild. I now psych myself out. If I am not entertained, I want to drink cause why not. I am fine going without it like I said, if I am busy. It holds me back from accomplishing fitness goals or smaller things I want to do in the day because I am lazy the next day or feel like crap. I don't always drink to get drunk but 75% the time I am. I find the excuse to get drunk 3-4 nights a week. If I didn't have this family history I wouldn't be worried but still, I shouldn't drink like this. The fact that I even have these scared thoughts makes it feel like a problem. I care so much about health and fitness and day time-im fine because I am busy! but night comes around and me and my boyfriend get bored, so why not sometimes? Then on top of all this I have about 4 friends I consistently hangout with and 3/4 I only drink when I hangout with. Basically I just want advice on what everyone thinks! Like I said I psych myself out- I will be thinking ""i actually don't want to drink that's not fun and doesn't make me feel good"" then the other half of my brain is like ""just do it you'll feel great its fun"". I also am becoming more socially awkward because I feel the need to drink to hangout with people.  I get super excited to drink too, it's ridiculous. I see someone else who drank 3 times in one week (which they probably never do) and so i feel like i can too.  I'm scared I am headed down a dangerous path. Thanks for any help/opinions/anything."

alcoholism,,"Starting Day 1 today... I'm not sure if I'm an alcoholic but I'm going to assume I am for the better of my body and mental health and the people I care about around me. I can't just have a beer or just two. I have to drink every single one until they're gone. 

I don't crave alcohol but when it's around moderate is not a word in my vocabulary. I'm usually a happy drunk until I'm not. I'm already super emotional when I'm sober and with drama currently existing in my life and who knows when that will give up there is just better ways to get the emotions out than thru alcohol. 

I'm just gonna play it safe and learn to say no thank you and keep the healthy side getting healthier.

alcoholism,,"""Kindling"" and how it would apply to me? I didn't even know what this term was for a long time and I still only have a vague understanding, but from what I've read I'm terrified of it.

I'm mostly a binge drinker. When I'm being disciplined I'll only binge 1-2x a week. When I'm being lazy it can creep up to as much as 5x a week. But then I'll often take a few days off of drinking to recover. I don't experience bad withdrawal symptoms, however I once went to the doctor at about 3-4 days sober and my heart was RACING. She attributed it to PAWS. The most withdrawal I get is a fast heart beat, a bit sweaty, and trouble falling asleep.

I guess my question is, am I at risk for this kindling effect? I often go a couple days on, couple days off, in terms of my drinking. I've been trying to go longer periods sober, but it's hard. But I've heard it's actually worse to be doing this, as opposed to drinking every day (maybe not bingeing though) *because* of this kindling phenomenon. Is that true? Is on and off sober worse than just being a drunk or completely abstinent? The concept makes me extremely nervous. Thanks for reading."

This morning, she remembers none of it. She says she went to bed at midnight (even though I didn't get home till 1:45 am) and was even puzzled by the spilled drink on the floor, she thinks the dog peed or something.

alcoholism,,"Not sure how I (20F) should leave alcoholic BF (30M) who has a violent history. Been together 18 months, living together 14. Worried about welfare of pets. TLDR;      Not sure about best way to leave alcoholic BF, worried about our shared pets welfare, advice from others who have been in his position? 

How to break up with alcoholic bf with violent history? 

Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m leaving my emotionally manipulative bf. Heâ€™s ten years my senior and weâ€™ve been together 18 months or so. He is all I could ask for when sober (or if heâ€™s just had a few) but when heâ€™s drunk his personality changes. 

When we got together he was living with his dad with no job, no license and no way to function as an adult, having just been released after a four year jail stint. I got him a job soon after and have driven him to work every day since. I got him his permit, but he failed his test, so Iâ€™m still driving. He has another booked, but has not made any effort to book lessons or drive with his dad. 

I have been unemployed myself for much of the time, living on benefits while studying. Iâ€™ve worked a few temp jobs but otherwise heâ€™s provided for me (except for when we first got together). He is a good provider. 

The underlying issue is his drinking. His family are multigenerational alcoholics. His father frequently drives drunk, and heâ€™s been in trouble years before for driving without a license and drunk driving / drug driving. We have three cats, two of which are his (we have adopted them since we got together). He has thrown things and accused me of cheating when drunk, heâ€™s threatened to kill me and my family, heâ€™s gotten me fired because of his behaviour at work functions. Heâ€™s damaged relationships between my family, friends and myself, and Iâ€™m constantly apologising on his behalf. 

I have gotten a house with a friend, and can move in shortly. But Iâ€™m not sure how to go about leaving. 

I am worried heâ€™ll immediately turn back to drugs, smash the house up and hurt the two cats I canâ€™t legally take with me (this is my biggest fear, other than him hurting me). He is extremely dangerous and can and will hurt people if heâ€™s angry enough. 

I donâ€™t know if I should take my cat and go, or if I should just take them all regardless and leave. Iâ€™m still responsible for taking him to and from work, so leaving during the day is tricky. I also donâ€™t know wether trying to talk it out with him will end in me getting hurt. I donâ€™t want to leave my pets to be abandoned by him if he returns to jail or drug use (meth), but on the off chance he keeps himself together and finds a way to work, he deserves to have his cats as company. 

My real estate agent is letting me break lease early under the DV act and is very supportive so I donâ€™t have to worry about that, thankfully. 

I know itâ€™s long, but what would you guys do in this situation? Any advice would be so helpful. 

Thank you all."

The initial caffeine might have been for something innocent or positive (at an AA meeting for example) but then the second the caffeine hits him, all he can think about is drink and his drink of choice is a highly caffeinated wine. What came first, the alcohol addiction or the caffeine addiction? I guess he loves the â€œhighâ€ from the caffeine and talks about being able to feel his emotions better (he has horrific mental health issues) and that everything is clearer.

alcoholism,,"What can I do for my boyfriend (28)? I feel at a loss. I don't really know how to start....I have lived with my boyfriend for most of our relationship, almost 2 years. His drinking has been a problem on and off for pretty much the entirety of it, though I didn't realize it at first. It's difficult because he can take ""breaks,"" from drinking after he's had an episode (like stopped completely) and he can go months drinking more moderately (though still more than I think the average healthy adult does?). 

He ruined my 30th birthday with a drunken episode, in which he came back at 3 am very intoxicated with a stolen, huge metal sign for our town's farmers' market. Then he fell/slumped backward on the bed into our bedroom window and broke it. This, after he was very rude to me at a restaurant and I walked out. I was convinced that I was going to break up with him the next morning, but he was so apologetic and seemed so humbled by it that I was sure he was going to shape up.

The worst of it is that when he drinks he tends to get mean-spirited. If I disagree with him on something or see he's getting pretty intoxicated and I try to ""stop the party"" he gets mean. He blacks out when he has a serious episode. Once he tried to get out of my (moving) car when I drove him home, then when I closed the door he started beating the dash with his fists, and when we got to our apartment building he kicked the elevator HARD so that the whole thing shook (it was terrifying). He is worst when he blacks out, and unfortunately he doesn't remember any of it so he doesn't realize how bad he was the night before or what it was like for me to deal with.

He hasn't had any major episodes like the ones I described above in 6+ months but a few weeks ago he stayed up late watching television while drinking beer. I had gotten into bed earlier to read and had fallen asleep. When I woke up it was 1:30 am and he was still up watching television. I kind of groggily walked into the living room and was like ""Geez I fell asleep, what time is it? What are you still doing up, hun?"" I brush my teeth, get back into bed, and am almost asleep when he starts getting upset with me over something that happened the day before. I was shocked because I'm well... essentially asleep, and its almost 2 am at this point. So I just said ""Babe, WHERE is this coming from?! It's 2 am! what are you doing?"" and that sets him off: ""Why do you have to be such a bitch, etc. etc."" I couldn't deal, and went to sleep on the couch. The next morning I told him I was moving out.

When I had the conversation with him about my leaving, I said ""look, I'm open to this being a break rather than a 'break up.' I'm open to working things out. I love you, I want to be with you, but I can't keep re-living this same pattern and subjecting myself to this."" We're good together, and I feel comfortable with him, like I can fully be myself. I've dropped by to see him in the almost three weeks since. We text each other. I don't WANT to officially end things. But 2 weeks into being separated, I went over to have dinner with him, and afterwards he says ""I'm gonna go have a couple beers with E. and play darts"" (this is a friend who he tends to get into trouble with). I was really upset; it just felt so disrespectful. Late that night, I get a text from him that he fell off his bike after drinking, broke his nose and cut his upper lip open so badly he needed stitches and would have a scar for the rest of his life. He texted me about what happened and just said ""you win, when you're right you're right."" 

I thought that might be a wake up call for him, but I think he still wants to believe that because he doesn't get into incidents like this all the time, and because he has successfully stopped drinking for a month or so previously after things had got out of control, that he doesn't need quit, he just needs to learn to ""moderate"".

I should add that he suffers from chronic depression (he's on antidepressants) and some social anxiety and I believe he's using alcohol to cope with his symptoms since even with the medication he's still suffering a lot.

**TL;DR** \- My boyfriend has had issues with drinking since we started dating, it took me awhile to figure that out. I moved out of our apartment and decided to take a ""break"" to let him work on things and figure his shit out. I'm not sure he understands the severity of his drinking problem.

I've already physically left our apartment. Should I/can I stage an intervention? How would I go about it? Should I just break up with him entirely, cut ties, and forget trying to resolve things? What can I do?"

He claims he doesn't want to break up or anything but I find it hard to believe that. So now I just feel it is almost impossible for me to actually trust him about anything at all. I'm always suspicious that he's at least had a little to drink and sometimes he's honest when he has, other times he's a complete liar about it. The more obviously wasted he is, the more likely he is to lie about it. 

He's sometimes really difficult to talk to about things like this. He gets very defensive, rarely apologizes,  and is just aggravated anytime I try to bring up past actions.  He acts like I'm just supposed to forget it all ever happened and just move forward, but that's hard to do when it has happened so many friggin times.   

I can't afford to do therapy right now, so can't work on it that way. Wondering what others have done to start trusting their alcoholic partners again. Also, no I am not open to any sort of alanon meetings.  I get they can be helpful for some, but I'm not one of those people."
alcoholism,,"Alternative to In-Person AA Meetings During Coronavirus Over the last year, my brother and I have been creating a virtual reality platform for people to create support groups. We were focused on mental health issues until my friend said it could help people in AA right now. It's not completely finished, but it's pretty close and usable.

It's definitely not as good as the in-person meetings, but I am hoping it would be better than nothing until you can go back to in-person meetings. It would also be completely free; all you need is an Oculus Go or Rift headset. We aren't trying to make money off this unfortunate situation.

I just wanted to throw this out there to see if there's anyone that thinks they'd like this? I just want to make sure there would be a benefit to it before we rush to put it out for AA members to use during the Coronavirus outbreak."

Iâ€™ve been dating my boyfriend for about 7 months and his drinking is really severe. He drinks about 13-15 beers a day and drinks from the moment he wakes up until the time he goes to bed. 

Every aspect of life has been affected by this hygiene, work, finances. I just really donâ€™t know how I can help him or what I can do for myself to relieve the stress I feel from this. Should I just realize itâ€™s just not going to change? How do I not be a part of the problem and start being a part of the solution? Any advice would help. Thank you."
alcoholism,,"[Relapse] Got wasted and took Xanax Hello friends,

Last night I decided to have some shots of whiskey for the first time in a long time as I seemingly forgot why I quit drinking in the first place. After Five or Six shots I decided to take a few Xanax and relax on my couch which I now know is a dangerous combination.

I have no memory of what followed. 

8 Hours of my life missing, and I'm terrified I did something stupid.

I do know this: I made a stupid mistake.

Alcohol makes me do dumb stuff, it also makes me extremely depressed and I can't touch the stuff anymore.

It culminated in me stripping my clothes off and urinating on the kitchen floor before going to bed. Something that wasn't a first in my apartment but definitely a first being back at home. My dad was the first one up and found my clothes lying next to the puddle of piss. I couldn't even look at him this morning when he told me.

I usually have at least 2 drinks a day (mostly beer) but will often have 5 or so days a week where I drink more than that. The past 2 weeks have been around 4-7 about 5 days a week, maybe 6. I don't want to just stop cold turkey because I want to avoid any potential issues that stopping may bring. Should I just gradually taper down or is there a better way? My goal at the moment is to bring it down to at most 2 per day or 14 per week like I've seen recommended online."
alcoholism,,"Praying itâ€™s reversible  I had a physical about a month ago to get all my immunizations done for my clinicalâ€™s for school. Havenâ€™t had one in years. Blood test came back with elevated liver enzymes so I had to go do an ultrasound. Today I saw the results online. I know I shouldnâ€™t self diagnose and shouldnâ€™t worry until I hear it from my doctor, but it sure was gut wrenching to read â€œABNORMAL: call patientâ€. So until I find out whether itâ€™s alcohol induced fatty liver, or the other stated which is liver disease, Iâ€™ll try to stay positive. These usually donâ€™t have many symptoms and catching it early is the best chance of reversing any damage. So Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™s just the case. I was naive to think that just drinking beer and no hard alcohol couldnâ€™t do much damage."

alcoholism,,"Thinking of Giving My Mother an Ultimatum. Need Advice. My mother recently relapsed after almost a year sober. I spent Christmas with her and my sister, and I really regretted it. I had a horrible time. She's an angry drunk, and she says such hurtful, hateful things when she's drinking.

She's had a problem with alcohol, to a greater or lesser extent, my whole life, It's always been something of a struggle, but it's only after almost a year of being able to have a relationship with my mother as she could be - kinder, less erratic, and most importantly, HAPPIER - that I really feel that I'm not capable of putting up with it any more. It's just too exhausting.

I know my mum is sorry and ashamed, but that doesn't really help. I haven't seen her since Christmas. Tonight she messaged me, inviting me to stay with her while my workplace is shut due to the coronavirus, and I told her, truthfully, that I have other plans. But I can't keep putting off the decision forever. I don't live far away. And what I really wanted to say to her was, ""I'm won't set foot in that house if you're going to be drinking.""

Is that a bad idea? Will it help or hinder her addiction? Complicating the matter is that my mother refuses to use the ""A"" word, even as she acknowledges that she needs to quit drinking. Alcoholics are people who can't hold down a job and who collapse in pools of their own vomit behind seedy bars at 3 o'clock in the morning. Not hard-working middle-class people like her. So I don't know if an ultimatum will only serve to make her dig her heels in.

Thank you all in advance, and I wish you all the best in your fight."
alcoholism,,"I donâ€™t know if I should stay and help or leave. I was with Jake* for 3 years. He was a personal trainer when we met and I knew he liked to drink and lived very much the â€œwork hard play hardâ€ lifestyle but it didnâ€™t seem like an actual problem. Within a year it was clear the drinking was more than that of a normal person, and heâ€™s a very bad drunk (not physically abusive but definitely verbally, and can get aggressive with other men) we ended up getting engaged and he promised things would improve, they didnâ€™t. He lost his job, gained weight which made him feel worse about himself and that just made him drink even more. I stuck around for another year and a half begging, pleading, offering help, booking doctors appointments, everything I could before leaving and whilst he didnâ€™t take it well and the first 4 months or so were very tough, he eventually seemed to sort himself out.

He got back in touch 11 months after the breakup and he seemed to have changed, more stable job, much less drinking, working out again  and back to the same old happy Jake I fell in love with. That was December. Since then there have been at least 4 times where he has seriously crossed the line with drinking, but he drinks in excess without fail every weekend. 

This weekend Iâ€™m in self isolation with suspected corona. I have weakened lungs from childhood asthma and whilst unlikely deadly, it could be dangerous for me. He went out Friday night â€œfor a few pintsâ€ and I took a turn, almost ended up in hospital and I couldnâ€™t reach him. I called him at 3PM Saturday and he was slurring down the phone clearly still drunk. He knew I was upset with him but proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day and then get drunk and go out again Saturday night. 

He doesnâ€™t remember what happened, the whole weekend is a blur. 

Iâ€™ve ended things but heâ€™s begging me not to, he says that this is the wake up call he needed and heâ€™s going to get help this time. I said Iâ€™ve heard it all 1000 times. Heâ€™s called me in tears begging me for one more chance because he canâ€™t do this without me. At this point I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m helping or enabling and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning myself trying to save him.

alcoholism,,"How do I talk to my partner about their alcoholism? 
Hey everyone, before I get into the question of this topic, let me provide a crumb of context. My partner and I have been together on and off for nearing two years now. During this time, he has coped and tried to overcome alcoholism. And Iâ€™ll admit, I havenâ€™t been the most helpful person when it comes to such things. 

In the past, I would become angry and disappointed due to some of the things heâ€™s done and said while drinking. I also would have little patience as I felt like I had to treat him like a child in order to take care of him while heâ€™s drunk. 

My whole life, Iâ€™ve never been raised around good role models for drinking responsibly. Iâ€™ve had old friends in high school who are now alcoholics. The town I was raised in had a huge problem with drunk drivers killing high schoolers and other people at least a few times a month. So Iâ€™ve never had a proper example of what drinking responsibly is like nor have I been taught how to talk to someone about their drinking problem. 

Now, presently, my partner has corrected their drinking problem (kind of). But last night, we were at one of their friends houses drinking, and my partner had way too many beers. My partner ended up being overwhelming, and I was tired as hell and just wanted to sleep. I tried my best to be patient, but my patience wore thin. Everything they did began to bug me, and I started to blame the alcohol once again. They ended up becoming very frustrating during the whole night, and we woke up and had a bit of an argument over the whole thing. They had to go off to work, and we decided weâ€™d talk about it later. 

But thatâ€™s the thing guys. I donâ€™t know how to talk about it without getting upset and disappointed and angry. I donâ€™t know how to go about this. Please give this stupid redditor some advice on how to talk to their partner about alcoholism."

My boyfriend is in a band and i went to one of his gigs last night and drank a lot of vodka. I went completely off the rails as i was so drunk and we ended up in a massive fight afterwards and i was really nasty to him, to the point that he got into his car, drove away and slept in it overnight to get away from me. He came back this morning understandably angry at me and said he doesn't want to break up over it but no longer wants to be around me if i drink again and has said he will just drive away again if i drink when he's there. 

My binge drinking like last night has happened before, but not that often. The first time it happened, he forgave me but as it has happened a few times, he is getting more and more angry with me. Which is perfectly understandable. I feel so awful that i acted this way and i have no idea what to do. I am a completely different person when drunk and i hate it.  

Have any of you had massive drunk arguments with a partner? How did you help the situation afterwards? What do i do to move forward from this? Have any of you guys managed to reconcile with loved ones after drunken moments? 

I have currently moved to my parents to allow him some space, i just wish i could go back in time and not drink. 

Any help is massively appreciated"
alcoholism,,"Advise on avoiding withdrawal symptoms I'm seeking advise on how to reduce my withdrawal symptoms from alcohol.

I'm a 40 year old male who has been drinking in excess daily for about 8 years now (15-20 drinks per day). In the past I've gone through bouts of difficulty sleeping (night sweats, sleep paralysis), the shakes, and anxiety when cutting this down to under 10. I've been taking vitamins (and B-complex) for a number of years, but no drugs aside from caffeine. 

Recently, I've been able to cut down to under 12 drinks per day (as low as 6). But while doing so, I experienced extreme headaches (this has subsided) and an inability to get a good amount of sleep (this is improving).

What should I do from here in order to be as safe as possible? When should I try to go cold-turkey? If I continue to tapper, how should I do it? I don't have any urge to start drinking heavily again (yet), as I'd rather be healthy with this COVID-19 pandemic active."

I had the presence to already know what cars were around me, slow down, move over, throw my flashers on, and call 9-11 all within about 5 seconds. I didn't stop because it didn't look like a safe situation as more cars were following at high speeds. But man, if I had still been drinking, even if I was dry while driving (which somehow I always was when driving, although i can remember waking up still drunk from the night before and having to take the bus to work at 6AM, and sleeping in stock rooms, ah good times), I'm not sure I would have missed hitting a car there.

I am a daily drinker at a pint or more a day. This has been going on at this rate for a couple months. I've been drinking daily overall for the last 6-7 months.

A couple weeks ago I started getting random numbness feeling in my left foot and leg that I brushed off as a potential injury from moving things. It comes and goes. A couple days ago I started getting blurry vision and sparks/flashes in my vision like floaters (similar to looking at a camera flash light or the sun by accident and looking away and seeing dots) and that would come and go. Around 6 hours ago I had a few shots of vodka and ate a sandwich. Well not long after I felt heavy and numb and a brain fog clouded my head, and my vision started to blur. It made me very anxious to the point I had an anxiety attack. I ended up puking. My friend tried talking to me and I had trouble interpreting her as if I had confusion but I knew she was talking and I could respond it just felt really passive. Afterwards, I still felt heavy and more exhausted. I felt like I was going to lose consciousness. I had an orange juice and some pretzels and started to feel a little better. The feeling of anxiety attack went away for the most part, but I still feel odd after the ordeal and a bit confused. I am currently back home and I feel extremely tired and my vision is still a bit weird and my foot feels kind of numb. I have a random pain in my left side that I'm not sure if it is related. I just overall feel really exhausted as I'm typing this. My friend told me it could be low blood sugar. Sometimes I would get similar symptoms as I did earlier when I wake up and I figured it was just slight withdrawal because I would also feel shaky so I would drink and they would go away temporarily. This has been going on for a couple weeks.

alcoholism,,"â€œModerate drinkingâ€ isnâ€™t working. I need to stop completely. I donâ€™t have access to AA meetings. Any advice for quitting completely and on my own? Iâ€™m not surprised. Iâ€™ve had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I need to stop completely. Itâ€™s hard to imagine. Why canâ€™t I just control it? How will I feel less shy and anxious without drinking? I use it as a crutch to feel confident and numb pain. What will social events and holidays with family be like? Drinking is a very big part of my families life, but I donâ€™t want it to be like that for my future family.

Iâ€™m 21 but I began drinking when I was 15. Iâ€™ve tried to drink â€œlike a normal personâ€ for about two years now. Basically just closet alcoholism. Before, I was drinking the same large amount, just more frequently and in public. It was more noticeable. At first it was just the thing to do, and then I started drinking to help me cope. Iâ€™ve had mental health problems from a young age. I would drink when I got sad. I would drink no matter what activity I was doing. At the movies, concerts, parties, home in my room and even before school some days. There are many times where I shouldâ€™ve died. Even back then, people would pull me aside and suggest that I get help. I lost friends. I know that if I donâ€™t stop now, I might either lose everything or die from drinking. I donâ€™t want to miss out anymore or ruin relationships. I have an amazing relationship and I need to stay focused as Iâ€™m close to graduating college.

Iâ€™m just stuck in the moderate drinking attempt and fail. When I met my fiancÃ© is around the time I started my attempt at controlling it. I basically go without it for a while and then I blackout and am right back where I was. He knew about my struggles with it in the past and he has tried to offer advice and remind me of my limits, but I surpass them almost every single time I drink. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m a raging alcoholic every single day. But when itâ€™s bad, itâ€™s bad. My fiancÃ© has seen me go through these cycles of â€œokay Iâ€™m being healthy now and taking a breakâ€ then just completely blacking out. I have never done anything to ever directly hurt him, like Iâ€™m not going out to clubs/bars or getting arrested but at the same time these relapse moments still do hurt him. Theyâ€™re not fair to him. Iâ€™m not being the best person I can be. He thought that I was going to actually die at one point and I hate that. Iâ€™ve seen alcohol ruin too many relationships. 

I donâ€™t have normal hangovers either. Itâ€™s not an â€œow I have a headacheâ€ hangover. I had a somewhat high tolerance back then, but now I  get sick for hours on end and have severe pain to the touch on my stomach and back after I drink. I think itâ€™s an allergy but I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s 2 am now and Iâ€™m still hungover after drinking yesterday afternoon.. And the mental mess it creates is horrible. I try to pick up the pieces that I broke. Most of the time Iâ€™m totally alone but other times I have to apologize to people for quite literally taking care of me when I get so drunk Iâ€™m laying on the floor, and then I reply back to worried friends who I abruptly stopped replying too because I passed out. Someone has to make sure Iâ€™m laying on my side so I donâ€™t accidentally die. Then I make the same excuse about how Iâ€™m really petite so I misjudged my limits. Feel like a terrible person. Repeat. 

I hate drinking and the cons definitely outweigh the pros, so why do I still do it? I become someone I hate when I drink. But I drink (partially) because Iâ€™m someone I hate. Yet I know deep down that one cannot hate themselves into health.

Iâ€™m in a long distance relationship and although my fiancÃ© is very supportive, we canâ€™t physically be together until the end of this year. The people that Iâ€™m surrounded with in my everyday life arenâ€™t the best influences. They donâ€™t really acknowledge drinking problems in general and they all drink a ton. Itâ€™s hard to not give in and agree to drink, and view it as one harmless night. Although I think I tend to have the most trouble not drinking when Iâ€™m depressed and alone.

alcoholism,,"Advice/alcohol changes my mom Hi all. First post ever so sorry if the formatting isnâ€™t right or whatever may be. 

Came home from school Thursday after classes were moved to online due to coronavirus. I knew it would be straining on me mentally, but not so soon.

My family dynamic is a bit complicated. I grew up witnessing my parents domestic violence quite often and when I was quite young. This has caused a lot of issues for me personally, but my parents have never tried to hear me or validate anything they have put me through. They â€œmake upâ€ for it by paying for my college tuition. Which I am thankful for, yet any time I have mentioned therapy or the abuse is brought up, my mom turns it into a joke and acts like I am dramatic. My parents have never gone to therapy either and the physical abuse is no longer, but their marriage is quite the roller coaster and not exactly a happy one. 

Anyway, my mom drinks. Every single night. It depends but on weekdays she may start as soon as 4/5 and weekends like today it started at 2. She drinks wine and seltzerâ€™s, never hard alcohol. But that doesnâ€™t matter. When she has a few, she changes a lot. If me and my siblings are in the kitchen (we always hand out at the island) she will just sit against the counter and stare and become very slurry and just straight up confrontational and rude. We all hate being around her when she is drunk. 

Tonight, me and my two younger sisters had come back from the store and were sitting at the island. My mom is staring at me, I ask why, she asks whatâ€™s wrong. I was just quiet and sitting on my phone because I could tell that she was drunk and I donâ€™t like engaging her or talking to her when she is. So I just sat there. I told her my stomach hurt (cramps) and she asked why I was drinking a soda. I simply explained that the soda wasnâ€™t why and I had been feeling icky all day. A few minutes go by and she is making a comment that my sisters lemonade was â€œdisgusting and filled with fake sugar, just like sodaâ€ and I said â€œeh, a lot of things are bad for youâ€ and she then raises her voice and says â€œthen donâ€™t bitch!â€ I explained that I had not complained at all and only mentioned it when she asked. We then get into a fight, and she uses her favorite jab at me â€œif you are going to come home from college and act like this...â€ yada yada. She loves this line and I canâ€™t ever seem to escape it. Iâ€™m pretty financially dependent on them (my dad is the only one who works and we have no issues however) and yet she is always the one to throw money and stuff in my face. I donâ€™t know how I am going to continue to live here until August. Any advice on how to handle her and not let her anger and alcoholic tendencies to get to me would be extremely appreciated.

When I started drinking it pretty immediately turned into problematic drinking, bingeing, drinking to feel numb or better, depending on the day. Drinking to forget. Always hiding my drinking and how much I was consuming. I havenâ€™t had a drink since mid December but the cravings have hit full force. Why after this long? I donâ€™t understand it. But I was so visibly not doing well that one of my coworkers asked me on Saturday at work if I was doing okay. She happens to be a recovering addict herself, with about 2 years under her belt. I guess Iâ€™m just reaching out here for anything. I have no support here, Iâ€™m back living with my parents and I canâ€™t broach the subject with them because they believe drinking to be equivalent to the devil, basically."
alcoholism,,"Rehab Options in the US/Experiences So....I'm a 33/M in Florida that recently got out of the hospital and was diagnosed with Stage 1 Cirrosis.

I have good insurance as well as a father that is willing to help with the cost (he's also dealt with this).

Right now, I'm also concerned about COVID-19 and doing something like this. But that is almost a secondary concern considering I know I need immediate treatment.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on what you think my immediate decisions should be, since I'm a little bit torn about traveling and doing something like this, even though I know I should seek treatment. It's a weird predicament to be in with how things are evolving daily. And also, maybe positive Rehab experiences/places? "

alcoholism,,"[SERIOUS] Seeking resources in DFW Texas. Hello lovely people. I have never been on this subreddit before so please let me know if I have broken any rules. 


I have a family friend who Iâ€™ve known for a couple years now. He is in his mid twenties, has alcohol related seizures multiple times a week, and is basically a dead man walking. I know thereâ€™s nothing I can do to help him as he needs to help himself as is extremely resistant to opening up and being honest about his feelings and struggles. All his â€œfriendsâ€ and even some of his family members enable his alcoholism even though he likely has irreversible brain damage, and at the rate heâ€™s going, will die within the next couple of years, if not much sooner. Basically everyone talks about his issues and how they feel helpless behind his back but no one will actually confront him with his own reality. What little friends he has maintained, want to help him but are just shut out. I know this is pretty common with those struggling with addiction and mental health. 

Itâ€™s a vicious cycle. 

I just want to get a packet together of available resources for him because thatâ€™s honestly all anyone else can do for him at this point. He went to rehab about five hours from here, where his dad lives, then stayed with him instead of living in a half way house. However the moment he moved back home, he immediately relapsed. He has been to MHMR (country services) and should be following their crisis program. However, the only reason he is following their program is because a Mental Health Deputy will be knocking on his door if he doesnâ€™t appear for his counseling, case worker, or psych appointments. Iâ€™m looking for groups, medical facilities, and any form of assistance where a team of people can teach him the skills he needs to figure this out. Itâ€™s really quite dire at these point.

Thank you so much in advance. I wish all you lovely people joy, healing, and strength. You all are doing such great things to improve your health and spirit. I wish for each and every one of you that you reach the light at the end of the tunnel."
alcoholism,,"I want to get out So, long story short in advance: I'm one of those worst case scenario alcoholics to be cured. I'm a functional one. 

I'm quite a talented bartender and whatever happens (competitions etc.) I stand and deliver. I could do better and I know that, but I get so bored so easily and alcohol just takes the edge off. I just get away with it. And when people start to notice, I just flee.

I have so many things that trigger me to start drinking.

I hate noice. My bf is a really 'sound triggering' person. He eats chips super loud all the time. Scratches his head. Can't communicate with him about it bc of his autism. Result: drink and try to sleep.
My mom is extremely judgemental. Try to make her happy but always get some kind of comment. Result: drink and try to go to sleep.
My ex tried to kill me last year. People tell me to get over it. Result: drink and try to go to sleep.

I know I'm being difficult, but it feels like everytime I want to talk about it to people, it's just a burden to then, and in self defense I just start drinking, numb myself out and 1. Walk away from it all or 2. Give them a proper reason to hate me and be self destructive.

I've studied psychology myself so every time I seek help, it's like I already know what they'll try to do to help me."

alcoholism,,"I always fuck up my relationships with drinking Okay so this happened like two days ago and I'm really fucking depressed about it. I have this female friend who I met a few months ago. We became fast friends, super close and sharing deeply personal thoughts together. I always had a small crush on her, however, and I fucked it up so badly that she blocked me and texted me telling me to never speak to her again. Yep, it was that bad.

I expressed my feelings for her one time and she said she saw me as a wonderful friend but didn't have romantic feelings for me. I decided to continue trying to be friends because I genuinely did like spending time with her. We were able to go back to our normal friendship and it didn't seem like she minded at all.

But then I guess two nights ago I got really drunk, and on Instagram I saw her hanging out with another guy friend. I guess I got jealous and started posting to my Story about how annoyed I was, she demands my attention all the time but doesn't like me, yada yada. I also tried facetime calling her a bunch even though she was declining them.

Anyway I deleted the message threads out of embarrassment without reading them, but she wants nothing to do with me ever again and I'm really sad about it. A really great friendship that meant a lot to me, gone after one night. She was who I would always confide in when I was sad, or happy, or whatever â€” now i feel so alone. I would pay so much money to be able to take that night back.

This isn't even the first time I've done this with a girl I liked before. I've been blocked in the past by another girl for drunkenly harassing her online too.

alcoholism,,"Alcohol for me was a crutch out of heroin. Itâ€™s a socially acceptable vice, and now I find myself a 31 year old functioning alcoholic wanting out of this party. The hardest lesson of all my addictions has been to let the party go on without you. Itâ€™s the hardest thing to do and the absolute best thing for you, biologically and socially and personally. 

I learned this lesson once already kicking heroin, and I thought that was my lowest point but no. Heroin addicts hide you donâ€™t normally see them in your day to day life. Alcoholics like me function directly under and around the umbrella of normality. Suffering in broad daylight in the presence of everyone is absolutely worse. And suffering in self enforced silence being able to throw up a facade good enough to keep them away another day or more... it is an affliction. 

I want out. My partner downplays the effects, but heâ€™s just an addict at an earlier stage. Such denial I feel nostalgia for. I felt I had it under control. So wrong I was.

I feel too young to be feeling so old. I am aware of the biological affects alcohol is having on my body. Iâ€™m 30 pounds overweight (itâ€™s like carrying a 3 year old child all day every day) I canâ€™t breathe at night I must prop up my head to align my respiratory organs, I canâ€™t run for any length of time I tire so easily (I used to run 8 minute miles five years ago). Iâ€™m irritable when I used to be jovial. Iâ€™m still quite positive for others, but at the end of the night Iâ€™m combative even in absence of drinking.

My boyfriend drinks everyday and gets hangovers every few months. Recently we had plans to hang out for the day. He was able to drive over but when we were getting lunch he started having a bad headache and was unable to eat anything. We go back to my place, I give him ibuprofen and an ice pack, and we end up napping together for a few hours until the hangover passes. He apologizes a lot for messing up our day, we hang out for a bit, and then he suggests we get dinner. He orders a margarita. Am I being ridiculous to find this concerning? I can see a college student doing this, but he's 30.

He gives a lot of external reasons for why he drinks a lot. For example, he's said he drinks so much because he had to stop smoking pot for his job, and recently he said that it's because he inherited a high tolerance from his mom (This one I especially don't get. I can eat a dozen cupcakes without getting sick but that doesn't mean I don't stop at two). He never brings up internal reasons (He drinks because he chooses to).

I don't allow liquor in the house and she finds a way to get it and a new hiding spot each time. Every time I step outside for more than an hour, she drinks herself to oblivion.

While I don't drink on the clock and don't drink and drive, I feel that I drink too much at the end of the day. I have 2-5 drinks every night, be it beer, mix drinks, or neat liquor.

I have a history of addiction in my family and have lost multiple relatives to addiction related suicide. I almost lost my father to alcoholism.

I drink flavored seltzer to curb my cravings, but it doesn't seem to be enough.

I only think about these things when I'm drunk. I'm writing this drunk. When I'm sober, I'll tell myself I don't have a problem, and that I only drink socially. The problem is that I'm drinking liquor after my fiance has gone to bed and even when she's around I mix myself strong beverages.

I truly love beer and genuinely wish to open a brewery someday that works with local animal organizations to find homes for less adoptable dogs (I have a sound business plan).

Please help me rediscover a healthy relationship with alcohol. I want to make my fiance proud and be a good dad to my dog.

One day while he was at work i found an old stash and i panicked. I didn't know whether to tell him or not. He has never been understanding or empathetic. He refuses to educate himself or even ask me how I'm going in terms of my recovery. It's hard. However, I love and respect him so I wanted to tell him, to maintain honesty. I kept it in a drawer to decide later as I had my two kids to look after. But knowing it was there sent my anxiety sky high.

alcoholism,,"Online Support Hey everyone -- so with everything going on in the world, a friend of mine and myself thought it'd be a good idea to start some sort of online support because a lot of meetings in the US and all over the world are being closed due to the coronavirus. We planned on starting a support groupchat/online meeting through group facetime and the free video app Zoom. I'd be interested to hear anyone's ideas and if anyone is interested. Thanks!

alcoholism,,was recently discharged from a rehab sort of got kicked out bc i didnt get along with the director. friends i made want me to visit them. visitors are allowed in unit and around the facility. will they allow me? or does it depend on the place?
alcoholism,,"My friend is on house arrest. It will be revoked if she tests positive for drinking. She is currently begging me to go buy alcohol for her. I've known this person for an extremely long time and have kept in contact with her, but my life is not really tied to her.'s I'd be sad if she went back to jail, but I don't know what to tell her. She's been sober for more than a year, but went to jail for a few weeks back in January because she tested positive for marijuana use. 

That incident put her on house arrest, which has really been bringing out the boredom, so she's asking me to bring her wine. I've refused and will continue to, but is there anything I can say to help?"
alcoholism,,It's hard to stay sober when it feels like the world is ending I am in high school and live with my parents and am now over 70 days sober and trying to go to meetings when i can (though that doesnt seem to be an option anymore) and ive been struggling everyday and its taken most of my energy not to have a drink. but now it feels more pointless than ever and i need some reasons to stay sober despite it feeling like the apocalypse due to the virus shutting everything down and blocking access to friends and activities
alcoholism,,"My shakes get so uncontrollable during work and whenever Iâ€™m sober.  I can barely drink it spills everywhere. And Iâ€™m a server so serving drink has gotten bad to the point Iâ€™ve spilled hot water all over myself in front of a guest.

Because of how crazy things have gotten with this virus I no longer have the option to buy alcohol (the stores arenâ€™t open for long) and Iâ€™m refusing to let myself leave my house to buy it regardless because my mom is older than 60 with asthma. 

As Iâ€™ve been drinking less I shakes and my body parts quake or jump at random times. Iâ€™ve also lost my appetite. What else is next for me... this is super hard already."
alcoholism,,"My wife is an alcoholic and is struggling with sobriety She has been sober this time for 1 month and 9 days. As I type this, she is on her way to get alchohol after having a bad day. 

Our whole relationship has been hard because of this. I've offered to go with her to AA or NA, counseling and such. I know I am not perfect either, far from it, but I try to be as supportive as possible. 

Sometimes I wonder why I stay. We have 3 beautiful young and intelligent children and I don't want to ruin their lives. I myself am a product of a broken home, son of an alcoholic. I don't want to put them through the pain of a divorce. I don't want them to carry the same scars. 

I love my wife so much. I don't know how long I can hold on though."
alcoholism,,"Hot and cold cream helps my cravings Hi guys

super random but i though i'd share (also if anyone else has tried this i'd love to hear)

im a college student and i go to a crazy party school. ive started to realize i like the feeling of drinking especially after something really stressful. Sometimes in the middle of the school week i feel like i need something to drink but to combat this i start putting hot and cold cream on my stomach and chest area to mimic the burn feeling of digest alc. surprisingly it works really well and suppresses any cravings i have for a while.

has anyone tried this before?"
alcoholism,,"Resources for young people struggling? Hiya, Iâ€™m 26 years old and have begun to realize over the last few months that what I thought was a â€œdrinking problemâ€ might just be alcoholism. I decided to stop altogether (10 days sober today) but I need more community/resources than just myself. I canâ€™t afford outpatient. Iâ€™m hesitant to do AA because I associate with the middle aged crowd, and I know that it is religious/Christian and I am not religious and wouldnâ€™t really feel comfortable in that kind of environment. 

Anyone know of other resources? Maybe anything specific for the modern hip woman who also is an addict?

alcoholism,,"Does alcoholic gastritis heal? I was recently diagnosed with Gastritis (alcohol and stress induced, mostly). I just started taking PPIs, havenâ€™t had a drink in two weeks and am adjusting my diet.

alcoholism,,"Want to start drinking.... I recently partied 3 weeks back to back as two of my closest friends were getting married to each other. 1st week: Bachelor Party, 2nd week: Destination Wedding, 3rd week: Saint Patrick's Day

Each week I reconnected with old friends, ate amazing food, traveled to new cities/countries, and drank. Drank a lot. 

I'm not one who drinks regularly, but when I do, I tend to binge. Last time I drank was New Years when I didn't pace myself and blacked out. This time around I was a bit more careful, but surprised myself at how well I could hold my alcohol.

On several occasions, I had 16+ shots over 2-3 hours and didn't lose my shit. No blacking out, puking, or passing out. In fact, what I remember most is that feeling of happiness. Whether it was cans of Whiteclaw, shots of ice cold Tito's, or crisp ginger beer + Jameson, I miss that feeling of warmth and joy that alcohol gave me.

Now, back home in the states I'm self-quarantined at my parent's house for 14 days and find myself craving some Jameson and Whiteclaw. This is the very first time I've wanted to drink by myself and I'm a bit concerned.

Looking inwards, I have a void. A sort of hollowness that I'm constantly looking to fill somehow. Whether it's reddit/youtube, swiping through dating apps, or chatting with randoms to pass the time, I've been distracting myself constantly to avoid the void.

I'm craving connection, but haven't been able to find it and I fear that the warmth of alcohol will be replacing it..."
alcoholism,,"Has quitting alcohol made you less social? Iâ€™ve been sober no problem now for the last 3 months which is great. Used to drink 3-4x a week, heavily during the weekends. That was consistent since I was about 22, and Iâ€™m 27 now. Anyway, I quit because Iâ€™m a destructive person when I drink and my hangovers are awful. Since Iâ€™ve been sober, I donâ€™t like going out in public anymore. I donâ€™t like being around my â€œfriendsâ€, because they still drink a lot. I donâ€™t have a problem with that, I just donâ€™t like being sober around inebriated people. I find that I just donâ€™t like being around people as much anymore now that I donâ€™t drink. Iâ€™ve turned into a hermit. Iâ€™d rather stay home and away from everything. I donâ€™t like going to restaurants. I just like being home. Have some of you experienced this?"
alcoholism,,"I don't want to lose my dad. Please help. My dad's been drinking my whole life. He's a successful person and that fuels him. He earns a lot of money and that's on top of all of his moral system. He loves us by giving my brother and I money (and he really does - he's a great father), he buys his ""friends"" with money (e.g. he buys them drinks all the time) and he feels superior to most people because of his money.

That's probably also the reason that he feels like alcohol and cigarettes won't kill him. It's not like he doesn't know the effect that they have on his body - he knows perfectly well. But he copes with EVERYTHING using alcohol. And most of the times he doesn't even need a reason to get drunk. Whenever he's drunk all he talks about is his money and how well he's doing at his job and how all of his colleagues suck at the job. While he drinks, he also smokes. A lot. Which also concerns me.

I've tried to talk a lot to him about it. I've told him that I'm worried. I've told him that this can't go on. He always says that periodically he checks his liver and lung function and I am not sure if he really does. Mum left our home for a few months because of his alcoholism. Back then he begged a lot for her to come back and promised that he will change. He said that he's consulted a specialist. And indeed, when she came back, there were a few sober months. Then it all came back to ""normal"".

I don't think that he really wants to quit it and I don't know how to make him want it. I'm sad, I'm worried and I'm tired. Please, help."
alcoholism,,"Is drinking 6-9 beers most nights for two weeks enough to go through withdrawal? I am 37 and never had a problem with alcohol. In fact I hardly ever drank until last few weeks. I am working from home and have been so bored with self isolation. Anyway, I just realised I am drinking way too much at home lately. Not getting drunk but start around 5 and go till bed. I know this is nothing like what some people are dealing with but think its time to stop before this becomes a problem."

I donâ€™t want to die young. Iâ€™ve never touched illicit drugs in my life due to a close friend dying young but I feel alcohol is my illicit drug.

alcoholism,,"I don't know what to do anymore.. I'm 25yo male and I'm alcoholic.. I've been drinking since I was 16 doing immature stupid stuff using fake IDs and shit to get alcohol 

I regret it tho cause now I lost all my friends from acting stupid and wreckless, I got my license suspended for DWIs and I don't even like drunk drivers I said I was always so against that and now I'm one of those ppl 

I drink everyday I drink all day and I have no one that cares I tried to just drop it and go cold turkey but the shaking and cravings are way too bad it's embarrassing to go out like that

I've had job after job and I can't keep it cause I'm always drunk or hungover and have to call in ""sick"" or saying something ""came up"" it's gotten to the point that quite honestly I don't give a f*vk I'm not even making enough money to buy much anything so I just spend it all on alcohol and no food most of the time 

I drink whatever I can get, beer, wine, whiskey, vodka I went to my mother's house not to long ago drunk asking her for anything she could give me and wound up somehow taking  champaign she saves only for special occasions, I feel guilty for taking it but what can I do? 

I can't stop drinking and soon I'll have to move in with her or be homeless cause I can't keep up on my bills and she won't take me in unless I tell her I'll stop with the drinking so I'll probably lie and hide my drinking like I've done before and I quite frankly feel disgusting really

I'm like a failure and I can't remember when I was sober I can't help but destroy myself I don't know who I am anymore I black out and do things I never thought I would I've been hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning I've tried going to AA once it just wasn't for me I'm drinking now writin this I'm afraid to stop and I don't want to

Alcohol is my only comfort, my only happiness, I know it's killing me but I love it it's like a toxic relationship I can't get enough and I'm a disappointment I tried to kill myself once and that didn't work either I'm just a lost cause its gotten so bad I've thrown up blood my whole body aches I can't picture my life without it and I'm always thinking about it

What else can I try I've tried everything and everyone I know says I don't care if I hurt them but I do I just can't help myself 
My own mother even told me I'm selfish and haven't tried but they don't know what it's like or how hard it is I'm not me and I don't know what do anymore I think I fear I'll just drink myself to death and I feel helpless to stop it"
alcoholism,,"Could drinking really be a problem this young? I'm turning 22 soon and I drink a bit more than my friends and they think I might have a drinking problem.

I mean I go to parties like my friends and maybe I tend to be the one totally drunk in the group but that's not to say I'm an alcoholic. I know that I can get really crazy when I'm drinking sometimes(been in arguments while drunk and tried to start a fight once) but isn't that normal behavior? People get into arguments with their friends all of the time.

Sometimes I can start drinking a little early on in the day(about 12:00 o clock cause around lunch time) but it's usually just depending on the amount of stress during that day. I wouldn't say I always get ""drunk"" but I do love the feeling of a good buzz when I'm stressed out.

I've been having about 4 glasses of Vodka a day generally, I'll have two in the afternoon and 2(sometimes 3)when I come home. 

I go like actually real drinking only about 4 times a week? But it's not like I'm always alone, however I do enjoy some time alone to just kick back and relax and enjoy a glass or two when I come back home.

I love vodka, which I know people say is really strong but honestly I never felt that way I just love how it gets me warm inside. I'm kind of shy so before I go to a social event I usually will have a drink before I go, it's not like I'm drinking to get drunk or anything just to loosen up a little (I'm against drunk driving) one drink never hurt anybody and alcohol can actually have some health benefits.

I know when I start drinking it can be hard for me to stop sometimes but that's only because I like enjoying the moment and unwinding.  I've only blacked out a couple of times but I promised myself not to drink that much again. My memory can be kind of patchy but not a total blackout I still remember bits and pieces.

There have been times where I've had a drink the next morning to help get over my hangover but it's not all the time, and I had good reason. I can't just be so hungover I can't concentrate on anything for my classes and job.

I wouldn't say I can't stop drinking, I just like it. Does it really seem like I'm an alcoholic?"
alcoholism,,"Just a bit of milk. Iâ€™m constantly reminded of when bill rationed with himself to pour a serving of whiskey into a glass of milk; again and again... yet he got drunk. 

I Still ration with myself everyday and when I get through one moment and then the next you can and you will have that sigh of relief.

My brother is suicidal which is partly why heâ€™s begging me not to hate him. I donâ€™t but I donâ€™t know how to feel. I feel gross. I feel uncomfortable being around him and the rest of my family.

Shaking, laying in my bed. Don't be like me. Please. I was diagnosed with cirrhosis at 24, I'm 37 now. I don't know what's going to happen to me."
alcoholism,,"Husband of 15 years has been slowly sliding into functional alcoholism for 12 years. How to respond? This is a LONG story, but Iâ€™m going to give the key points below:
- husband had gastric bypass 12 years ago, and that changed something significant about his relationship with alcohol
- began with binge drinking and during a couple of those binges over the first few years, he got extremely irrationally angry with me and also got physically intimidating with me (like visibly holding himself back from hitting me or crowding my space). 
- since that time he has not continued the physically intimidating or irrational behavior, but the drinking has gotten progressively worse.
- he now routinely drinks 6-12 or more beers a night, stays up really late, and sleeps in really late
- overlaid with all of this has been him lying to me and gaslighting me about his drinking for two extended periods. He tells me he isnâ€™t drinking, or is drinking far less than he actually is, even when I ask him to his face, and once lied to me for a whole year straight
- He does go through periods of not drinking at all, but thereâ€™s always eventually a reason after a few months or less that he needs to just have a few
- i caught him drunk on the sofa in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago. I thought he was having a glass or three of wine in the evening (I wasnâ€™t thrilled with this, but it was an improvement). Turns out heâ€™s also been buying 40s of cheap beer and also drinking 1-3 of those every night. This is why he hasnâ€™t slept in the bed with me for months. 
- once I caught him, he confessed, but I still donâ€™t know what to believe. He did confess to drinking in the morning for the first time recently, and said that scared him
- he of course appeared very remorseful and ashamed at being caught and at lying to me and about the drinking
- when I caught him after the year of lying about drinking a few years ago, I told him I knew he would mess up and make mistakes, and that the only thing I needed from him was honesty. I didnâ€™t tell him he had to stop drinking, I just wanted honesty. It took a long time for me to think I could trust him again. Now after this second extended period of lying, itâ€™s clear I cannot trust him about alcohol and he is indeed a functional alcoholic.
- heâ€™s been out of work for almost a year, for unrelated reasons (as far as I know) so him sleeping it off isnâ€™t affecting his work, and he is actively looking for work and has some prospects
- he hasnâ€™t had any bad behavior in front of our kids, and that seems to be a boundary he really wants to stick to because his own father was an alcoholic

Okay, SO. Here are my questions:
1. He says the only way he will get through this is if I am not angry at him but supportive instead. I initially agreed, but I AM angry, Iâ€™m just not showing it. Am I actually enabling him by not expressing my anger? Will me being angry actually make him want to drink more and then make this all harder?

2. What kind of boundaries are reasonable for me to set? We got rid of the alcohol in the house (I hope). Is it reasonable to tell him he canâ€™t drink around me, and there can be no alcohol in our house? Iâ€™m abstaining to try to make it easier on him.

3. Does AA actually work? If so, is there a way for him to attend meetings online during the pandemic? We canâ€™t afford therapy right now and I donâ€™t know what else to do.

In almost every other respect he is the perfect partner, and we have two amazing children together. I will not be walking away from this relationship without a fight. I just donâ€™t know what direction to move in, and I donâ€™t know how to help him and help myself."
alcoholism,,"I can't tell if this is alcoholism or anxiety 22M. Joined a frat freshman year and learned a million drinking games and bad habits. I'm no stranger to the occasional night of binging.

As far as my drinking habits go, I probably average about 10 drinks a week. A beer with dinner a few times and a little splurge on friday. Maybe a few glasses of whiskey. About once a month the stars will align and I'll go get rip-roaring drunk with friends. Never black out but I may get sick. This has been pretty constant since my 21st a year ago, since now I have no restrictions on buying.

Never had any issues with the law, skipping work or school, avoiding responsibilities, etc. All of my friends and my father, when asked, have said that I do not have a problem. But drinking's a big part of college and my family culture so their definition of ""problem"" may not be accurate.

Here's the kicker. I have anxiety, worsened by this pandemic. I worry a lot about my health. I sometimes become fixated on an irrational belief that I have a condition. Last fall I was convinced I had diabetes despite working out 6 days a week and only felt relief after having bloodwork done. Many of the questionnaires about alcoholism are about personal feelings. (IE: have *you* ever wondered if you should cut back?)

Long story short, I cannot trust myself to answer a question like that. I was whole heartedly convinced that I had either diabetes or a brain tumor in the past year. Further more, I can easily go 2 weeks or more without drinking. During that time, I feel no strong urge to drink. Drinking doesn't cross my mind unless it's hot out on a Saturday afternoon and I think ""yknow what sounds great? An ice cold beer.""

However, my stupid brain has convinced itself that I'm having alcohol withdrawals. I keep telling myself that I just don't drink enough to experience withdrawals, and that compared to others I have the habits of a mormon, but there's still some nagging fear that I'm just in denial and that I'm slowly sliding down the path to destruction.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I'd rather ask those with real experience. I love myself a good whiskey or a cold beer and it'd just be a real bummer if I had to give those up."
alcoholism,,"how to stop? long story sort iâ€™m a 16 year old idiot that has let her mental issuse rule over her life. i wont go in to detail but some pretty dark stuff happened to me. i used all sorts of terrible coping methods that almost killed me when i was 12. i moved to cigarettes when i was 15, so currently i have 2 addictions to fight. but alcohol is worse.

i think tjis started around 14 years old, a year after the worst thing of my experiences happened to me. it developed really strongly last summer, and i only realized this was a problem in the winter break. i git really drunk on christmas eve and until new years there was 0 days where i was sober. 

right now iâ€™m writing tiis after a little wine. still siber enough but can feel it. 3 days in and iâ€™m still pretty sober to write this down but the world is spinning a little. same story, havent been 100% sober in the last 3 days. amd idk how long this quarantine thing will go on but once i start drinking and actively continue thereâ€™s no real escape for me. apparently there have been runors that schools will be cancelled all year. so iâ€™m pretty dead if you look at it that way. 

death is no stranger to me and im honestly scared iâ€™ll drink myself dead as an attpempt. so does anyone here with more life experience than this dumbass wirting tjis jave any tips on how to stop once youâ€™re deep in the shit?

thank you so much in advance."

Don't have a doctor I trust to give me advice on this.  Tried Nal but had very bad side effects.

I have been to a couple of social events and people have offered me drinks that Iâ€™ve declined in fear that if I touch alcohol, I will inherit my mumâ€™s alcoholism. Iâ€™ve tried to search it up on the internet with conflicting evidence, so does anybody know here whether I have a chance of becoming an alcoholic?

alcoholism,,"Alcoholic Pandemic  

I wish I listened to myself before this virus. This is hard to admit, but yes, I am an alcoholic. I'm not going to go into my full history, but long story short, my new year's resolution was to quit drinking at home alone. I have anxiety and depression issues that I will be talking to my therapist about, though I can't afford more than every 2 weeks. I have daddy issues, which I think are the root of my mental health problems.

The reason I am writing now, is that despite my acknowledgement of my problems, I cannot shrug off this need for alcohol. I've been at home for 4 days now, yet I've binged on alcohol twice. I do my yoga, coffee, exercise routines for a few hours, but after 3-4 I am lost on how to keep myself busy. I cook, but only once or twice a week, and last time I cooked while drunk.

It's hard enough to be sober during this pandemic, being an alcoholic is so fucking hard for me. I need help thinking of ways I can keep myself sober, I don't know what to do.

I can't be the only one struggling with sobriety during this pandemic, please let me know what you all are doing to curb these drinking cravings."

I am also afraid that if I donâ€™t give it up and never look back, then eventually, he will emerge again and who knows what will happen that time. If I say so myself, Iâ€™m a pretty good husband and father, but I could be doing it better. Anyway, thanks for reading. Just looking for, I guess, anyone with a similar situation and some advice."
alcoholism,,"Dating an alcoholic I (28F) am worried about my boyfriend (37M) and our future. We have a loving and fulfilling relationship and are very much in love with each other. Weâ€™ve often talked about marriage and living together. He has been an alcoholic for most of his life. He has had several DUIs in the past and a few years ago he completed a 2 year Christian rehab program. He lives with sober roommates and his boss is also sober. Iâ€™m the only person in his immediate group who drinks. My roommates drink too so when he stays with me he wants to drink. Iâ€™ve expressed my concern after seeing him drunk a few times. He will sometimes black out and not recall the night before, leaving me to make sure he is okay. I recently noticed he was hiding alcohol and drinking it in his room alone. His boss smelled alcohol on him a few weeks ago and told him he would be fired if it happened again. I love him dearly and want a future with him but I am really scared about how this is going to affect us. I want him to be sober. Alcohol has ruined relationships and jobs for him. I just donâ€™t know how to support him or help him. I donâ€™t want to give up on him because he is honestly the best person I know. Even when he is drunk. I guess I just need advice on how to help him stay sober."

alcoholism,,"Reactions to getting clean from others Has anyone ever dealt with others weather friends or family members having disdain or resentment when you hop on the wagon,and start doing the right thing? Almost like they always expected you to be a fuck up, and would rather see you in your addiction. Maybe it makes them feel better about themselves...""at least I'm not like so and so."" I think that once the person decides to make such a polar change to their lifestyle some of those around them dont know how to take it almost, or seeing someone make such a change makes them look at their own faults and they dont like that. Alot of people cannot understand what it was like to live in addiction. I've had people treat me like I'm a piece of shit, and act like they are better than me bc they didn't go thru what I did. I am a pastors son, my father pastors a baptist church where the congregation is about 80-100 people where everyone knows eachothers business. Being the pastors son, and having struggled in addiction with people talking dosent help. Reading people's body language and faces is not difficult, and I am almost shunned or not treated the same as others and it hurts, and I never wish to go back... Like they never made mistakes smdh... hypocritical to what jesus said on how to treat people... the apostle Paul killed Jewish wemon and children and GOD chose him so that just goes to say that past mistakes dont define you!!!  Some people make the assumption that since we went thru shit like this we are worthless, terrible, disgusting people and that is NOT true. They dont understand and have never lived thru this shit. I dont care what they think, I dont care what they say, I dont care how much trash and gossip they want to talk. I have nothing to prove to them. Everyday that I do better and rise up, the more they can get pissed off and proven wrong. I am getting happier every day and finding a new peace!! Slowly and surely I am becoming a different person. People change, I guess some people cant or wont accept that. Their problem...I wish I never went thru this shit honestly, but it has made me stronger.

I do have addictive tendencies, but alcohol has only become an â€œissueâ€ in the last year or so. 

Basically Iâ€™m drinking a handle of vodka in around a week, or sometimes a little more. I drink every night, usually shots or a mixed drink followed by shots. I donâ€™t really have a gauge for whatâ€™s normal and whatâ€™s not, as my family is pretty dysfunctional and my dad attaches a ton of shame to drinking. I could go through a handle a year and heâ€™d guilt me for it. 

Since I dont know whatâ€™s â€œnormalâ€ or acceptable, I was hoping for some input here. I know the amount thatâ€™s â€œtoo muchâ€ is different for every person, so I guess Iâ€™m wondering how you realized your drinking was a problem. I know the answer is usually if you think itâ€™s a problem, it is. But I really like alcohol and find myself defending my use quite a lot.

alcoholism,,"Well... here I am So I met this girl on a dating app a while back. We've been texting almost every day for the past few months. She has been out of the country, with plans to come back soon, but given the whole virus situation that has all been delayed. We finally FaceTimed for the first time two days ago, and had a ""virtual happy hour"". She's a really cool girl, and I've really enjoyed talking to her, so I was pretty excited to finally get to chat with her ""in person"". Well I poured a drink and was doing fine, and then I poured a much heavier drink and remember nothing after that point. I woke up in my bathtub, with my arms covered in bruises from falling. I had texts from her asking if I was okay. My laptop was shut so I was hoping that I just abruptly left the conversation before blacking out. I've blacked out before, I've embarrassed myself before, but this was a new low. The next day I reached back out to her and apologized profusely, she told me she had never witnessed someone pass out like that (so great, she saw everything) that it was okay and not to worry about it, but I am worried about it and it's not okay.

Not only do I feel terrible that I made the world's worst first impression with someone that I was pretty excited about, but I feel terrible about letting myself down yet again. I had a night like this in December, and told myself I would never let it happen again. Since that night I probably only drank maybe three or four times. 99% of the time I can manage my alcohol fine, but it's that last 1%, when I just go completely off the rails. I'm tired of playing this roulette game of which night I'm going to have this time.

My last relationship was a marriage that ended in divorce, and for the last 6 months or so I've been trying really really hard to get my life on track. Physically I've been taking great care of myself as far as eating right and exercising regularly, and I've been trying so hard to stay positive. But now I've slipped up. I have felt so terrible about myself these last 36 hours. I just boxed up and tucked away all of the alcohol in my house (which was a lot). I don't want to feel this way anymore."

Weâ€™ve began talking everyday since February. He came over for the first time a couple weeks ago and stayed 5 nights. Well we drank 4 out of the 5 nights he was there. I didnâ€™t think much of it. He told me when he met his only vice is occasionally smoking a cigarette. Well today he told me he lied and heâ€™s an alcoholic. He also told me that in a couple of days heâ€™s going to rehab for a year. I canâ€™t visit him because I canâ€™t drive. But he told me heâ€™ll call me if they let him. I told him Iâ€™ll wait on him. Heâ€™s also been in the Army for 2 deployments so maybe thatâ€™s why he drinks. My mother is a meth addict. She has a year clean and she graduates in November from drug court. I get off probation in a year and 5 months. So I will only have 5 months left when he gets out of rehab. I donâ€™t really know how long weâ€™ve been together but when we met he called me his girlfriend and told me he loved me. I told him Iâ€™m not going anywhere and I know this isnâ€™t gonna be easy. Iâ€™m pretty sure he doesnâ€™t want me to tell my family so what should I tell them when they ask about him? Also what are some ways I can keep myself busy?

alcoholism,,"(M/36) Doctor told me today that I have to stop drinking immediately or she'll stop prescribing me crucial meds. Looks like it's time to go cold turkey. How should I prep? I've gotten wasted every single night for about 3 years. I've been preparing to quit for a few months ever since a scary liver enzyme test result, and have significantly reduced my intake in preparation. But I'm still drinking a pint of gin each night. I have excellent insurance and planned to finish off my detox at a nearby inpatient center that specializes in this, but that's no longer an option given the virus. I also feel like the ER is off limits due to the virus. 

My doctor just emailed me and basically said, ""Detox immediately or I'll stop writing you prescriptions."" She and I had initially planned a tapering-down schedule, but she seems to have gotten quite concerned about my health and needs me to stop drinking immediately. As in tomorrow.

So, people who've been there before, how should I prepare? I live alone and no family members or friends can come by to take care of me. I'm well stocked on food, toilet paper, meds, and other essentials, and Mom is willing to drop groceries and meds by my door if detox lasts for weeks or months. Two of my prescriptions--Valium, which should help deter potential seizures, and Suboxone, which should help with pain--will come in handy. 

What should I expect in terms of symptoms? What will be the worst aspects, and how can I ameliorate them? Are there any foods, supplements, or anything else that might help with the suffering? I'm really scared."
alcoholism,,"Alcoholic dad Iâ€™m really needing help here.. my dad drinks every night after getting off work and tonight the screaming was one of its worst. He keeps ranting about how he works 12 hours a day at a shitty job and uses that against us (rest of my family). He got in our faces and says we hate him and well, to a degree it is really close to hate, but not quite. Heâ€™s a completely different person sober vs. intoxicated. Says heâ€™s gonna quit his job, that heâ€™s the one that makes all the money, he doesnâ€™t give a shit about us, and you can never get any point across to him and if we are right about the stuff we say, he reverts to using my moms weight as a reason he drinks and rants about how that is a problem and how she needs help with that even though she isnâ€™t obese, and calls out everyone elseâ€™s issues while heâ€™s at that. 

It all just doesnâ€™t make sense. Iâ€™m (M22), still living at home and feel held down. I sense negativity in the house whenever he comes in, and I havenâ€™t had an actual conversation with him in months cause I despise his actions. Despise how he consciously decides to drink when he knows thatâ€™s why we â€œhateâ€ him, and frankly thatâ€™s exactly the case. He knows he needs help but doesnâ€™t want it and doesnâ€™t think thereâ€™s a way. Please I need advice for my mom, me and my siblings (M20, F10) on how to handle this.

When I got into my teens, I dealt with severe depression and anxiety and the only way I could connect with my Mom was when she would drink and party with me. I had to watch my Mom go in and out of mental institutions and rehabs - sometimes even having to live in them with her - throughout my entire childhood.  

I won't keep going through the past, but eventually I ended up hating her for many years and stopped talking to her for 3 after having my own children and moving to another state. The more I started to learn about trauma, I started to have a sense of compassion for my Mom and when she contacted me and told me she was sorry, we started talking again. 

My Mom is what they call a ""functional alcoholic"". My Mom drinks herself stupid when she knows she doesn't have to be to places like work or social gatherings where she has to make a good impression. She's done it for a long time and seems to think she has it under control, but theres some weeks she would completely lose it and call me crying saying how much she wants to die and how she's tired of drinking. 

So with the coronavirus forcing her to work out of home instead of her office, I was worried from the beginning that it would cause her to drink herself into a hole of misery and it has. She is about to lose her job because she hasn't worked in over 4 days. She says she just drinks and goes to bed. 

I've struggled with addiction myself, but alcohol is an entirely different demon I've never personally had to battle with outside of having to battle my Mom. 

When I moved back to my home city, I thought my Mom was doing a lot better, but I learned she's just gotten better at masking it and the closer I got the more I realized nothing had really changed as far as her alcoholism. As much as she's hurt me, my Mom has a lot of great qualities and I still love her and want her to be happy. She currently has a new girlfriend who isn't helping her and all she does is drink with her. My Mom even said just now when I called her that ""she's no good for me"". She was drunk and crying, and hung up. 

I want her to get help and be around for her Grandkids, and I tell her that, but I don't know how to best support her that would encourage her to get help. She gone through so many rehabs and she's 53 years oldâ€“ when is enough going to be enough?"
alcoholism,,"Negotiating How the hell do I stop negotiating with myself? I'm trying to cut down (not necessarily completely stop) because lately the number of days I drink has been creeping up, and I almost always get drunk when I drink. It's affecting my health, and drunk me thinks it's a perfectly fine idea to be up until 2:30am when I have to work at 9am.

Anyway I find myself by day 2-3 sober having a CONSTANT negotiation going on in my head. One minute I'm thinking ""no I absolutely don't wanna drink tonight, I can wait until the weekend"" and then 3 minutes later I'm thinking ""well as long as I'm in bed by X hour I can drink"" or ""I had an annoying day, I deserve to relax tonight!"" Or ""okay I can drink but ONLY if work out/do laundry first/etc.""

Honestly it's exhausting. It dominates most of my thoughts during the day, and the constant ""yes I'm gonna drink tonight"" and ""no, I definitely won't"" has my head in a constant state of whip lash. It's also really anxiety inducing, not knowing if I'm going to stop at a liquor store on the way home until I'm actually HOME.

Are there any tricks to just shutting my head the hell up? I don't want to argue with myself for hours in my head. I've gone to a few meetings, but I haven't really felt they helped, and generally the first thing I think after leaving a meeting is ""god damn I really wanna drink now."""

alcoholism,,"Searching for help Hey everyone, first time posting on this sub. 

I've been drinking since I was 13 years old (I'm 25 now), and I remember the first time I ever drank I stole beers from the fridge at my parents house during summer break and had one beer-and one beer quickly turned to 7. I was completely alone during that first time I drank, and I've been binge drinking by myself ever since. I cannot control myself when it comes to alcohol. 

I started using opiates about 2 years ago, but quit within the last few months. During that time, I wasn't drinking but since I've stopped using opiates, my drinking has ramped up again and I've essentially replaced one substance with another. I've been diagnosed with poly substance abuse disorder by numerous doctors, but have never seen the urgency to stop using or drinking whatever is available to me. My life has never drastically fallen apart, and I've actually gotten my shit together recently. However, alcohol is still that beast that lurks in the shadows of my mind and I've never really been able to completely stop. I know that if I don't quit, my life will inevitably reach that breaking point-I just don't know when or how it will happen. 

I'm getting to the point where I feel regret the morning after drinking, but that regret has never been enough to get me to quit. I realize I need to stop, but I honestly don't know how to defeat this. I've been to AA meetings a few times, but I've never stuck with it. 

How do I stop drinking? I feel helpless at this point and I know I need to quit, but I honestly don't have a clue of how I'd do that. Can anyone share some sage advice, or even personal experiences with quitting? What was the moment when you finally had enough? What helps you stay sober, and how did you go about getting sober?"

alcoholism,,"20-year-old-alcoholic So, with a smorgasbord of mental ailments (depression, anxiety, PTSD) I've definitely added alcoholism to the list. To get STRAIGHT to the point, I can easily down a handle (1.75) of whiskey in about 2 days. As much as I would like to quit drinking excessively, I've tried a lot of things. That will include exercising, long walks with my dog, so much. But I just can't seem to kick the habit at such a young year of age. 
I would like to know, are there people who have drank as much, possibly more than me, at my age, am I just a lost cause? I know that I would cause my family heartache because I succumbed to this. Rehab is so mentally draining (trust me i know)

I have an issue with not being to stop when I start drinking. It only ever lasts one night on the weekend. I have drank all night and until 5am.

My partner has been trying to avoid alcohol and is normally good at this. He can go a month without and normally self control and stops after 2/3 drinks. Sometimes he can go on binges. Right now he is on day 4. He drank the equivalent of 2 handles of vodka and today I came home to his side of the bed littered with beer cans. He also quit his job.

As the title says my roommate will be leaving detox very soon. I'm looking for advice about how to manage my relationship with her because the last four days have been anxiety inducing. For context, my roommate was admitted to the hospital by me and had a blood-alcohol level four times the legal limit. Over the last four days she has been having auditory and visual hallucinations. The hallucinations were so bad it caused me to flee the apartment in fear. 

I want to be as supportive as possible because I know that alcoholism is a disease but I don't know if I am the person to support her at this time. I'm having a lot of anxiety about the idea of her coming back to the apartment but I don't want to punish her because she at least made the right choice of allowing herself to be admitted into detox. 

If I were to move out of the apartment she would have nowhere to go but I'm not sure if I can ride out our last 3 months of the lease with fears that she will relapse and another incident will occur. 

I gave her an ultimatum which is why she chose to go to the hospital, but even at the hospital when the social worker was speaking to her she wouldn't admit to drinking. 

I'm just looking for some guidance I'm sorry if this doesn't fit the rules of this sub."
alcoholism,,"Relapse and quarantine Hello all. Yesterday I was 22 days off the ol sauce, today I'm zero. I got off of work, and had an hour until my train came. I convinced myself the wait would be to boring without a buzz. I wasn't in a terrible mood or going through anything tough, I was just bored. I'm not craving today, but I'm a little concerned how willingly that beer came to me. I can't get strung out on booze again. I usually smoke and take kratom to get through the day when I feel I need a drink. The guilt isn't horrible, I've been here before and know that guilt doesn't get you far. How are you guys dealing with quarantine and sobriety?"
alcoholism,,"Break up with Alcoholic boyfriend So yesterday my boyfriend and I unexpectedly broke up. He has problems with alcohol and the night prior he got completely wasted and said horrible things to me. He said these things in front of his friend who quickly stood up for me and confronted my boyfriend about his drinking problem. My boyfriend got extremely angry and kicked his friend out of the house. I was very upset and knew I was close to my breaking point with him. 

Weâ€™ve been dating over a year and I have had several discussions with him about his drinking. Our last discussion prior to our breakup, he finally admitted he has a problem stopping when he drinks and he asked me if he should start attending AA. I told him I will support him if he starts to get help somehow. But that I was not going to put up with his behavior any longer (trying to initiate fights with random people, saying horrible things to me, peeing himself when he sleeps after drinking, passing out in Uberâ€™s and me having to drag him out of the car)

Yesterday morning, I confronted him about his behavior the night before. He did not remember ANYTHING and felt horrible for doing &amp; saying what he did. This time I told him this was his last chance to try to get help/get better/stop drinking or I would leave because I donâ€™t deserve to deal with that. It took a hell of a lot of me to say that because I love him so deeply and really donâ€™t want to lose him. 

I think hearing me say that I was going to leave him was a huge blow to his ego. If we were to break up, he wouldnâ€™t want to tell people â€œshe left me because of the alcoholâ€ so he changed the subject up something entirely unrelated. 

He said that he wasnâ€™t sure how we would be able to make our relationship work in the future because he will he enlisted in the army in a little over a year once he graduates college. I mean I get where he is coming from, but that is a year away and not the pressing issue at hand. And, with the coronavirus and just futures in general, everything is so uncertain. So many things could happen so I felt like it was a dumb idea to break up based on a uncertainty that we wouldnâ€™t make it in the future. I honestly feel like he just did that so he could â€œbreak upâ€ with me and try to make the break up not about his drinking. And also maybe he thought that breaking up with me would mean he could continue to drink and not have to change his behavior?

Iâ€™m just completely and utterly heartbroken. He said he â€œdid not want to break up and that he loves me a lot and doesnâ€™t want to lose meâ€ and I said â€œokay, then letâ€™s work this out, get you better, and see where this goes. Weâ€™re already a year inâ€ but he said breaking up now will save us heartbreak later on, which is BS because before this he has said he wanted to stay together even with the uncertainty about the future. 

I just want him to be the best he can be and be healthy and happy. I donâ€™t want to see him face a major consequence later on as a result of his drinking. 

Do guys think he did this to avoid his drinking problem? And do you think this was not a wise decision on his part? Do you think Iâ€™ll try to get back with me? Idk Iâ€™m just torn to shreds."
alcoholism,,"My (22M) girlfriend (22F) is working so hard to beat her addiction. I want to help her but I don't know how My girlfriend is 2 months sober. She's working so incredibly hard to better herself and Im so proud of her. She's been going to AA meetings and they've been really helpful but they were recently all cancelled due to the outbreak

She's been really struggling lately, with all the COVID-19 stuff on the news and having recently started a new job. It's really driving her anxiety through the roof

All I know to do is be supportive and present when she needs me. When she wants to talk, I listen, then when she wants to hear my advice, I give it. The problem is that I can't relate. I don't know what she's going through.

She's strong and I know she can get through this, but it breaks my heart to see her in such emotional and physical pain. What can I do to help her through this?"

alcoholism,,"Needing Some Reassurance Sorry for the long post... I hope this posts as well bc Iâ€™d like to get help anonymously. As my name suggests, I fly for a living at college. Also, Iâ€™m not yet 21. My story with alcohol has only lasted 3 years. I never drank until prom weekend the last weekend of school. In college I hang out with a bunch of kids who are in Greek life and therefore drink several times a week. I never did. This year in January I met one of my neighbors: he was a college dropout and my Uber driver one night. We started hanging out drinking on the weekends only and he seemed cool. Eventually it progressed to where we were hanging out every day and drinking most of those days. One night he tried to take his life. That really weighed on me and to this day I canâ€™t forget seeing him and taking him to the hospital. I kept telling myself I could do this and fix him because I truly care about people but now Iâ€™ve found out the hard way that him being in my life has knocked me down to the lowest point Iâ€™ve ever been in. I stopped eating, started drinking more because everything was fine when I drank. I would get sad and tired for no reason and thatâ€™s when it started to worry me. I have left college due to COVID19 until August. My last week on campus I would run through probably 12 shots a day which is a lot for me. I started waking up feeling terrible and having to drink to make the nausea go away. I puked twice last week because of the nausea. Iâ€™m back home now and I told my mom. My dad was an alcoholic whoâ€™s not in my life anymore. It broke her heart to hear. Iâ€™ll be sober for at least 3 more weeks simply because I canâ€™t obtain alcohol. I donâ€™t even want to drink on my 21st. Iâ€™m on the end of day 2 and Iâ€™m doing awesome. What isnâ€™t awesome is the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal: shakes are the easy part, Iâ€™ve been hearing voices in white noise and hallucinating a decent amount every few hours, my liver is a little sore and my kidneys too from not drinking any water. I canâ€™t sleep at night. Itâ€™s getting better though. Iâ€™m scared for my career- this canâ€™t be on my record. I know I wonâ€™t let this get in the way of my career in the future like going to work hungover or even drunk but I just wish I could talk to a doctor. The same thing applies for mental health, something that I hadnâ€™t dealt with before. Iâ€™d like opinions or someone whoâ€™s dealt with a situation like mine to help. Thanks"

alcoholism,,"Is my problem serious enough to consider going sober? I have struggled with some addictive tendencies all my life. In highschool it was drugs and at 19 I started going to NA, I was sober on and off for about a year. Drugs aren't an issue for me anymore (25 now) and it was never severe for me anyways. My biggest issue is my social anxiety, I have aspergers and drugs helped me enjoy socializing more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've now replaced that with alcohol. I hardly feel comfortable in my own skin, but I love to be around people, and when I'm drunk I feel so outgoing and on top of the world. I don't need to drink every day and I don't get cravings before nighttime. However, when I drink I can't stop myself. One beer becomes too many beers every single time. I'm not the type of person who flies off the handle or does anything bad, but it's still embarrassing to me that I can't control my intake. Even when I know I'm too drunk, I will go out of my way to drink more and more and more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my question is this: Is that alone enough to warrant serious concern? Is there hope for me that I could learn to have self control, or is that just deluding myself? Am I a semi-alcoholic? Should I stop completely or can I try to drink from time to time? I've asked myself these questions many times, and I feel like I need the perspective of people who understand addiction."

alcoholism,,"COVID'NT 19 Hey. I'm 29 and am sober for 4 months now. Recently I've been changing my life dramatically from losing many pounds by hard training through voluntarily helping in animal shelter to creating my own company. And I was bussy, and I was in love and it was beautifull. It gave me strenght and I realize that main reason for many of my problems was loneliness. So i started to hang out with people more. But I was so lonelly I fucked up with the girl, becouse I rushed too much. Fine! I'll learn from mistakes (I Hope). I still can hang out with my friends. But not anymore, since I'm locked down due to COVID-19

And it hit me today. That long forgotten craving. To drink couple of beers, to watch some movie, play some games. Who needs friends when you can do all that and be happy?

I was just googling if I am an alcoholic to assure my conscience that I'm not, so I can drink heavy today, coz its only once right? I'll return to my old motivated self tommorow right? I'll be ok to indulge myself just once, right? 

Sitting in my car. Realizing of what I'm about to do I found this community. And I would be a liar saying that reading motivational stories gave me strenght. No. You guys, as a people, gave me strenght. You showed me that I am not alone with this problem. That I can find in me that control I was about to lose, to continue this fight for little bit longer. You too are sometimes sitting in my car assuring yourself that's ok to drink and You find that strenght to fight it back. And God help me I am with you.

Thank you for this community. And mostly thank You for You

I know I can go awhile without it, i take a break for about a month every once in awhile without even thinking about it (before I had to stay inside all the time because almost nowhere is open).

alcoholism,,"Stopped drinking a few days ago and am wondering if withdrawl symptoms are common I am 30 years old, and have been drinking a decent amount for 2-3 years (7-10+ drinks every day for the last year, same amount every two days for the previous 1-2 years).

I tried quitting a few times myself but it never really took. For about the past two weeks I've been feeling this sudden chest pain in the left of my chest.. only happens a few times a day and only lasts a few moments. Four days ago, I binged and in the morning had the chest pain again so I decided to try and stop drinking (attributed the chest pain to that).

First days' symptoms were really bad (no sleep, sweating, weird heart rythems). Next two days weren't actually that bad.. some headaches and lots of brain fog, but other than that nothing much.

I'm on day 4 now, and about an hour ago just had some kind of anxiety attack or something... huge brain fog, very heavy feeling heart beat, a bit of chest pain (same spot I've been having it for 2+ weeks). It seems to have subsided now, so now all I seem to have is the brain fog... 

Is it possible all symptoms are related to alcohol &amp; withdrawl? Sweating and brain fog are symptoms I had before (in previous attempts to stop drinking).. is it possible none of the other symptoms are related to alcohol &amp; withdrawl? I can't really go to any clinic or doctor, thanks to all this coronavirus stuff, so online resources are all I can turn to.

So I guess my questions are:

\- Is it common to have more severe symptoms on day 4 (or 5)? Rather than in only the first 72 hours?

\- I read online that brain fog can last weeks or even months.. does anyone have any experience/advice regarding this?"

He owns his own business, no employees and needs his license, so this fucked up his life. I worked for him that summer to help him out. He seemed to have got his life back on track until this past Christmas I noticed he had the shakes. I didnâ€™t say or do anything about it but definitely should have. I text him every now and then to check in. He is divorced, his daughter has nothing to do with him, he lives and works by himself. Heâ€™s obviously lonely and depressed. A little over a month ago I texted him but I never got a response and told my dad to go check in on him. Belligerent. My dad couldnâ€™t believe it and lost it on him. My uncle says he fucked up, never again, etc etc. My dad checks in on him for the next week or so while he gets rid of the shakes and things seem to be fine. Last week my grandmother was concerned because he sounded off on a phone call. This time my aunt (his sister) and her husband go to check in. Guess what? shit faced.

It has kind of spiraled out of control. My tolerance has increased greatly, I'm always tired and my memory is laughable. The black out's keep increasing in lenght. I've already lost several friends, missed several great opportunities and put me quite a bit of debt.

Regarding the amount, I ended up (calculated to standard glasses) on about 15 to 25 units within a few hours.

People warned me for cold turkey, so I informed my doctor of my plan. Should the symptoms get to severe, help is just a phone call away. But should I really be worried? Mentally I feel little to no challenge. I have a family member checking up on me if it get's too intense. I'm motivated and feel good about this.

It has kind of spiraled out of control. My tolerance has increased greatly, I'm always tired and my memory is laughable. The black out's keep increasing in lenght. I've already lost several friends, missed several great opportunities and put me quite a bit of debt.

Regarding the amount, I ended up (calculated to standard glasses) on about 15 to 25 units within a few hours.

People warned me for cold turkey, so I informed my doctor of my plan. Should the symptoms get to severe, help is just a phone call away. But should I really be worried? Mentally I feel little to no challenge. I have a family member checking up on me if it get's too intense. I'm motivated and feel good about this.

I didn't drink yesterday evening. I kept sweating through the entire night. I didn't sleep at all. Just didn't happen, whatever I tried. Soon, night no. 02 without alcohol. At the moment I feel pretty weird and keep feeling from freezing to boiling hot which goes back and forth. Headache, dry mouth, muscle pain, confusion. But it's pretty managable.

Is this only the beginning?"

I have a healthy and positive vision of who I could become after this, but I donâ€™t know what to do now. I donâ€™t even know who I am, or whatâ€™s happening. I am afraid to stop drinking too.

Anytime I've had enough drinks to feel that sort of nausea or headache or uneasy feeling, I immediately wonder how this is something anyone would enjoy doing enough to actually get addicted to it. Recently, I watched an episode of Intervention and saw an alcoholic who was pounding liters of vodka daily and was just rolling around, groaning, throwing up, drooling, and passing out. I understand addiction to speedy things...In fact, I quite like taking amphetamine, methylphenidate etc...it feels great, you don't feel sick...you feel alert, confident, talkative, cool, cocky, smart. But, alcohol basically feels like poisoning yourself.

**TLDR**: Would anyone be willing to explain the thought process behind getting addicted when being drunk often feels terrible (at least the next day does)? What the purpose of drinking to absolute sickness is?"

alcoholism,,"HELP PLEASE Do I have a problem? I want to drink daily. Itâ€™s not an uncontrollable urge, I skip days occasionally, but itâ€™s something Iâ€™m always down to indulge in. I drink alone a lot of the time, but I donâ€™t hide it. People know Iâ€™m drinking. That is unless Iâ€™m at my parents house, I sneak liquor from them and get drunk alone in my room because I know they wouldnâ€™t approve.

Over the past few weeks, iâ€™ve been drinking a good amount everyday. 3-5 drinks. I like getting drunk and altering my mental state. I like to get drunk instead of doing my schoolwork and I find myself pushing off responsibilities to the point that I have intense anxiety about getting it all completed. 

I donâ€™t get belligerent, but I do get drunk. I have only blacked out once in recent weeks, and that was not a pleasant experience. When I get drunk I sometimes say things that donâ€™t make sense or that make people uncomfortable. Iâ€™ve had a few experiences over the years where I make people around me concerned for my safety, or where I make them genuinely confused and uncomfortable due to me not making any sense.

I like being loosened up by alcohol. I like forgetting about my anxieties. I like escaping from my responsibilities.

I know this is unhealthy behavior. Iâ€™m just not sure how concerned I should be. Should I abandon alcohol? It wouldnâ€™t be the hardest thing for me. Iâ€™m a stoner as well and I prefer weed to alcohol INFINITELY. Weed has never done me wrong like alcohol has on many occasions. Sometimes when Iâ€™m drunk, I just claim that Iâ€™m high to make people less concerned.

A few of my friends are very casual drinkers as well, but donâ€™t seem to have the same toxic relationship with alcohol that I do. It makes me sad to know that Iâ€™m doing something frowned upon.

I drank a good amount of bacardi last night, over three sessions. I drank first at 4 pm and then helped my mom with something, again at 6 pm and then had dinner with the family, and then again at 9:30 pm before i went to bed. My family didnâ€™t realize I was slightly intoxicated, although I was very conscious of it and trying very hard to hide it.

alcoholism,,"Done with it - today - My story Hi all, I just need to get this all of my chest and since theres no one I can talk to about it I thought I would write it down here. 

30 M. 

Been drinking for the last 10 years on and off. Had a rough childhood and then depressions. No intact family and got fucked over by my relationships over and over again.

For the past 10 years there were only a few sober times. 

I managed to stop for weeks, months and even a whole year and always fell back to it.  Drinking about 4-6 beers each day with some minor interruptions of 1 or 2 days when I was on vacation etc.

Last year I really wanted to stop and got myself checked by the doc. 

I first had a ""lesser fatty liver"" and bad blood levels. I then managed to stop for about half a year. Got myself checked again just to be told liver is fine again and my blood levels are better. What happened next? Of course I thought I can get myself a few beer if the liver's fine again.

Hell here I am again after 8 months doing the same shit. But today was my last day. It's not even that I think I can not make it or get through it. I definitely can and will. My problem is that constant fear of what I have done to my body. You know when you start looking at your skin color, reddish palms . This and that. Checking for symptoms if its too late and such things. 

I never had a problem doing my job or getting life done. There wasnt a single day I skipped job, drank on duty or in the morning. It was always that after work time when I didnt know what to do else. I was functioning. Perfectly.

This will end today. 

What sticks with me is the constant fear that it's already too late. If i look at myself and how I look now,  I will always have that fear of stopping too late with me. I won't even get my blood levels or liver checked for a year and just hope my body will fix itself during my sobriety.

&amp;#x200B;

The only hope I have is that there are people drinking for 20+ years and still get away with it - so I hope I will live through this.

Thanks for reading my story. And best of luck to you."

alcoholism,,"For those who think its time to curb bad habits.. Not entirely positive on how to start a reddit post, especially one like this.. but I'm gonna spitball it and we'll just hope it works.   


Recently kicked beer to the curb, well, the bad habit of binge drinking beer anyways. To give a quick background, I started drinking a few beers a night while playing video games. Being in my mid 20s, after working all day a beer and CoD was the perfect way to relax. When I first started, I could drink about 6, and I was pretty tore up. That number grew pretty quickly, and soon I was buying 6 packs, I was buying 12 packs, on and on until I was just buying 30 packs. Theres a major problem with buying a 30 pack of beer, you kill any chance of forced limitation.. So very quickly, I was averaging a 30 pack every 1.5-2 days.   


This had gone on for about a year. 12-15 beers a night (Sometimes more..), 100 calories ea. Not to mention my terrible eating habits. I exploded, I used to be athletic, slim, 6'0 175lbs and mostly muscle. I weighed myself this morning, 230lbs of fat. My physical appearence wasn't the biggest problem for me, I really didn't care.. but some of the physical side effects slowly creeped up, some of which I didn't notice.   


About a 2 weeks ago I started noticing I had some breathing issues.. it continued to wake me up throughout the night. My first idea? Drink more beer, more beer = better sleep.. right? Wrong, the breathing issues continued to get worse, accompanied by some heart irregularities. My heart would flutter, randomly pound at around 85BPM.. It finally got bad enough that I seriously considered an emergency room trip. I woke up after 4 hours of sleep early one morning, everytime I would try to fall back asleep I would gasp and wake myself up.. I started doing the mental math of just how much I was eating/drinking.. I could easily reach 3500-4000 calories a day.   


It was time for a change, not just with beer, but a diet overall. On the spot I went and pulled the beer out of the fridge, and stored it away (my logic was if its warm, I won't be tempted to drink it). I spent the rest of that day pretty much doing what you would consider a detox.. I didn't have any withdrawal side effects or anything of that matter.. but was drinking plenty of water and did get oddly thirsty towards the end of the day. From that day on I stopped the heavy beer drinking. Started drinking the proper amount of water, portion control etc.   


The first night of no drinking, it did take a while to fall asleep- but once I did, I didn't budge for 10 hours.. I hadn't slept like that in a LONG, LONG time. After a couple of days, I noticed I couldn't feel my heart beat (in my chest), which was something that had became normal. I used to think I was incapable of getting hung over, when it reality I had just normalized the feeling of being hung over. Throughout the day now, I'm more awake, alert, and motivated. I'm losing about 1.5lbs a day (yes, you read that right). I noticed that my face isn't near as oily, my blood pressure doesn't randomly spike up, overall I just feel stronger (even though I'm not doing any real excersise.. all the gyms are closed here).   


All this can be summed up pretty simple, even though a bad habit isn't technically an addiction, it can still severely hurt or kill you. If you're going to drink, drink in moderation.

I used to drink as much as 3 nights a week which was a bit much for me so I made a concerted effort to slow down. I smoke too much pot, I smoke too many cigarettes, I play too many video games, I'm not shy about my problems, but I dont really consider alcohol to be one of them. I dont drink alone, I'm happy to go without, I never struggle with a pressing need to drink, and from what ive seen theres no ways in which my drinking has negatively affected me or my loved ones. I'm a bit taken aback by the diagnoses to be honest. Is there a disparity between the generally accepted idea of alcoholism and the clinical definition? Because I recently slowed down my psychiatrist is jumping fpr joy, and yet for me its not really a huge deal...

Drank every night for the past couple weeks to calm me the fuck down with layoffs happening and virus and whatnot. I do this once in a while, since drinking every night makes me feel great in the morning, but mostly just drink socially.

Yesterday woke up with pins and needles sensation in the fingers, toes, and in the hands. That was the first morning where I had not drunk the prior night, as the day prior I woke up and found I had broken my table and didn't remember shit and slept through a client call I was supposed to be in. That spooked me since it was the first time that had happened. So now I have a broken upside down table in the apartment. As well as broken glass but that's another story.

Anyways back to the point. Pins and needles in hands feet and fingers and toes. Fingertips feel raw, like they were burned. Maybe they were, who knows. Headaches, usually don't get these.. . Is this kindling? My paranoid mind was so freaked out it was neuropathy but frankly I do not have the history of heavy drinking that makes that outcome possible, to my knowledge.

That doesn't stop me from freaking the fuck out and ordering B vitamins. Help me understand his situation and find calm and/or purpose. I hope you enjoyed the tale of how I am one deeply dysfunctional motherfucker. Thank you.

Edit: Actually other than in perhaps a couple locations, it may be more accurate to describe the sensation as tingling rather than pins and needles. A little uncomfortable and it doesn't stop, but, not exactly ""painful"" I'd say"

alcoholism,,"High-school Alcoholic I was 17. Had a beautiful girlfriend, a good minimum wage job, hobbies, and good grades. I took a liking to drinking. It started off as a reward to finishing homework, but it steadily advanced into me drinking excessively atleast a few times a week. Almost always alone. 

Thereâ€™d be times I would show up to school after a whole night of binge drinking, tired and tipsy. My tolerance was strong enough where Iâ€™d be good to go by 6am. It was a regular thing. Itâ€™s where my weekends went, itâ€™s why I wanted to see my girlfriend less, itâ€™s why I fell into a depression. I was too young to realize how much of a problem it was and blamed on everything else, including my relationship. One night while I was drunk, I cheated on my girlfriend with a close friend. I thought itâ€™d make me feel better; itâ€™d cure my depression, but it didnâ€™t. It went on for about a month until eventually she found out. I got jumped by 3 other grown ass men the same day. Canâ€™t even say I blamed them. 

That was a wake up call for me. And the start of a very difficult heartbreak. I stopped drinking that day. Without constantly numbing myself I realized I loved that girl, and that I took her for granted. I also realized I lost a good friend who genuinely cared for me. The break up was drawn out for months, and it destroyed me. I lost my job, I lost some friends, and I lost my girlfriend. To this day, she doesnâ€™t know the problems I went through with alcohol because I didnâ€™t talk about it. To her, I was perfectly fine during my binging. Just distant. Im honestly still recovering somewhat but Iâ€™m a much better person now and grew a lot from it. I got a new steady job, my license, a car, and have real plans for my future.

Since had a daughter with the same woman and got married. Worship her shes amazing and so are my children. Done a great job with them and get compliments all the time on our parenting and how great they have turned out. Not to be a misery and perhaps 1st world problems but due to early fatherhood I stuck a shit unfulfilling job out to pay the Bill's and make sure my kids and wife have a secure family home. I binge drinked heavily from 18 to 24. I then took up mma and like an addiction I was all in. Training 7 times a week, no booze, competed a couple of times and was fighting at a weight of 70kg. I then stopped because my daughter was on the way and I was neglecting my family to train. Since then I have piled on the weight to 115kg.

My dad was a committed alcoholic. Since I can remember he would drink atleast 4-5 days a week. The most he went without drinking was maybe a month. I came to terms that my father had a disease. When I was younger I resented him for all he put us through. I couldnâ€™t understand why he wouldnâ€™t want to change his life for us.. for his own kids. Alcohol took over his life. He hasnâ€™t worked for over 15 years, he works 2 weeks then gets paid and quits because once he gets that first check he has money to afford his liquor. He goes months without working and is on and off. I worked as soon as I was able to. At 15 I would help my mother by atleast paying for the things I needed. Because she was the only one putting food on the table for us. I am 21 now. My dad was getting worse and worse throughout the years and my heart hurts knowing that I couldnâ€™t do more to help him fight this disease. My mother put up with him and loved him despite everything she has gone through. I never had the father daughter relationship with him because growing up I saw him as this mean bad guy who just lived with us. I acted like he was just not there, I ignored all the name calling. The only time I would speak to him is if he came to me while sober and tried speaking to me. That or trying to stop him from arguing with my mother. My dad was constantly told to stop drinking but he couldnâ€™t stop. It seemed impossible for him. I donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to live with this disease, I donâ€™t know if he was actually trying to stop but just couldnâ€™t because the disease took over him. I donâ€™t know what was going on in his head. I donâ€™t know what demons he was fighting. The days he would stop drinking.. the withdrawal it was scary. Seeing him argue with people who were not there seeing him all shaky and scared. Then one month he went on drinking nonstop. My mother told me he would fall and couldnâ€™t get up on his own. He was constantly drunk so she didnâ€™t think anything of it. Little did we know that was a symptom of the internal bleeding he was going through. My dad threw up a lot of blood a day after he kept falling. In that moment he was terrified. My mother was terrified. In that moment he begged God not to take his life yet. In that moment he knew he came to a point in which his body couldnâ€™t take it anymore. He was sent to the ICU. They had to intubate him to take care of the  bleeding. He spoke to my mother and my sister over the phone before that and he reassured us he would be fine. They also reassured him he would be okay because they didnâ€™t think he would end up leaving us. My heart hurts knowing that it was his last conversation. That I didnâ€™t get a chance to speak to him. His blood pressure dropped, and all that blood loss affected his brain. The doctors werenâ€™t sure why he wasnâ€™t waking up and he couldnâ€™t get an MRI because he was so unstable. On the 6th day of being in the ICU he was stable enough to take an MRI. The MRI revealed extensive damage to the brain. My heart sank. There was nothing reversible the doctors could do. They said there was a great chance he would never wake up from this. So we faced the tough decision of taking him off the ventilator as his brain was also swelling and pushing in his skull. I was with my dad the whole time, I told him I loved him that everything was going to be fine. I reassured him that we will be fine. That he was going to be fine. I didnâ€™t want to worry him because some say they can still hear you. I told him to rest. On March 14 he passed away. He was 45. Seeing my dad die was one of the toughest things I have ever done. My whole body felt numb. It felt surreal and still does. Iâ€™m glad I was there with him in his final days. But I also wish I could have spent more time with him.. I wish I spoke to him more. I wish so many things. I wish I could of done more for him. I miss him so much. I just want to hug him one last time but I canâ€™t. Alcoholism is a disease idc what people say. Please get help if you need it or know if somebody who does. I hope anyone who is going through alcoholism finds strength to turn their life around. Blessings to everybody."

alcoholism,,Hi. My mother is an alcoholic. Once she starts drinking sheâ€™s almost unable to stop by herself. Since I was like 16 I used to watch her so she doesnâ€™t go and buy a drink and that was the only way she was able to stop. By now I have my own family and itâ€™s really difficult for me to stay there for 2 or 3 days until sheâ€™s totally sober and withdrawal symptoms are gone. But I am very scared to ignore it because I donâ€™t want something happen to her. She doesnâ€™t want to go to rehab. Any advice ?

I keep eating but it isnâ€™t helping. I just feel down and I keep thinking about this saying I saw a while ago. Your just borrowing happiness from tomarrow to numb tonight. Or something like that.

alcoholism,,"Anger/Drinking &amp; My Dilemma 
Husband and I have been together 4 years. 6 months ago he spiraled and got fired. Never happened before. He went into a suicidal depression and drinking all day/night. Found another job a month later so I thought things would get better. And they did for awhile. Except the drinking continued. The last 3 months have been a ball of misery. He drinks all day/night. Sometimes drinks throughout the night and canâ€™t go to work the next day because he feels sick. 

 3-4 times a week he starts fights with me and truly says the nastiest meanest shit and doesnâ€™t remember saying it the next day. Iâ€™ve tried ignoring it, staying positive, talking to him, crying, silent treatment, you name it so far I tried it. My kids (from previous relationship) are 16 &amp; 18. They stay away from him and always ask me about his drinking and anger. Very few times heâ€™s said things to them drunk. Iâ€™ve been asking him to get help, go talk or see someone and he says he knows he has a problem and needs to change, but wonâ€™t do anything. Now Iâ€™m at the point that I want him to move out, but we have stay @ home orders and he says heâ€™ll go to a friends house then says he wonâ€™t. I donâ€™t want my kids to feel this way anymore and Iâ€™m tired of fighting, the anger and the constant blame that itâ€™s all my fault. The house is mine for 10 years now. So he needs to leave. Iâ€™ve asked him to leave even for a few weeks to get his head straight and he wonâ€™t. 

His fam lives in another state and not sure what they could do.

alcoholism,,Todayâ€™s the first day Iâ€™m making today my first day alcohol free! Iâ€™m just concerned with the withdrawals Iâ€™ve been drinking 6 to 12 minis of vodka a day for the last 4 years and never quit. Iâ€™ve never detoxed before and concerned about doing it on my own.

 I'm 34 now, necrosis of the hip, rash over my chest that wont quit itching, teeth ruined, and lack of a social life. All because of alcohol, and my lack of self control. But, I learned to quit.
Alcohol ruined my life, killed my father, and ruined my relationship with the only family I have left. I cant even call what family I have left, just to say hi, or even for help. Worst thing is lack of trust from family.

alcoholism,,"Shit. I think I'm addicted. Been drinking Everclear mixed with random stuff for 2 weeks straight. Well, I fucked up. I've never been addicted to alcohol before this. Had a lot of crazy shit happen in my life and I've now been drinking Everclear mixed with whatever sweet drink I had on hand for 2 weeks straight. Had maybe a day off each time.

How bad are the withdrawals gonna be? I have some Clonazolam (a research chemical benzodiazapine) on hand that could help with withdrawal. I noticed tonight I was feeling extra cold, anxious, shaky, etc before I drank some.

Are there any tapering guides? Should I just drink a tiny bit just enough to not feel bad? I'm usually pretty commited and can control myself when tapering off something like this. I'm very stubborn and will usually just push through any withdrawals as I did with kratom (shout out to /r/quittingkratom)

This seems like a totally different beast though potentially.

Thanks everyone. Pretty scared over here, especially with the coronavirus situation. Want to get this over with as soon as possible and stop drinking.

It honestly could've been more than 2 weeks, time just kind of gets away from you when drinking. Note that I would only drink at night and usually would feel fine-ish during the day."
alcoholism,,"Are you physically addicted to alcohol if you donâ€™t get withdrawals Iâ€™ve(30M) been addicted to everything at some point. And every drug has normally a two week shitshow after you cold turkey. Iâ€™ve been drinking heavy since I was 13, 20-30 drinks a night. As in blackout wake up in your jeans with all the lights on with a half eaten STILL FROZEN tv dinner smeared all over yourself every morning. But I can be back to normal by 2 pm and go without with any consequence if I take a break except for sleeplessness and anxiety which is almost unnoticeable at this point. Is it a mental addiction, not in like say thc, until you cross that physical line (shakes,seizures,vomiting,hallucinations). And Iâ€™m not hear to argue the difference of alcohol and cannabis, Iâ€™m just saying I crave thc just as much as alcohol and the only difference is weight gain and a shitty morning."
alcoholism,,"Alcoholism. Be strong. Remember.... In this life sometimes we forget who we truly are. We turn into something we would have never expected but there is ALWAYS a way out, a way to succeed and a way to pull yourself back to that heartwarming, person that you lost. In my situation I LOVED to go out have fun with friends and drink. For others it could be something completely different. Some of us don't realize the things we are doing until something bad happens or you end up hurting your health. But it's never to late to help yourself and think what is more important in life. A future. A family. Support. Love. And much more. I have recently learned to put the partying behind me, put the drink down and enjoy the memories in the moment and the people whom you love and cherish because one day we all won't be here. Unfortunately it took me a while to actually process this because to me my priorities were not all there. But now I know my new chapter will be so much better. 
Thank you to all of those who have stood by me and loved me no matter what!
The journey begins and I want to enjoy all of it with all of you.

Im 25 year old male, with 80kg (about 160 pounds?). So i have this totally random blackouts and im going to describe it, so maybe people will relate and give me a tip or two.

Last few times i drank, i always got blackout drunk. Even if i have mindset i will just drink 1 cup of wine, i get fucking blackout drunk. I mean its not black and white like this, but for reference let me describe yesterday. I had dinner with my family. We were not like ""yeah, lets get drunk!"", it was dinner with some wine. I didnt want to drink, i didnt want to get drunk, but yeah i will drink a cup of wine with my family. And that is what i remember. I drank a cup of wine. But after that i dont remember any fucking thing. I dont know how much i drank, what we were talking, nothing. Even in the morning my parents told me that they dont know how i got drunk that fast since i didnt drink a lot. I even puked at the end. 

I assumed for a lot of my blackouts that it was because i had empty stomach, but that was not the case yesterday. I might mixed some alcohol. I mean i had like very small glass of strong alcohol (dont know how to say that type of alcohol in english) before dinner, for disinfection purposes (atleast we are joking like that in family, we dont get hammered with that shit).

I dont have drunk or middle phase last few times. I say there are 3 phases of drinking: sober, drunk, blackout. I'm not even drunk, just straight to blackout. 3 or 5 years ago i was drinking every weekend with my friends and this shit never happened, but now all the time.

So yeah if anyone can relate, please explain me wtf is going on."

When I came back from a few hours of walking around after not leaving the apartment for almost a week  he decided he didnâ€™t want me to go outside after I left and changed the locks.  When I came back, he didnâ€™t let me in and I eventually had to ask my sister if I could sleep on her couch.  I knew this has to end but it still hurts so bad.

The withdrawals are horrible.  I can't eat without puking.  I can't sleep for days at a time.  Nightmares.  I tried Benadryl last night and had horrific halucinations.  Auditory and closed eye.  

If I can get through tomorrow I can get vistirol prescribed for free.  Don't know how much it will help.  It did when I went to jail.  

I've kicked a couple times but this seems different.  I'm sick as fuck.  I'm laid off from my job and running out of money.  No idea what to do.  I'm actually quite surprised I am not suicidal like I have been in the past, but every other symptom is magnified by 10.

Hi all

New here and am 33 F. I have decided to stop drinking as I am very scared right now. Last weekend I drank 3 days straight. I am usually a wine drinker during the week but with this quarantine went overboard over those 3 days. I ended up going to the bathroom and had black stool. Ran to urgent care next morning and they said could be Gastritis or maybe ulcer. gave me some acid blockers. Havent drank since Tuesday afternoon. Black stool is gone but now I have yellow/light brown stool and is still making me nervous as I've gone down a Google rabbithole. Did anyone ever have any of these symptoms--i have no other symptoms really. Please I'm so scared. I am done with drinking."

But then when Iâ€™m not drinking I still want to do these things but I have zero motivation. But then when Iâ€™m drinking I donâ€™t wanna do them because â€œIâ€™m drinking right now and will do it soberâ€

One brother is financially stable, so I'm pushing for him to get his own place. One brother is a minor and I don't know what to do about him. 

I can't have her committed, my state doesn't allow involuntary. So the only recourse it seems is severing ties."
alcoholism,,"I need to stop drinking alone in my house It seems all anyone is doing during the lockdown is drinking. My friends are almost showing off waking up and starting to drink. I've used this as almost a licence to drink like a mad man. 

Yesterday my girlfriend and I joined a video call with our friends and just chatted shit while having a drink. She went to bed at about 9pm and asked me to go with her and I didn't. I wasn't done drinking despite the fact it was my third day on it and I'd been drinking since midday. 

She asks me not to drink all the alcohol in the house and I take this as some sort of challenge and I set out to drink all the alcohol in the house. I don't know how far I got and I'm too embarrassed to check. I think it was maybe half a box of wine, half a litre of rum and some ciders. Probably the most I've ever drank in my life. 

At some point I tried to make food and I somehow managed to slice my fingers up with a knife. It was sore but nothing serious. I was too drunk to dress the wound and my girlfriend came in to see what the noise was about and saw me bleeding quite heavily. I saw her and I just started crying. 

I can't moderate my drinking. My first drink I can nurse over an hour but as soon as I start to drink I have an indescribable urge to just drink constantly. Like I need the alcohol to be going down my throat. 

What if I needed stitches? Medical professionals have no time for drunks. If I had walked in pissing blood during a pandemic because I was too drunk to use a knife I would have died from shame. 

My girlfriend isn't angry with me. She just kind of accepts that this is what I do on a weekly basis. Get absolutely paralytic drunk until I fall asleep then spend the next day throwing up. It's 6pm here and I've only just sobered up from last night. 

I'm lying here and I get a notification from my bank telling me a payment has come out for a beer subscription service. Impeccable timing. 

I don't really have a question. I just wanted to write this down. I've told her I'm not drinking in the house by myself anymore but she doesn't believe me. It isn't the first time I've made that promise.

I wish I could have a glass of wine or a few beers but it's always, always more. When I get to a point I tell myself to go to bed and stop drinking but then I just ignore myself. I physically cannot stop once I start. It's so grim and depressing. 

I don't want to stop drinking entirely. I still want to do it in social settings, I don't have trouble then. When I'm with people I can moderate. I can only drink as fast as the slowest drinker and I want to stay somewhat sober so I can continue to have a conversation but when I'm alone I don't have to deal with any of that."
alcoholism,,"When is it a problem? Not a burner. Maybe it should be, but screw it.

My (34) SO(35) of 5 years drinks. Not every night. Sometimes once a week. Sometimes less. Sometimes more.

The problem is that I don't think she can put the brakes on it when she does. She becomes tempestuous, she can barely make coherent sentences, and she stumbles around. Then, we almost always get into a fight, but since she's so far gone, it's not a productive fight.

I've found myself altering my own behavior to keep us from getting in situations where we'd be drinking. I basically don't drink at all anymore, because I'm afraid it'll give her an excuse to drink. Whenever she says that's she's going to the liquor store, I feel a sense of dread and anxiety. If I see her crack a beer, I try to go to bed before she hits that incoherent stage. I count drinks. If it goes past 2, I peace out for the night.

We've talked a little about this when she's sobered up the next morning. She ends up feeling terrible and self conscious. It usually ends with her in tears and me feeling like a mega jerk. Sometimes she makes an effort to stop drinking for a while, but it never lasts.


I can't help ponder if I just anxiety about her drinking and I'm just making it out to be worse than it is. I know so many people who drink more, and a lot more frequently, so a part of me just thinks I'm the one with a problem. Is 4-6 drinks once or twice a problem? Am I the one being a jerk? I've never asked her to quit. I feel like that's not fair, but I have asked her to keep under control or I tell her to cool it now and again, but it seldom works.

I'm typing this out from my car, with nowhere to really go during this quarantine business. We just got into a fight... and I just couldn't handle it.

alcoholism,,"Get Sober on the beaches of Reddit Nation  

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the â€œkingâ€)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MREâ€™s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

alcoholism,,"Question for those with a DUI Hi, I recently got a DUI and with this virus I lost my job. I pleaded guilty at court, so I'm wondering if a DUI comes up as a red flag on a criminal background check and if I'll be denied jobs that don't even involve driving now because of it.
Anyone know? I live in California if that helps."
alcoholism,,"Is my boyfriend an alcoholic or am I overreacting? My boyfriend (30's) admits that he enjoys beer but denies that he has a problem. But I think he does. When we first started dating he would come over to my apartment and drink a six pack on a weekday after work. But when he does that he does not appear drunk. I have confronted him about it and he has slowed down (as far as I know I don't see him every day) but he gets angry when I talk about it. But still when he has a bad day at work he says ""I need a beer"" and goes home to drink beer, not just one, 2-4. In college he got a DUI but does not drive after having more than 1 drink. At a party at his friends house he said he wasn't going to drink because he had to work the next day.. he ended up getting so drunk that he fell multiple times while we were walking home and fell down the stairs in the middle of the night.. that next morning he didn't remember leaving the party. I almost broke up with him that night. I am 6 years younger than him and I don't act like that. When we go to weddings or parties he is usually the drunkest one there like he doesn't know when to stop drinking. His mom has came up to me before and said ""don't let him drink anymore"". There has been days where he drinks beer instead of eating dinner. We have been together for years and I love him but I'm embarrassed by his behavior. I'm not a big drinker at all so am I overreacting or does he have a problem? I can't see a future with someone who drinks so much that they're slowly killing themselves. Any advice would be great thank you!"

alcoholism,,I fee guilty Iâ€™ve been abusing for 18years straight. I was drinking close to 4 litres of rum a month and bit by bit getting worse and worse as the years rolled by.

At first it was hell I was itchy and irrational and sleep was impossible. Now though Iâ€™m starting to feel great and think I might be able to put this in my past. My problem though is I just feel so guilty that these are the circumstances that lead to my sobriety. It feels wrong to feel good from this when people are losing their life everyday due to this pandemic. I just feel super conflicted how can I enjoy this when it comes at the expense of the world?

iâ€™m 19 and i suffer heavily with ocd, particularly related to health. i have been drinking heavily on and off since I was 15. it was always just something i did. it is the only thing that takes my mind off the anxious thoughts (weed makes them worse). now its a serious problem.

as someone who is severely (and i mean severely) affected by hypochondria, i have been having an insane crisis since COVID began. i am terrified and i do not put that bluntly. for the past month iâ€™ve had visions of myself intubated or going into cardiac arrest. for the past month iâ€™ve been afraid of becoming a news story for fear porn and that being my legacy. i was able to stay off booze for the beginning, but since then, Iâ€™ve been on an 8 day bender.

i didnâ€™t think this could actually happen, but all day iâ€™ve been feeling lightheaded and having pains all over. this made me panic and i came on here earlier and saw that it may be symptomatic of alcohol withdrawals, and what do you know, it was. i took a few drinks and they werenâ€™t there anymore. i donâ€™t even feel drunk right now, i feel fucking normal. this is scary to me. i literally have developed a physical dependency as a result of me binging for a week to assuage my fears. iâ€™m really ashamed of myself. i donâ€™t want to do this to myself at this young age.

at the moment i feel trapped. itâ€™s like, drinking is the only thing that helps with my OCD NORMALLY, and it feels like the whole world is in a thought loop so i did this. i wanna get out of this. i wanna stop drinking for good. this fucking stupid liquid has fucked up my relationships, friendships, career opportunities, made me overweight, etc. and now Iâ€™ve drank so much in so little time that my body doesnâ€™t want me to stop. please help me get out of this shithole, guys. i donâ€™t want this to be what defines me"

Like I am bipolar2 and I think Iâ€™m just spiraling right now and like itâ€™s not like this all the time I think.

alcoholism,,"I'm 23 years old and don't know how to get help due to the COVID-19 pandemic Around 3\\4 years ago, I slipped in to deep depression after the death of a number of many people I loved within a short period of time. This resulted in my recreational use of drugs turning in to serious addiction, which resulted in me being hospitalized twice from use of ketamine.

Since then I have made substantial recovery, mentally, physically, socially (regained a lot friends), and also my career is going extremely well. However, a few months back I realized that I had replaced my usual addictive habits for alcohol.

I always drank in excess, but when consuming benzo's, ketamine and other substances in excess daily, alcohol did not cross my mind as being a part of the problem.

I now realize although I have made a lot of progress, my relationship with alcohol is extremely unhealthy. I think in the past 2 years I have maybe not drank 20 days in total. I regularly drink alcohol in the day, I have regularly felt the need to drink alcohol to elevate a hangover, and in trying to quit alcohol thinking that I could easily I have faced physical and psychological symptoms (sweats, shaking, depression, sickness, unable to sleep etc) which has always resulted in me buying more alcohol and feeling very guilty about it. (I have spent thousands of pounds on the stuff over the years)

I spoke to a doctor to arrange sessions in the hope to get a prescription for antabuse, but now that the recent virus outbreak has occurred I don't think that it is possible.

I don't know what to do, I feel stupid saying it but I can't stop. I really want to stop drinking, I wish it never fucking existed, but I can't stop. I'm functioning and I am doing well (self employed &amp; in university).. but I know deep down I am killing myself.

The fact is, if I keep drinking as much as I do now for the next 20 years, I will be extremely lucky to live past 50.

What do I do? I would really appreciate any advice."

alcoholism,,"Stopped drinking for 2 days, it screwed me up. I can't find anything anywhere online that's been genuinely helpful, so I'm posting here in hope that someone who has been through the same thing can help me. Because I have no idea why this is happening all of the sudden. So here's my story. 

I'm 33 years old, and I've been a pretty consistent drinker for a long time. I only drink beer nowadays because liquor is too much for me, and I was getting out of hand. So for the past year or two it's just been beer. I drink between 3-6 beers daily and sometimes a few more on the weekend. Mostly 16oz coors lite, and the occasional IPA. Typically I don't start drinking till around 5 or 6 PM and have the occasional off day on the weekend when I drink a little too much the night before. Well this past weekend I did just that. I went a little hard on Friday, and decided not to drink Saturday to give myself some recovery. Everything going normal as usual, spend the day laying around relaxing. Then Sunday rolls around, and about half way through the day, hours before I typically start drinking I start feeling kinda crappy. I think maybe I'm coming down with something, and maybe I'm just dehydrated. So I decide I probably shouldn't drink. Then half way through Sunday night the shakes start, and I wonder if I'm having an alcohol withdrawal. I have one beer left in my fridge and it's too late to go buy more. I drink the one beer and feel slightly better for about 30 mins and then right back to feeling sick, realizing that I am in fact withdrawaling. I decide to try and sleep it off and go to bed. I sleep great and wake up Monday feeling energetic but notice the shaking is still happening, and I'm having some trouble focusing. It continues to get worse as the day goes on and around 5 or 6 pm I decide to go get more beer to try and feel better. I get home and drink about 4 beers and I feel normal as can be and go to bed. Fast forward to 4am and my eyes shoot open and I'm wide awake. I toss and turn till 8am when I finally get up because I can't sleep. The sweating and shaking sets in again and worsen though out the day. I'm starting to worry at this point. 6pm rolls around and I feel horrible. I decide it's probably safer to drink than not at this point and just try and taper off over time after reading about alcohol withdrawal online. So I drink, everything feels better again except I'm exhausted from getting no sleep and feeling horrible all day. Cut to Wednesday and here I am, only slept about 5 hours before I started to withdrawal again, it's happening faster and I'm now considering going to the ER. Terrified because I have no health insurance and am out of a job currently because of Covid. I have no idea why my body is detoxing so quick and sending me into a withdrawal after 6 or 7 hours of not drinking. I used to go at least 14 hours or more with no booze and never had an issue. I don't think tapering is going to work at this point. All because I took an extra day off of drinking I feel I can't go back."
alcoholism,,"I love drinking, but I always hate myself afterwards I could use some help. I don't drink heavily every day, most days I don't even drink. But sometimes, when I have a drink, I just can't stop. I'll chug it so fast, and then just run to get another. Last night I did that again. I think I had 2 ciders and maybe a quarter of a handle of rum, maybe a bit more. I was by myself, not doing anything exciting. 

I just don't know how to stop after 1 or 2. It's like once I start, I'm just never satiated. And now, when I hit the morning after, I just hate myself because I know I'm just abusing it. Before I turned 21 I would only drink socially, but now that I'm of age, I can tell that I'm just slowly drinking more and more, and leading down to a path of alcoholism. 

How can I control myself better when I do have a drink?"
alcoholism,,"Advice on How to Quit Alcohol in South Korea? Hey everyone, I'm an American living in SK right now and I really need some advice on how to stop drinking. As it is right now I am drinking about 675-740 ml of Soju (20%) every night. Before moving to Korea I was just drinking enough cheap whiskey to make the room spin and knock me out for sleep. Ive been drunk every single night for about two years straight and I'm sick of how it is affecting my social life, work life, and my enjoyment. I've tried to cut back on drinking on my own countless times, but I've failed every time and only make it a few days before I'm drinking like I used to. I really need help on what to do if anybody can offer some advice. 

 For the past three months it feels like alcohol has been making things harder and harder for me. I have been canceling plans to go out in the evening because I start to seriously zone out and get anxious around 5:00 pm about being away from alcohol. I've had this constant brain fog for the past few months that only leaves me for maybe two hours a day. It feels like I'm not even fully conscious because it's so heavy and doesn't let me really enter reality. It sounds stupid, but its like there's this wall between me and other people that has appeared and I'm experiencing everything second hand. I get extremely tired to the point that my last two hours of work (I'm a teacher and right now we have a few more weeks before students come back because of COVID-19) are just me staring at my computer trying not to fall asleep. I've been getting headaches and chest tightness that doesn't go away until I start drinking again. At the same time my chest is tightening my heart just beats and beats and beats, but it all dissapears when I drink. 

Today I was going to visit a hospital to see about detox or medicine according to what I needed, but the friend who was going to bring me ended up saying it wasn't a good idea to go to the hospital. He is a coworker of mine who I trust, and his concern was that if I went to the hospital for a long time I may get the coronavirus and then bring it back to school for when the students come back. That would be horrible for the school's image and we would probably lose a lot of students from their parents pulling them out. I understood his point, but the virus will be here for a long time yet, and I desperately need to get my alcohol problem solved before my students come back. I can't keep pushing back the date on solving this because it is going to affect my classes too much. Every morning I'm hungover, and by 6:00pm I am a zombie. I'll be teaching kids from 9:00-6:00 every day during the times where I'm still partially drunk or craving alcohol.

I'm sorry if this isn't all very well explained. If anybody has any suggestions they can give me on how to handle this in a foreign country, I would seriously appreciate it."

In February I went to hospital and was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis from alcohol abuse. I was drinking about 20 units or more a day for about 4 years, and now I canâ€™t drink without risking my life. The problem I have is that while I know it caused so many problems for me (ultimately cutting my life short and putting me in a lot of pain) I am still in love with it. I would never have stopped drinking unless I was forced to. Iâ€™ve never been interested in getting better, and I unfortunately have managed to romanticised self destruction so much that I donâ€™t want to get better. I can recognise that itâ€™s just addiction but I still canâ€™t stop wanting it. I donâ€™t want to be sober but I will be, but itâ€™s torture seeing alcohol and just wishing that I could still drink. 

I donâ€™t like being sober. I just straight up donâ€™t like the mental state and I donâ€™t think I ever will. But Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a way for me to see sobriety as a good thing. How? Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m being miserable but I miss booze so bad. I want the chaos of it all, I donâ€™t like being in control. I want to be able to be happy sober.

alcoholism,,"Cirrhosis - Ammonia levels - Body temperature (Background--Dad has end stage liver disease. He's had TIPS procedure, and prior to that had multiple large volume paracentesis procedures. Encephalopathy has been on and off. He does sleep 12-16 hours a day probably. Slurred speech when he wakes up, and before he dozes off.)



My dad had a fall from disorientation. He stupidly wasn't taking enough meds to lower his ammonia, bc it made him use the bathroom all the time--duh. So he reduced it, fell over in the bathroom, and we found him after I don't know how long...

He's in the hospital now. When he arrived they said his ammonia levels were at 61. 2 days later they are at 106. 
What ammonia level are they referring to? They said 61 was ""elevated,"" But now 106 is pretty high I'm guessing if 61 was just elevated...

His body temperature is at 93. They had trouble getting an accurate reading, and finally did it rectally. I'm assuming this low body temperature is a pretty bad sign? I know the liver helps regulate it...

Can anyone speak to similar circumstances? I'm at his house alone trying to clean things up.. but it's bad. You can tell he's given up, and has been very disoriented..."

My last attempt at sobriety was Sept 2019, had a good month and then convinced myself I wasn't an alcoholic, I just had bad drinking habits.  My decision to break sobriety was calculated, not done in a moment of weakness, I went to a bar and had just one, went home and went to bed.  ""Ah-Ha! Obviously I'm not an alcoholic because an alcoholic can't have just one""...  You know the story, things progressed, my ""bad habits"" returned.

Iâ€™m REALLY struggling with my addiction right now. I had a year sober and relapsed a month ago. This past month Iâ€™ve been drinking on and off. 

I got kicked out of my sober house and moved in with my mom last week. She lives in the middle of nowhere so thereâ€™s no liquor stores within walking distance, and she took my keys so I couldnâ€™t drive anywhere. So I had alcohol delivered. It was just gonna be once, but a couple days later I did it again. 

This morning she busted me (my room smelled like alcohol). I had been lying all week pretending to be serious about getting sober. I even started outpatient today. Iâ€™m struggling so bad... I want to be sober again, I really do!! But I want to order more alcohol so badly right now. 

Of course, she now took my ID, so Iâ€™d have to be even more sneaky. Iâ€™d either have to steal my ID back or try to order it in my brotherâ€™s name and use his old one downstairs. My brain is going crazy trying to come up with ideas on how to make this work.

alcoholism,,"Need an accountability buddy for the next few weeks Hey folks,

I'm in need of an accountability buddy for the next few weeks - a temporary sponsor, if you will. Here's a brief history for ya:

I am 28 year old male and recently moved out of my dad's house who is also alcoholic after living with him for the last 2 years. I moved there (and this is going to sound crazy) right after 4 months of rehab (1 IP, 3 IOP). I intended to try a method of tapering off alcohol using Naltrexone. As you probably guessed, I didn't get the results I was hoping for. I must say it, did prevent me from sinking to the depths I had gone to before treatment but I was still drinking at way unhealthy levels (think like 8-10 drinks on the worst days throughout this last year vs 12-14 on any given weekend back in 2017). 
About a month ago, I was getting frustrated with not being able to live up to my potential, not getting things done, putting off schoolwork etc. I was just stagnating and I couldn't find the will to really change anything. It was just to easy to put it off, weeks become months, you know how it is. 
Fortunately, my aunt offered to let me stay with her so I can get back on track without too much pressure. So for this last month I've been drinking between 3-6 beers a day, that is, up until Sunday. On Monday I started tapering off and it's been going just fine (still taking Naltrexone as I ought). Tonight I had 2. Tomorrow is 1 and then Friday is 0. 

The place I'm in is very supportive and I'm not really worried about going on a bender or anything. I mostly just want someone I can tell, ""Hey, I did good today."" other than my aunt or my cousin who's home from college because of Covid-19. 

Thanks"
alcoholism,,"Boyfriend is an alcoholic, need advice I'm really sorry if this is not the appropriate place. My boyfriend of several years is an alcoholic and has struggled with it off and on for years. He managed about a year of sobriety but has gone back to drinking. I have had to move in with him during lockdown because I was forced out of my university home and cannot live with my parents. He was very adamant that I don't enter the kitchen earlier and as I was sleeping/newly awake it didn't really click. I've just found a 4 pack of beer that is definitely alcoholic. In this place there is no way to get space from each other and I really don't want him sneaking around with it as he gets nasty. I'm wondering if I should bring it up with him and say given the circumstances I'd rather he drink and at least be honest about it so it can be limited and cause less problems in regards to dishonesty or should I just confront him about it and say it's not on even though it's his home? 

I can't travel for at least a few weeks to my parents and am still worried about doing so as one of them is at risk so very lost and worried rn"

Heâ€™s caught me drinking/ hiding my drinking multiple times now. I keep trying to do better &amp; be honest, but I feel so much shame that I also try and take care of it by myself (by hiding it) with no success.

alcoholism,,"My best and only friend is an alcoholic and vanishes half the time into binge drinking sprees. I thought Iâ€™d post here since you guys will understand what I am talking about.

I have one friend in my life who is actually my best friend. The biggest issue that I have is that when he gets drunk, which happens every other week, heâ€™ll disappear for 1-2 weeks. There have been times where I really needed his emotional support when moving to different cities, or when I got injured, and I couldnâ€™t reach him because he was drunk. I know he doesnâ€™t do this intentionally and I know I canâ€™t make him change, but I just wanted to express my feelings.

We have really good times together when he is sober even though sometimes he gets angry and lashes out quickly. I just wish he were more consistent and reliable.

alcoholism,,"Detoxing without health insurance Iâ€™m sure many of you will respect my inability, currently, to accept the title of â€œalcoholicâ€ at this current time. Not that I donâ€™t think that I am because Iâ€™m not that naive to the fact. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m uncomfortable with know that I am itâ€™s others knowing I am. Regardless itâ€™s a â€œjourneyâ€ we all have to take and in due time Iâ€™m positive Iâ€™ll confront in due time. 

My question is, that I know will be difficult to answer, does anyone have any advice for going through withdrawal without insurance. I know the instant response is to go to hospital and go that way but itâ€™s not always an option. I donâ€™t think I would go through seizures, I know everyone says that even those who do have seizures, but I donâ€™t think I would. BUT Iâ€™m not naive to the possibility of this happening. Iâ€™ve been a heavy drinker for a year and a half now. 6-8 drinks for five days a week and I know the risks. If one were to, and I know itâ€™s not advised, detox without medical care because of lack of insurance what would be recommended to the best of ones knowledge. Hospital is just not possible so please donâ€™t say go because itâ€™s not possible. Access to Benzos are. I know the dosage recommended for my weight. I know this is a hard question and I hope I didnâ€™t violate any rules for this subreddit but this is the reality for many of us who have this problem. All responses encouraged. Thanks so much."

Today he had his first relapse since he stopped drinking, he was sober for 2.5 years. His brother died today, it wasnâ€™t unexpected because he was battling with cancer, which got worse this month. My stepdad left the house this afternoon and return minutes ago, drunk.

I'm not staying with my parents during the quarantine, but I'm few blocks away their house. My mom wrote to told me, and she said my step dad didn't want me to know. I can't go to their house right now because in my country we are on a night-time curfew. The thing is, this situation puts me (and also my mom) under extreme anxiety, because I canâ€™t avoid remembering those hard times when he was a regular drinker.

Her mother died last year and this didnâ€™t happen. I think is important to talk with him tomorrow, but I don't have the emotional tools to do it. What to say or to do avoiding being cruel (which was my kind of shield when he was drinking too much). I want to offer my support instead to turn my back. How can I deal with this?"
alcoholism,,I picked a hell of a time to quit drinking. Right before the New Great Depression.
alcoholism,,"Emotional flatness after quitting drinking For the past 8 days, I have been completely sober for the first time in probably 3 years. I quit alcohol and weed the same day and overall I feel good and have resisted any urges to relapse but in that span of time I have been unable to sleep and since day 3 or so of sobriety I have felt little to no emotions. I have a history of somewhat major depression and bipolar (part of why I drank), but since quitting I have felt emotionally blunted at best, at times even completely numb and emotionless. Is this normal? Is this good? Is this bad? Iâ€™m 20 years old btw."

alcoholism,,"I relapsed yesterday.... My first â€œrealâ€ sober date (first time I stopped with the right attitude) was Nov 22, and yesterday, for the 3rd time since, I slipped up and had a couple of beers. Just like the last few times, it ended with few beers, a lot of disappointment with myself, a huge amount of reflection on the cause of the trigger, and started again the next day with a new attitude. 

The problem is my girlfriend, who has been incredibly supportive, has taken this particular mistake particularly hard. I really canâ€™t blame her; Iâ€™ve not kept my word about it many times over the past couple of years but have been on a good program since November. The past few times Iâ€™ve slipped, Iâ€™ve been able to stay positive and focused, forgive myself, and move on with a new understanding of my sobriety the next day. 

This time though, it feels like while Im able to forgive myself, it seems like sheâ€™s struggling to forgive me. The past relapses, sheâ€™s had the same attitude as me; â€œok it happened. Learn from it and move forward.â€  This was incredibly helpful. Her reaction this time is killing me and putting me in a very dark anxious place that I used to block out by drinking. Not her fault, but Iâ€™m struggling to move forward with a positive attitude this time around.

alcoholism,,"Alcohol Humour I used to use humour to make my drinking seem funny, i.e. okay.

""You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.""

Found that one in my Facebook Memories section today from 8 years ago.

Nowadays I look back at those old Facebook statuses and smh. I think of how dysfunctional I was. I had a partner at the time, but used to make excuses not to spend time with him, because he wasn't a heavy drinker, and I wanted to spend my evenings drinking. When I got together with my work friends, it always involved alcohol and my hot tub. 

I used to black out almost every time I drank. I often fell and injured myself. I would do things, irrational things, that I couldn't recall the following day. But the evidence was around me: a hole in the wall, a broken curtain rod.

Yet, if I couldn't spend the evenings after work with a buzz, I wasn't able to function. 

Illogical, considering I wasn't functioning while I was drinking?

Yes.

But that is the nature of the beast."

Starting with Ritalin when I was 6. (Early90's I'm 36)

 Between the age of 12 and now I have done everything under the sun.
I'm a felon for DUIs, been to prison,  been to rehab
 barely have held a drivers license.
I've been in and out of jail for various things.

I was in prison when my daughter was born back in 2015.
I vowed to myself that I would make myself a better person. Since then I've made my way into a really good middle management position.( I have a great work ethic)
Although my partying and drug use slowed down, my alcoholism took the fast track.

Went to catholic school where friends parents drank also, but I knew not to do shit. Drank like twice after being 18 and then was straight edge because of the hardcore punk scene I was in. 22 (2013) was dating a dude and started smoking weed and drank occasionally. Not the most social and went out with friends in late 2016. Drank more than I should irished goodbyed and yeah. Hit a metal pole and came as close to death as I have. So glad I didnâ€™t hurt anyone else, but broke a lot in me. In the icu for almost a week.

I'm a basically a nihilist and a sociopath. Well a more controlled sociopath because I don't have anger issues. However, caring for people and things in general is just absolutely foreign. Other than entertainment, life has no point. With that in mind, drugs and alcohol are a go-to with alcohol being the default due to accessibility. 

I'll get sober and healthy every once in awhile and just get bored and go back to being drunk. Suicide is a constant option because, well, why not? Im getting older, alcohol is giving me worse hangovers, and I've done all I want to do. I'm just baffled how people don't want to drink and actually continue living life half the time."
alcoholism,,"Not an every day drinker, but probably nearly half the days drinker Like the title says, I don't drink every single night or the occasional day, but whenever my schedule is open on the next day, I  will hit 8-12 drinks usually beer 3-4 nights a week since I work from home most of the time. There was a good stretch of a few months about 9-14 months ago when I didn't drink much, but since then it's been trying to not drink so much but ending up drinking around 20 drinks a week a more. It's cut down some since I don't meet my friends with whom I used to drink a lot due to the quarantine, but I still enjoy how drinking feels when I'm at home playing games or about to eat dinner. I feel like I always do the same shit, drink till I get drunk enough to not care about what I will eat then order an unhealthy pile of food to devour causing me to have to drink so much water I am waking up every 2 hours to drink and pee until it's early morning and I won't be able to sleep again for at least several hours. I drink coffee thinking it helps prevent liver damage and sometimes wallow in despair that I have ruined my body and mind from drinking so much. The depressing thoughts that I have drank away my potential and my health hit especially hard after that 2 or 3rd day of drinking straight with a foggy mind. I obtain supplements like DHM and sylmarin to prevent the damage I have certainly done to my liver, knowing there is no repairing the body from drinking this much. I feel my healthfulness starting to return after that day of abstinence and then letting myself believe my throat and stomach are fine after 2 days of rest. Forgetting that hope to abstain for at least 2 weeks, because I heard 2 weeks is enough time for the liver to fix itself usually. I'm 35 now and I've wanted to control my drinking since I was 27. From 22-27, I drank whenever I could as much as I wanted. From 20-22, I drank nearly every single night about .375 of hard liquor.

Even though I never have more than a few beers, I have noticed that lately Iâ€™ve been wanting one more and more. I live by myself, and while in some ways social distancing has been easier for me than it is for a lot of people, I think the stress of the pandemic has been getting to me. Before this, I occasionally drank socially and every once in a while would have a beer on my own. Now Iâ€™ve discovered that there are ways to get beer delivered along with food - like I can order a six pack from a restaurant and have it delivered with my meal, even though I wouldnâ€™t drink all of it at once. Also a local liquor store is doing delivery. I started by getting some wine with my first meal, then it was a six pack which lasted me less than a week. I recently ordered another five tall boys from the liquor store. I keep checking for updates on which new restaurants are delivering beer, and think about having one more and more - I drank one of the tall boys at 10:30 this morning to stave off anxiety about the lack of work coming my way (Iâ€™m a freelancer). I keep thinking about going in for that last one in the fridge and stopping myself. Am I just self medicating to cope with a stressful time, or is this how alcoholism starts?"
alcoholism,,"Librium, seroquel, and gabapentin to withdraw I recently had a bender for about a week. Started slow and progressed to killing half a handle and 6-12 beers a day. Decided I was done after my taper with beer didnâ€™t work. I called my psychiatrist who prescribes me klonopin (I have anxiety and use 1mg as needed). 
Well, he put me on Librium to ward off seizures. Gabapentin for anxiety. Seroquel for sleep. 

The Librium didnâ€™t help my withdraw the first night. I still felt like I would seize any moment. No outward shakes but inward, if that makes sense. Anxiety was awful and I couldnâ€™t sleep. Decided to take another because my first dose was only one and it says one-two per dose. Finally I fell asleep around 3am after taking them at 9:30 and 10:30. I woke up, took another Librium and started the gabapentin at a small dose. That night I took half a seroquel and it knocked me out. I woke up talking to my husband about how I needed to put a package into the mailbox, and some other weird shit. I was slurring my words and it made my husband worried. I woke up groggy. Had thoughts like â€œI just want to dieâ€ and I was easy to snap on my husband. I then slept all day long. 
Iâ€™ve withdrawn from alcohol before with klonopin. I would have this time without telling my doc but I was 5 days shy of my next script. 

Just to be clear- this virus has had me in a panic. We have a 6 week old newborn. I worry about her and I canâ€™t stand that we canâ€™t leave the house. I stopped taking my klonopin when I was drinking but I did take it in the mornings in a higher dose when I started to get â€œthe fearâ€. 

I fucked up. I binged again. I donâ€™t want it to happen again and I honestly believe it wonâ€™t after this hellacious experience. All of these medications combined as left me as a shell of a person. I have no joy, no sadness. Iâ€™m just sitting here staring out the window. 

My psychiatrist didnâ€™t call me back today due to it being a holiday. I canâ€™t see him on FaceTime until tomorrow afternoon. 

What do I do? Do I stop the meds all together and drink small amounts? I canâ€™t take the gaba or seroquel anymore, I refuse. But I donâ€™t know much about Librium. Can I take it as directed and drink a beer or two? My doctor said to avoid alcohol or it will be a â€œWhitney Houstonâ€. Iâ€™ve mixed Benzos and alcohol before, which Iâ€™m not
proud of. But will this help me until he HOPEFULLY prescribes me klonopin again? 

I fucked up. I need someone to explain all of these medications and tell me everythingâ€™s going to be okay. 

Btw my husband has been very good about taking care of my daughter during this. He doesnâ€™t drink and is the best husband and father there is. He supports me and takes care of me but there is only so much he can do. I feel awful so please donâ€™t make me feel worse. 

Also- I know you guys arenâ€™t doctors. I just need advice about these meds and alcohol.

EDIT- I donâ€™t abuse my klonopin when I take it for anxiety. It actually helped me stop drinking in the past, and I hate to blame this on the virus but COVID has me really on edge and I started drinking again."

alcoholism,,"Broken priorities This is extremely difficult to post, as Ive never been able to admit that I drink too much, but I need help.  I have two young children, and my wife is not necessarily an active participant in their upbringing.  For example, my 6 year old asked her if she wanted to go lay in the bed upstairs because she's always laying down looking at her phone.  Additionally, when I have been able to not drink for an 'extended period' of time, there is minimal recognition from her part (not that she owes me that), so I fall right back into drinking to control my stress and anxiety, but, I need to take responsibility for my situation and not throw blame on her.  Through the years, I began to lean on liquor to calm my nerves, but I don't want to do that anymore.  I completely understand that wanting to be the best dad cannot live in tandem with excessive drinking, but I still cannot stop.  It breaks my heart when my kids ask for their mama, but she is emotionally unavailable, and I dont want them to look at me with that same level of disappointment.

I am just interested in seeing who else was in this position, and how you climbed out of it.  My kids should be enough motivation to quit drinking, altogether, but, for some reason, its not.  Im sure my perception of the issues is clouded, so I am more than open to a good ass-kicking.  Any help is deeply appreciated, and I hope everybody is enjoying their Sunday."

alcoholism,,"My mom is not likely to make it through the next few days. I apologize in advance if this is the wrong sub. Its just been a very rough weekend... 

My mom has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. Over the years she's driven away friends and even family. As her son, I always tried to keep communication channels as open as possible but over the years with the issues going on we've been speaking less and less (due to my own fault)

Friday night I received a call that my mom was in the hospital for a myriad of issues. I went to go see her, but could only temporarily be with her due to the current situation with coronavirus. The nurse and doctor told me that given her previous history with her drinking, that this will likely be the last time I see her alive (Due to COVID19 cant come visit daily, stay by her bedside etc otherwise I would be there right now). I held her hand and told her how much I loved her and im waiting for her to get better. Then we'll go home together and i'll take care of her. She's unresponsive and I ended up just crying for the hour talking to her. The doctors told me that she was found passed out laying on the ground somewhere after several hours. 

In the past i've dumped out her alchohol and she's kicked me out of the house. Other times I voice my opinion on how I want her to stop drinking and get better and shed reply ""fuck you, your not my son"". This battle constantly occurred. The last time I was with my mom was her birthday, she was slightly intoxicated and I took her to red lobster. For 30 minutes she spoke how she needs the money if I were to die. To not include my sisters or dad in the will, only include her. After that I didnt text her that much... This past decade her drinking has become worse and worse. I've had to drive to bars to find her laying her on the ground and carry her home on several occasions. I tried hard for my mom to get her better and hope for her to lessen her drinking. She's been in and out of rehabs with no success.

If I only had been more assertive in this situation I could have helped her more. I tried but I didnt try hard enough, I'm the only one in the family who cares about her and I let her down. I should have had her live with me. Over the past few years after she divorced my dad she had basically been living boyfriend to boyfriend.

The worst part is that my mom tried to call me 4 days before she was in the hospital. I had saw the call and figured i'd give her a call back later but I just got caught up with work and other aspects of life. I dont think I'll ever forgive my self for not returning that phone call. All I had to was give her a call and offer to bring her to my place for a bit to catch up. We wouldnt be where were at right now if I had just made that call and said that...

It's also affecting me how little any of the family cares. Her exhusband didnt care at all and said it was only a matter of time. My older sister said that she also mentally prepared for this many years and only feels anger and spite against our mom... Then I was told 5 days ago that my younger sister had answered my moms phone call but replied back with stating that she never wanted to talk to her again and hung up.... My mom tried to call me one day after that but I didnt pick up. She has depressive tendencies and I could only imagine what she was feeling. I failed my mother in not returning that phone call, I failed her by not being a better son and being more assertive. I should have been a better communicator and spent time with her even if the times I visited over the years were rough. I feel such guilt that I havent talked to her in months. I was a bad son. I hope she miracously recovers and I can just take her back to my house and take care of her. I wish she didnt drink so much over the years.. shes not even 50... I love you mom and i'll always will, im so sorry."

alcoholism,,"Advice for the daughter of an alcoholic father How to deal with abusive alcoholic father

Hi, so I (22F) really have never written about this and rarely talk about it. Basically, my father has been an alcoholic for ~17 years. After 2 duis, he finally went to rehab last year, and was doing fine, or so we thought. 

Background: He has anger management issues, rage, and I am pretty sure depression. He has been violent with my mom, my siblings, and me in the past. He doesnâ€™t eat healthy, doesnâ€™t exercise, and spends 12+ hours a day on his computer. He is actually one of the smartest people I know, which is what makes me so upset by this. My extended family act like they care about us, but they donâ€™t at all. They are very wealthy and we are well off, but we arenâ€™t as wealthy as them and thus they treat us like shit. They also hate my mother for no reason. My father has also called me a failure many times, even though I know that I very much am not. 

Yesterday, in a fit of rage, my father cut his left wrist in front of us. We called the paramedics and he is currently in a hospital. Alcohol had been found in his system. I thought he had been sober for one year. I also think my father does this for attention ie he wants us all to dope over him and tell him that without him we would be nothing, we love him, he hasnâ€™t done anything wrong, we will always be there for him, and just shit like that. He wants us to pay more attention to him and just like ?? I donâ€™t even know. But how long can we take this abuse? 

My question is that for some reason, I blame myself and I feel guilty for not trying to help him and trying not to care. I have cared for so many years, and I cry all the time from this. I donâ€™t know how to stop feeling guilty for not caring. EDIT- I am planning on getting therapy after the social distancing/covid19 lockdown ends. I just donâ€™t know what to do now that he is depressed suicidal alcoholic and abusive. I think my parents will get a divorce, and we are reliant on him to pay my tuition. I just feel very depressed sad guilty angry and just confused. This seriously messes with my brain and with this lockdown, I canâ€™t even go back to my apartment (I am at my best away from family)

Another thing is that I also get very very angry about the past, and the present. I get angry because my father is depressed due to neglect from extended family members, I feel guilty because I feel like I am not good enough, and I feel like I am a failure. When I get angry, I get delirious and I break things. This only happens inside my house and has never happened outside of it. Only happens in front of my family. Could this be due to childhood trauma? 

How do I cope with the fact that I feel the shame of my fatherâ€™s actions and my father feels no shame for his actions at all. He justifies his behavior because he had a hard life growing up, was poor, and now he has worked super hard to get where he is and we should be eternally grateful and we arenâ€™t. (His words) He just will manipulate us and make especially me feel guilty about all of this. In the past he has said that I am the reason he drinks and if I was good enough he would not and says stuff like this to my mother as well. 

After this incident last night, my aunt, who doesnâ€™t speak to my family called us and told us that my parents need to get a divorce, they blame my mother for my dads alcoholic actions. I believe the real reason he is depressed is because my dads extended family has never accepted us and they never will (rich vs middle class). They donâ€™t care about us, and this makes me feel bad about myself.

I just donâ€™t know how to make myself not care. I want to run away and cut everyone out of my life, but I need to finish my undergrad degree. I donâ€™t know how I will make it. I was gone for an entire year (2018) and backpacked Europe, but then I had to come back. I have 2 years of undergrad left, tuition free, and that is the only thing that is keeping me here. My mental health is taking a large toll, and I know what I have to do, but I get very sad and angry about all of this.

Any advice is welcome. I just need kind words and encouragement I donâ€™t know how to deal with this and I just keep blaming myself."

alcoholism,,"Long-time alcoholic with a question I've been a heavy drinking alcoholic for the better part of 15 years. There have only been two things in those years that have been able to keep me from getting blacked out wasted daily, the gym (former bodybuilder) and work. 4 years ago my brain surgery killed my bodybuilding dream and goals, emptied my bank account and put me in a bad spot. I quit the gym but still had work which at least kept me from drinking to the point of not being able to perform the next day,  24 beers a night for the most part but a few times I was able to get myself down to 12 or even 6 but for a short period. I started lifting again recently and had an intense work schedule which kept me near six beers a night for a couple months and then here comes covid. No gym and no work... A few years ago I started to get some yellow in my eyes and fingers on occasion, a few  weeks ago underneath my nail, my fingertips have turned red starting a few weeks ago.

 as of a few days ago, It's really hard to get past drink 3 (yet I'm still managing 12 +) drinking is causing some pretty extreme nausea. Is this potentially coming from further liver damage? You'd think this would be my sign but on I push"
alcoholism,,"DT's or Panic/anxiety Attack So let me provide some context:

I have been drinking for a long period of time now. About 4 years of heavy consumption, strictly at night in order to help my sleep. 

Recently (1 week ago) i experienced a pretty severe anxiety attack.
After which, I have consistently been getting anxiety.

Now during this i have kept my drinking habits the same. Havent quit, i know probably bad for my anxiety attacks.

Every morning since i wake up with an intense panic attack, followed by a day of anxiety until the last hours of the night.

Upon looking up the symptoms of DTs i found them to be very similar to my panic and anxiety disorders:


-Feeling of dread and death

-Intense shaking (legs and arms)

-Doubting whether or not what i heard was actually there

-Panic that is unable to shake and without clear causation.

-Dissocation

-Weird sensation of instant panic when attempting to fall back asleep

-unable to consistently eat 


Now when i rationalize eveything, it doesnt make sense that it would be DT's. I have not quit drinking and i have a relatively coherent stream of thought. 
Also, the intense
However, the shaking and dissociation, coupled with the uncertainty of noises around me has me on edge. My worry is that somehow my body is not metabolizing the alcohol in the way it had previously

My guess is that im currently panicking after looking up DT's symptoms, but due to the severity wanted a second opinion (i understand this is not professional medical advice, but curious if other have experienced anything similar)"

After having a couple of drunken angry meltdowns within a few days of each other I decided to stop drinking. For the first couple days I only had a few drinks a day and generally felt fine. Yesterday I didn't drink at all and I still felt fine (although depressed, bored, and anxious). Today I felt fine until this afternoon when my hands started to get shaky. I started to feel really out of it and went to the store (to buy beer -- NOT vodka). Everything felt so surreal like I was in a dream. I almost felt like I didn't recognize my surroundings.

I don't know if this is something to be concerned about because I didn't think that I drank enough to have problems stopping. Maybe this is just normal withdrawals? It was totally unexpected since I felt fine the past couple of days but I looked it up and apparently DTs don't start until a few days after you stop drinking."

alcoholism,,"Where to go from here Hi, I'd really appreciate some insights on my situation, and sorry if my english is subpar.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, my girlfriend told me she was worried about my alcohol use. In the last 3-4 months, I've had a rough time, college decided to kick me out despite proving good grades like they asked last semester, ended up losing my student job and my laptop was accidentally destroyed, which contained a lifetime project. I slowly fell in a pattern of drinking maybe 4-6 days a week to help me calm down my anxiety and sleep easier. Of course, as I felt better in the last weeks, I didn't lose this bad habit as I was used to it.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend confronted me about this and I immediately told her I'd stop from now on. So for the last 7 days, I stopped drinking, and suffered through a mild withdrawal, feeling better every day. However, to help me cope with the withdrawal, I chose to chat and game with friends. They all are drinking most nights due to the quarantine, and it's slowly making me crave beer more and more every night. The thing is I use these games and chats to think about anything else than alcohol. I don't want to tell my friends, because I fear they will change how they act around me and how they see me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now for my question : More and more I feel like I'm growing more anxious to be exposed to the envy of having a beer, and I'd like to try to drink more casually, but this worries my girlfriend, who fears I might relapse. I don't want to isolate from my friends, since it's the only thing that helps me power through this, but I feel like I just quit drinking coffee, and every day I'm being shoved coffees in my face more and more and it's increasingly difficult. I intend to eventually drink beer casually like I used to and I think I have the willpower, but I thought quarantine was going to be helping me quit alcohol for a while, like a month, and I'm concerned with the fact that my main solution of gaming and chatting is exposing me a lot more to drinking than my social activities. before the quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy to think I should tamper gradually with my withdrawal? I quit alcohol because I couldn't quit on my own bad habits and my girlfriend noticed me of it, so I fear my judgement might be clouded, I'd appreciate some insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"

I was drinking 750ML of rum pretty much every day. I didnâ€™t go to therapy or AA because I was too ashamed. But I had support from all of my friends. After some time it dawned on me that I was also babying myself in a lot of ways. Wore big sweaters. Applied Vickâ€™s vapo rub to my temples. Watched soothing movies. Slept 13 hours. The whole nine yards. After even more time, during a rare moment of sobriety I booked a trip to England (I live in California) and I just fucking left with no return date. Everything immediately became about surviving in England. For me personally it became super easy to not want to drink because my thoughts were elsewhere. 


Im home now and I still have urges to drink especially in this lockdown due to COVID 19 but Iâ€™ve developed a routine for myself that I stick to every day and itâ€™s been helpful in keeping me sober. Iâ€™ve resigned myself to the fact that a relapse is likely, but I have the tools to get through a relapse.

I would say the last 2 yearâ€™s I drink about 3-5 days a week, most of them alone, unless itâ€™s a wine night or a dinner party or going out. When Iâ€™m alone I like to drink and then Iâ€™ll over drink because itâ€™s like Iâ€™m chasing this feeling that I canâ€™t seem to ever get, and thatâ€™s why I keep drinking, because I think itâ€™s reachable. What usually happens is Iâ€™ll drink 6 to 8 beers, depending, and then wake up dehydrated, but not hungover. Sometimes Iâ€™ll force myself to stay awake to drink more to feel â€œgoodâ€.

I've gotten so much done today!  Since I'm stuck at home I'm doing some inexpensive decorating of my apartment.  When I broke up with my ex fiance I got some things from the dollar tree to decorate my new place.  I was working the longest hours I ever had and didn't have time to make the place my own, though.  Yesterday and today I've put those peel-off wall stickers on some walls, hung up my pictures, added lighting, planted a hibiscus, succulents, and sowed some seeds to repot in a few weeks.  It's even cleaner than it was in here!  I've always been artistic and great with interior decorating but alcohol-induced apathy and depression made me not care much about it.

But how when I drink now, and for the last few years, it hasn't been fun.  I just go into autopilot.  The lights are on but no-one's home.  I just feel hollow and depressed the whole time and each time I drink those feelings intensify.  It's such an empty feeling.  It's the exact opposite of fulfillment in every way.  A waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of a previously good feeling, a waste of the confidence and self-esteem I'm slowly gaining.

I hope you're all having a great day!  I'm here if anyone needs to chat.  Stay strong.  If you screw up realize that you did, but don't focus on that.  Focus on your goal and making a plan for acting differently next time.  That's what's finally been helping me out.  :) &lt;3"

alcoholism,,"Same ol' song and dance 

So i spent the majority of my younger years being wild. The tail end of it was mostly spent doing as much heroin as i could. Luckily i got arrested before i overdosed for the last time. I pleaded with the probation officer and she sent me to a state rehab, i got clean, and I've been off drugs since '09. I never did like alcohol too much, but after i got off probation I told myself that "" shit i got off heroin and everything else. I deserve a couple of vices."" (alcohol and cigarettes). It's worked for a long time. I've been functional. I got married, bought a house by 30.

The thing is though that its getting old. I'm not in my 20's anymore and it's wearing on me. The problem is that over time drinking has become part of my identity. Me and my wife's first date was at a piano bar. The alcoholic me is the only person shes ever known. Things that i enjoy are intertwined with having a beer. Mowing, have a beer. Work on the house, have a beer. Bad day, have a beer. Great day, celebrate with a beer... etc.

Whats really gotten me in the last couple of years is having a job where i work 4, 10 hour days. I've pretty much stopped drinking on my days when i work the next day, but the days I'm off is fair game. I start drinking at about 3-4 do some work around the house, finish the 12th beer at about 2, wake up at noon. Rinse repeat. The thing that really gets me is though, those four days at work. I don't drink and shit does it feel good not to wake up hung over. I tell myself that shit if i feel this good I'm not drinking the rest of the week. I wake up the last work day of the week and am excited. ""I'm not going to drink the rest of the week. I feel great."" Then by the time i get off i head to the corner store for some beer. Insane autopilot.

I've also started some programming classes recently trying to better our situation and I've been kicking ass at it when I'm sober. Feeling good using my full potential. . Then back to my old ways, getting behind on homework because I'm too hung over to think.

My problem is though even though i love my wife to death, and would share anything with her ( actually now that i think about it, i keep aaaalot of shit to myself. Blame it on the emotionally distant upbringing...). I can't bear to confide in her with this. So here i am, drinking once again, calling out to a room full of strangers for some assemblance of understanding.

Just as a note, and no offense meant, I've been to AA and NA but i cant stand all they teach. Higher power and all that nonsense. ""Sometimes all you can do for the day is be sober."" I don't believe in that. We are the ones that get sober, albeit with the help of others. I do need help no doubt, but not from some man in the sky. I will admit however how ironic it is that the only time i reach out for help to quit drinking is when I'm drinking. If there was a god, hes got a sick sense of humor.

I'm reposting here because apparently you'll get blocked for posting when you're drinking in r/stopdrinking. Isnt that the point? The people who are drinking need the advice to quit drinking?"
alcoholism,,"Sobriety in a nutshell (AA driven) Bobâ€™s rules of AA

1)	We do not drink, no matter what.   This too shall pass.  The person, place, thing, event, or feeling which makes us desire a drink will usually be gone in a short period of time.   Drinking, and the consequences of drinking, will be there much longer, perhaps forever.

2)	Find 3 meetings a day where you feel comfortable, so that you have a place to go if you have the desire to drink, and so that you have a place to go when you want to avoid a particular person in the program.

3)	Do not call your sponsor at 2AM with a problem that you had at 10PM

4)	Every person in the program knows what day one is like, regardless of how far away they are from their own personal day one.  We have all been there, we all understand what the process of getting sober is like.

5)	Wisdom is the ability to recognize a mistake as we are making it again.

6)	Progress is stopping that mistake earlier in the process

7)	Doing or saying something harmful to another person and then apologizing is not the same as not doing or saying it in the first place.    See  # 6!

8)	We work the steps in order.  Parts of step 9 can be done prior to completing step 8, but only after consulting a sponsor, since the second part of step 9 emphasizes that we do not take actions which could injure them or others.

9)	When sharing at a meeting, we tell our story in the form of how it was, what happened, and what it is like now.  We speak using â€œIâ€, â€œme,â€ and sometimes â€œwe.â€  We use the progress in our lives to attract others to this way of life.  When we speak using  â€œIâ€, we internalize the event or feeling into our story.  As long as we are telling our story, we can never be wrong.  I cannot tell another what to do in a share.  I can only say what I did, and what the results were, good or bad.  It is then their decision to try what I did, or perhaps what another did.

10)	The word â€œyouâ€ shall never be spoken when sharing at a meeting.   â€œYouâ€ is NOT part of â€œourâ€ story.   When we use â€œyouâ€ in a share, we are promoting the program, which is a violation of the 11th tradition.  When we share using â€œyou,â€  we separate ourselves from the event or feeling.  Nearly everyone coming into AA has a big problem with trust.  All of our lives we have heard you, you, you, and therefore we close off our eyes, ears, and minds when the word â€œyouâ€ is spoken.  We take on a defensive stance.  But when a person shares in the form of â€œI did, I thought, I felt,â€ we listen because they are talking about themselves and not us.   Basically, the word â€œyouâ€ in a share helps no one.

11)	If we employ the 12 traditions in our personal conduct in other affairs, we will always be at peace with our decisions.

12)	Here are the odds.   One in five people who need this program ever make it to their first meeting.  Of those, one in five make it to one year.  When a person leaves AA, their chance of getting back are one in five.   So for every person who shares at a meeting that they have left and come back, there are four people who left and never made it back.  The odds of coming back are not good, therefore it is best to not leave in the first place.    See  # 1!

13)	AA is for those who want it.  This program cannot be sold.  The only way a person gets sober is by being attracted to the changes they see in another.  The only way we can help a friend or family member is to get ourselves sober first.

14)	A person who is actively drinking is ten times more likely to get us drunk than we are to get them sober.   We never make a 12 step contact by ourselves.  Alcohol is cunning, baffling, and powerful.

15)	Go to meetings until you hear someone tell â€œyourâ€ story.  If you never hear your story, at least you have been to a lot of meetings.

16)	In the beginning, all we have is â€œour story.â€  At the end, all we have is â€œour story.â€  With work, the â€œwhat it is like nowâ€ part will be much better.

17)	We cannot give away what we donâ€™t have.  We cannot keep that which we donâ€™t give away.

18)	The Serenity Prayer can be shortened to â€œis it me or is it them?â€   If its me, I work on it.  If its them, I let it go.  See #5.

19)	You canâ€™t bullshit a bullshitter.  Donâ€™t even try.  Its insulting.   ;-)

20)	Never make a major decision before consulting another member of the program.  If they think it is a good idea, then it probably is.  In the process of explaining my idea to another person, I often discover problems or issues I hadnâ€™t considered when I first came up with it."
alcoholism,,"Tapering advice, please  

Hello, friends.

I'm 47 years old, been drinking since about 21. Highly functional alcoholic. Gainfully employed, no DUI, etc.

Mostly  beer, though lately vodka and whiskey. I don't drink all day - but  immediately after work until bedtime. Sometimes all day on the weekends.

I'd say I average 6-12 beers every night. Been this way for about 20 years.

I  need help tapering to avoid withdrawal and keep my life together. I'm  working from home during this pandemic, and have to have my mental  facilities in good shape.

I just  started taking Naltrexone 4 days ago, based on my friend's  recommendation. He's very much like me, only 10 years younger. It seems  to help me drink less, except last night when I got blackout drunk on  whiskey. Woke up today with mad hangxiety...

To  my point:

I need to taper down with as few side effects as possible. I  am on my first beer of the evening. I intend to stop at 3 or 4. I will  likely do this for a few days, then decrease by 1, and continue until I  can have  only 1 drink per night to keep the withdrawal away.

Please give me any advice. I'm scared and I want to get better. I cannot go to treatment, and am doing this myself.

I also appreciate any success stories from those who have done something similar.

TL;DR:  
Please help me taper as painlessly as possible and give me success stories!"

alcoholism,,"I took a sip of my boyfriend's afternoon coffee...bourbon I've (20f) been with my boyfriend (23m) for two years now, and honestly have had concerns about his drinking the entire time. But things are starting to escalate and I'm worried. 

The other day I picked him up from work, and he had an iced coffee with him. Very normal since he works at a coffee shop. We get home, and he goes out in the porch for a smoke. I see his coffee on the kitchen table and something inside of me tells me to take a sip. It's not just iced coffee. Its a Strong iced coffee/bourbon combo. That he was halfway done with at 2 pm on a Wednesday. I bring it up and he laughs it off. 

He drinks every night. We live together, so even before quarantine i saw him most nights and every night he would drink. But since quarantine has started he has had at least two drinks every single night. His drink is gin with grapefruit juice over ice. He makes a stiff drink, i wince a little when i take a sip. 

However, I don't really notice a big change in his behavior when he starts drinking. He never seems ""drunk"". I myself like to have a fun night of drinking maybe once every two weeks, and even when we're drinking together, like to get drunk together, he never seems that intoxicated. 

All the articles I've read said if he was an alcoholic I'd see a big change in his behavior when he's intoxicated, but i never do. 

How do i talk to him? What steps can we take in quarantine to better his health?"
alcoholism,,"Medical Detox? So I drink between 18-20 beers a night. Then get up and work 8-5pm at my job. Itâ€™s very taxing on my body. Every now and then my body just canâ€™t do it anymore and Iâ€™ll sleep almost 24 hours. The shakes have gotten really bad and itâ€™s embarrassing when Iâ€™m trying to show someone something on my phone. Night sweats and just randomly get hot are really bad to. Also my left kidney has started to hurt, and gets worse everyday. 

With these signs, I was wondering if I would need to medically detox. I donâ€™t know what I would do about work though. Iâ€™ve been wanting to quit so bad and swear I wonâ€™t drink the next morning, then when 5pm comes around itâ€™s straight to the liquor store. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you."

alcoholism,,"My roommate is an alcoholic My mom is an alcoholic and so i am very aware that i cannot change anyoneâ€™s behavior and that it has to be from that person, but Iâ€™m wondering what I can do to support my roommate/one of my closest friends. Her drinking has become worse in quarantine, going from like ~5 drinks most nights to 8+ every single night (we also live at a high elevation). Itâ€™s REALLY hard to watch. She has a fucked up family, her dad died 5 years ago, and she has never had proper support in her life until now (im considering my other roommate and i support in a friend aspect, not professional). Last night was an awful night where she accidentally broke a body-length mirror and had an intense emotional breakdown, which my other roommate and I talked her through and got her into bed. But my roommate and i have decided that something has to happen/change. She has gotten herself in very bad situations before where she ended up in the hospital, she skips out on her responsibilities often, etc. My other roommate and I are going to remove our alcohol from the house and not drink in front of her and refuse her offers if she offers us anything. What else can we do to support her not drinking?

alcoholism,,"Alcohol Mom Relapsed Hi everyone, I see that this is a common type of post, though I am asking for some advice. To make a long story short, my mom was a lifelong functioning alcoholic. She was a good mom but that doesnâ€™t mean she wasnâ€™t tipsy half of the time. Two years ago when turned jaundiced and was hospitalized. The doctor said if she didnâ€™t stop she would die. She made it through and appeared to be fine for two years though sheâ€™s been drinking since Easter, coming home drunk everyday after work. Two days ago i went to her privately and told her if i catch her drinking again i will tell my dad (heâ€™s not a dumb man but genuinely has no idea when sheâ€™s tipsy and when sheâ€™s not). She swore it was just for the holiday and due to stress and i left it at that. I guess I just need advice on what to do? I want so badly to text her from a room away and tell her how much I refuse to go through this again. I want to tell her that if she wants to drink her life away and be dead by 60, thatâ€™s up to her but Iâ€™m done caring because I literally cannot go through all of this again. I have a lot more worse things to say but Iâ€™m keeping it brief on here. Any advice on what to do? Do I call her out in person? Iâ€™m just so completely overwhelmed but emotionally, I canâ€™t handle a round 2. To note, I am 20f. Thanks for any advice :)"
alcoholism,,"Need Advice for my Alcoholic Mother My mom has been a functioning alcoholic as long as i can remember. Practically drinking herself to sleep every day after work then waking up to go to work. A cycle that resulted in my parents divorce and verbal/ mental abuse to me as i grew up. I lived with her half the time and my dad the other half because my school was close to her house, but itâ€™s just been getting worse over the years, especially after i went to college.

Sheâ€™s definitely on a lot of prescription medication that shouldnt be mixed with alcohol. She has had several life threatening situations as a result. I have talked it out with her countless times. She has gone to rehab, alcohol classes, and AA meetings. Shes lied about quitting countless times. 

Visited her alone today to talk it out (she doesnt really have close friends or local family) she told me she gives up on trying anymore because of X reasons. And she will buy more alcohol if i throw out what she has. She was also drunk - shes always drunk when i come over.

I cant let her drink herself to death. I dont want her to continue harassing my Father and I (through nasty phone calls and texts). She lives alone and wont do anymore self help â€œbecause theyre all religion based.â€ I gave her an ultimatum that i wouldnt talk to her unless she quits drinking and she threatened to kill herself.

She's extremely weak, been in hospital for 8 of the last 12 months, immune system is fucked and the rest of it.  Alcoholism even killed my dad a couple months ago. 

To my knowledge she hasn't drank since last year which was the last time she went into hospital before coming back out a couple months ago. She's been living with her mum since and they haven't been getting on locked in the same house together due to covid and she says she's going mad. Anyway I went to see her earlier to take her to the shop in her wheelchair and she bought some gin. I wasn't happy with that and she swore she wasn't going to drink it but I know it's a lie.

Iâ€™ve slowed in my need to party but he is a few years younger than I, and no where near ready to slow down. During this quarantine Iâ€™ve begged him not to get wasted. Drink, feel free, but just donâ€™t get wasted. Two or three times a week heâ€™s stupid drunk. I get mad, I yell, he apologizes and says it will stop. Of course, nothing changes. 

I canâ€™t get any mental clarity about if this is a â€˜meâ€™ problem or a â€˜himâ€™ problem. Weâ€™ve had a long successful marriage that Iâ€™m not willing to give up on yet. I figure that much more of my nagging and heâ€™ll divorce me and take the matter out of my hands. 

Heâ€™s mostly a sweet happy drunk, only occasionally getting mean and defensive. Heâ€™s just annoying and kind of stupid and not a great partner in that state. His way of escaping the stress and boredom is to get drunk, which makes me miserable. Iâ€™ve tried to get my head right about it, tried to accept it but I still get so angry. Help.

alcoholism,,"Made a plan to quit drinking. Terrified of the withdrawls. Long time lurker first time posting. So im not sure what to put here.. Ive messed up my life alot with alcohol in the past and paid the price but never really learned anything except how to better hide my drinking.

With everything going on and where I am in life I need to change cause the world is going to be so different I can't see a way forward if I dont stop drinking. Ive never really made any significant changes to better improve my future only reactive to stay where I am in life.

Been unemployed for 2 months and lost my last job due to drinking. Before that I was a chef for 12 years and able to maintain jobs while drinking for years on end. Left my last kitchen job of 8 years in July of last year in an attempt to remove myself from the culture and quit drinking after I got my second OWI.

I didnt stick with it tho and kept up with my drinking. Now I'm almost flat broke. Up to my eyes in debt and fines and unemployed with no prospects for the future because of my drinking fucking up my life. Been going to bed blacking out nightly and waking up everyday for the past month in quarantine and slamming a coffee cup full of rum to stave off the shakes so I can hold my fork steady while I try to eat breakfast.

I WILL WAKE UP MONDAY and break that cycle. Must make it happen for myself this time and move forward in life before I'm homeless.

alcoholism,,"Self Harm while drunk So I didnt know where to post this, I assumed people here would have the best answer. I am not a cutter or a drinker. Due to this quarantine I've been drinking more than usual. And by usual, maybe I'll get tipsy once every 3 months. Now I'm drinking like every other day. I have only cut myself once when I was in college and going through some severe depression a couple years ago. Anyways I've gone through a lot of therapy and such since that time and have never felt better. Even In this quarantine I've been quite positive, every time I drink or do get drunk the most harm I do is smoke a few more cigs than normal or send snaps to my friends about my love for henry cavills abs, no homo lmao. 
Last night while drunk, I was trying to work on a screenplay, I'm an independent Filmaker, and I could not put the words together or think of any transitions. I went for a sit down pee and saw the new box of razors just sitting there, and next thing I knew I had purposely cut myself 3 times over the healed scar. They were very light but still, I havent been suicidal or even depressed enough to think about suicide for at least 5 or 6 months. I still dont feel that way either now. I'm wondering if alchohol can make a person react to repressed emotions that I'm not realizing I still have. Does anyone have any personal experience with this?

TL;DR- I cut my arm on purpose while drunk. I have a history of semi-psychotic depression and suicidal thoughts but have gone through therapy. Is the alchohol retrieving repressed emotions.

Also I'm not gonna cry or kill myself over jokes, this is reddit and I never take myself too seriously."

We'll see if you ever actually find this letter since this was a throwaway account for some.stupid shit and you're Keeevin right now (for redditors, that's blackout Kevin).

But hopefully, something clicks in you that'll make you stop drinking to oblivion before you f up our life again (pls remember the.first time... you're on track there not gonna lie). For all the redditors out there, I had 6 years clean and sober since I was 20. Now 27 and covid fucked stuff up...

Some notes to self... maybe might enlighten others in the process, or just show them how crazy I am. Again, hopefully Kevin sees them:

(1) You hate this. KEEEEVIN hates this too. I dont feel good right now. In fact, I wish I was sober. Just like wtf dude. You do this alone. Theres literally nothing fun about it... just stop! 

(2) Dont need to say this but yeah, you're gonna be puking tomorrow morning... and maybe afternoon. Isn't it crazy that i can predict this though and still go through with it? Something is seriously f'd up with me. Kevin cannot drink. But that's cool. He was sober  and happy before. 

(3) You've gained 40 lbs since starting drinking again. I hope this isn't our nudie account on reddit. Cause none of those are accurate depictions of ourselves anymore...

(4) Not to cause alarm with redditors but I just dont really feel like trying anymore when I get like this... it was three days ago that we adamantly sweared that we'd stop. I'm getting seriously discoraged in myself.

(5) FUCK no Kev! You can do it! You did it before!!! Dont give up. Just dont get to.this level again. You, Kevin, and Keeevin hate it!!!

(6) Alright, whatever. I'll continue AA. My way hasn't worked so far. Kev - look. You dont need to completely deny AA becuase of religion. Just choose whatever spirituality you want to and get over the fact that the group uses the word ""God."" Its an f'ng metaphor!!! You're a pompous asss shit sometimes, Kevin. Just stop being stubborn and go with the flow or else yah.  KEEEVIN IS GONNA BE WRITING THIS MESSAGE A WHOLE LOT MORE!!

alcoholism,,"How to help an alcoholic in denial with memory problems?  

For a few years my sister (23) has suspected that my mom (62) might have developed a drinking problem. Until about a year ago I (23) didnâ€™t necessarily think she was right, but then began to notice some worrisome behavior. Before I go into the details about whatâ€™s happened, I think itâ€™s also important to note my mom has a memory impairment- it's probably early onset Alzheimerâ€™s that hasnâ€™t been diagnosed, but from an MRI looks very likely. 

About a year ago I would notice sometimes we talked on the phone in the early or late evening she would be slurring her words, and she would be a little more forgetful than normal. I donâ€™t live in the same state and try to see her every few months, but because of this I couldnâ€™t really observe her behavior. 

Last June I visited her to take her to see a neurologist, and I ended up taking her to the emergency room. She had gone on a date, got drunk and wandered out of the restaurant before dinner had been served, and a group of very sweet teenagers called me from her phone, saying she had fallen and hit her head on the sidewalk. Once things calmed down I called her date to try to figure out what happened, and he said she had about 6 glasses of wine and then disappeared. When I picked her up she had claimed to only have 2 glasses, but was very inebriated. At that time I was concerned, but thought with her memory condition she had forgotten how many glasses she had. 

About a month ago I got a call from her around 11:30 am on a Saturday- she was slurring her words and not making much sense- she kept calling me her dogâ€™s name. I called her boyfriend, who sheâ€™s been dating for about 9 months, to see if he could go check on her. It turns out she hadnâ€™t eaten enough and had likely also mixed up medications on top of drinking. He took her out to eat, and again she wandered out of the restaurant. This time he had to call the police to find her. 

With the coronavirus he has been living with her, and today he realized she was sneaking around and had likely been drinking vodka and wine without him knowing and fell and hurt her wrist. When he suggested that maybe they shouldnâ€™t keep alcohol in the house she got mad and told him to leave. She did forget that she said that so he is still with her, but I am concerned because this is such a huge burden for him. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? I am in the middle of moving and we are also in the middle of a pandemic so I donâ€™t know if I should go down to visit or not, and even if I go I donâ€™t know what to do. Any suggestions would be wonderful."
alcoholism,,"Confronting friends about their actions while drunk Might be an odd question, but do you think it's fair to confront your friends (while sober) about things they have done while drunk that you dislike, in order to give them a chance to try and change that behavior? Or should you just stay quiet and pretend everything is fine, so they never know there's an issue? Especially considering they might not remember having done anything.

In my case, I was never confronted, and found out how people felt through another source. As a result, gossip and false rumors spread, and some friends cut me off without even talking to me. If I had been confronted about it, I would have taken responsibility and cut down on drinking sooner. But now, it just feels like I had a bunch of fake friends who were too afraid of confrontation to say anything...

Don't get me wrong, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It just would have been nice for people to be straight with me, yknow? Because now that I'm aware of it, I am going to work on this. Has anyone else experienced something similar?"
alcoholism,,"Recovery / Recovered ? TLDR; is saying youâ€™re â€œrecoveredâ€ and still drinking recreationally a thing? My boyfriend says heâ€™s in total control and doesnâ€™t need recovery. 


My boyfriend of 2 months identifies as a recovered alcoholic, as in he doesnâ€™t need recovery, because he is fully in control. He did identify himself as an alcoholic who used to spend days at a time drunk and could get aggressive back when he was in the military. He says he realized he hated how he felt and how he was living and decided to never get to that place again and since then he has control. 

He says heâ€™s always had a high tolerance (he started drinking when he was 12) and so now he doesnâ€™t drink to get drunk, but he drinks to relax like when heâ€™s socially anxious or just for the taste. He says he needs about 6 drinks to start feeling it. So he does drink more than the average 25 year old maybe but it barely effects him. 

He feels incredibly invalidated if I donâ€™t use the word â€˜recoveredâ€™ to refer to him. He got really explosive the first time I told him that I was very open to accepting that was his reality and that he did feel in control, and that my prior understanding of that feeling of control was called recovery which is experienced in many ways. 

I know thereâ€™s a lot of different ways of experiencing alcoholism and Iâ€™ve heard that there are some people in AA for example who leave and say they are recovered. 

My question is, is Recovered a thing? How can I beat validate him in his experience? Or is it objectively invalid as some of my alcoholic friends would say? Very open to any and all answers."

alcoholism,,"Does cutting people off work? Iâ€™m asking this more on my Momâ€™s behalf but any perceptive is welcome.

A bit of background (feel free to skip) this is my understanding of the situation 
I am a 20 and my dad is an alcoholic. It probably started when I was about 14 due to work related stress. He lost said job when I was 18 and was on/ off benders for about 4 months until he got a job. He was ok for about a month then got into a car accident while drunk. Lost his job, went to jail for a bit but was able to do a home arrest while working program (with a different job). He just finished the program last Friday (it was a nine month program) and his alcohol detecting ankle monitor was taken off. The same day he started drinking again. He left Sunday afternoon and no one in my family knows where he is.

Now the question, should my family (especially my mom) cut him off? (By cut off I mean not let him back into the house, not answer his calls, even my mom getting a legal separation to protect herself) Does cutting people off actually work? We still love him and want to help him, but nothing we try seems to get through to him.

My dad is very manipulative and will no doubt come back to my mom at some point. He will not stop drinking when he gets back. However now that my mom, my sister, and I are working from home having him in the house would make work almost impossible. Plus I have no idea where he has been and could have possibly contacted the coronavirus and give it to us. (I am diabetic and my mom has a heart condition so this is very serious to us). 

This is not what we want at all but at this point he has broken our trust and hurt all of us. I donâ€™t want him to die on the streets but he is unresponsive to help and we just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 

Thanks in advanced for any advice. Like I said all perspectives are welcome."

alcoholism,,"Iâ€™m sober and going very strong, but I feel so guilty about having drunk in the first place....is it normal to keep looking back and regretting? (Backgroundâ€”I [24F] started drinking heavily (frequent blackouts) last November and first tried quitting in February. Relatively short amount of time, but drinking is drinking and I went through the terrible emotions that come with addictionâ€”reliance on substance, sense of worthlessness, insecurity about feelings, heightened sense of depression) 

Iâ€™m not struggling with the alcohol aspect right now and I donâ€™t see myself struggling with it in the near future either because Iâ€™m determined to get my life together. I still have a lot of shit going on, but Iâ€™d rather handle my problems sober even if it hurts to face. 

Now Iâ€™m looking back at the last few months where Iâ€™ve been drinking and I feel so disgusted with myself. I know itâ€™s in the past and Iâ€™m better now, so why do I keep thinking about it and feeling guilty? 

I feel very stupid for wasting my time with alcohol. Iâ€™ve made poor decisions and been rude towards several people while drunk. Iâ€™ve ruined opportunities for myself because I was constantly too drunk or hungover to do anything productive. I stopped caring about my life and became hopeless cos I could forget about everything by drinking myself away. 

Itâ€™s not good to regret, but I really hate myself for having fallen victim to alcoholism for a bit. I canâ€™t help but realise that I could be somewhere better in life right now if I hadnâ€™t freaked out and tried to run away from my problems with alcohol. Iâ€™ve only made things worse for myself by pushing my problems aside and allowing them to grow bigger.

alcoholism,,"I only drink beer. How bad is my detox going to be? I have been drinking since my 21st bday. I turned 33 a little less than a month ago. I have slowly but steadily increased my consumption over this time. Used to be I would drink a 6 pack on friday or saturday night with friends but that turned into buying beer to keep in the fridge at all times, I even have a kegorator now.

Currently I drink light beer, but I drink the 16 oz cans. I drink anywhere from 5 to 12 of these a night. With so much liquid (volume) going in I tend to urinate a lot. Since I drink beer and not hard liquor, I want to tell myself that I don't get as drunk... i start when I get home M-F around 5-6:30 and I drink until I go to sleep which is 11-1am usually. On weekends I start around 3-5 and stay up that late. I am an avid video game player and I think this is my psychological tie in. I used to smoke a lot of weed while playing games but now it's beer. 

I don't drink hard liquor at all. Maybe 2-3 times a year when a family member gives me a shot at a birthday party or while playing a round of golf I will do a shot at the turn.

With all of that being said, I hate the way I look in the mirror, I have gained 30 pounds in the past 4 years (50% is in my face it feels like)

I wanted to get some advice from someone that has been in a similar situation as me. Not a vodka/whisky/rum drinker (no offense) but someone that drinks between 64 - 192 oz of beer a night, every night for a period of lets say at least 3+ years...

Is a medical detox necessary since I only drink beer? What are your symptoms during detox like? Is this something I can do during the week or do I need to take off of work?

alcoholism,,"I am probably an alcoholic. Can I learn to drink moderately or do I have to be 100% sober for the rest of my life? **Introduction:**

Hello everyone I am 31, male. I am Czech and in our culture we get drunk sice 14 years old and it is considered ""normal"". Ever since I started drinkig I had problem to stop when I had enough, so lets say in 70% of all cases I was the drunkest person in our social group. Some times it was funny, but oher times it was embarasing and there is lot of stuff I wish I have not done.

*There are 2 main reasons I drink so much:* 

1. I am quite ambitious and to this day I have not achieved my goals which makes my very unhappy. But I am finally getting there. Few more months and I am set I hope.
2. I am socially anxious person and I feel that I need to drink more to loosen up and be a good companion. Which works fine until the time I over do it and become a ""zombie"".

**Possible sollutions:**

One soulution would be to ditch alcohol all together but that. Mainly because of the social stigma. It is hard for me to be with friends and say: ""Sorry guys i cant have even 3 beers because I cant control myself."" Immediately people judge you for lack of self control. So rather than that I would like to discover some tool for self control.

I have tried an app for my phone which roughly calculates alcholol content in my blood - that kinda worked but I have to really put in the info and stick with it, which sometimes failed.

My other idea is to try 6 months of 100% sobriety to learn how to be in social situations without alcohol. Maybe when I push through it sober I will learn that I dont need alcohol to be interesting and calm.

And finally I kinda hope that if I achieve my goals, it will boost my self confidence and I will become more calm person (up to this day my career is very stressful.)

**My questions for you:**

1. Does anyone here have similar experience with possible solutions that I have pointed out?
2. Did anyone try to push through their social anxiety and realized that that really dont need too much alhocol after that? 
3. Did anyone drank in their younger years and after they matured achieved some level of selfcontrol?
4. Do you have some advice to control drinking but not ditching it all together?

alcoholism,,Liquor while working Anyone else have trouble being productive and motivated without a shot or two or 3 in your system.

I have had an alcohol use disorder for about 3 years now (21). I am in good health which may have strongly  assisted in my recovery. I hope everyone practices social distancing unlike I did, as it is the best way to preserve good health. 

The following is a day by day description of the symptom progression- 

Day 1- had gone out drinking with some friends the night before the symptoms first manifested and I was developing what can only be described as a very irritated sensation in my lungs, as if my lungs were  smouldering coals every time I inhaled. It was cool outside and the cold air exacerbated this feeling, so I assumed it was probably the copious amounts of cigarettes I had indulged in the previous night. 

Day 2- the burning sensation worsened throughout the day but I finally accepted that I was most likely developing the early symptoms of what I thought was probably a cold. Started to cough a lot

Day 3- finally started feeling under the weather, the irritated sensation in my lungs was driving my dry cough that only seemed to get worse. Felt fatigued all day and towards the end of the night I started developing a mild fever. 

Day 4- I woke up in the morning, rendered immobile from body aches, and a record high fever that left me shivering so hard it could have been mistaken as a seizure even under three blankets. I was so fatigued I couldnâ€™t even stand, and it only worsened as the night progressed. I had absolutely no appetite and didnâ€™t have anything to eat all day, as I felt as though even one bite would provoke a vomit attack. I developed a very high heart rate that averaged 130 bpm that turned irregular if I exerted too much effort. I think the scariest thing I experienced throughout the whole ordeal happened that night as my lungs felt so heavy I couldnâ€™t take even half a breath and I was left panting heavily in a prostrate position. I started to panic and consider going to the hospital. 

Day 5- much of the same symptoms from day 3 persisted throughout this day, however towards nighttime I started to drift off into a dreamlike state of disorientation. I can only describe it as hallucinations. I would start to hear voices and see myself in other places only to jerk back into reality in a completely different place than I thought I was. I couldnâ€™t even walk myself to the bathroom because I couldnâ€™t muster enough energy to roll over let alone stand up. I had to have my dad carry me to the washroom and back. 

Day-6 I felt significantly better on the sixth day, I was able to eat small meals and walk around however I still had a severe cough and mild shortness of breath

Day-7 all the symptoms I had started to diminish and I took the whole day to just rest and recuperate from the remaining lethargy and malaise

By day 8 i felt good enough to go out and buy 12 beers which I finished off to celebrate my recovered health 

I maintained a dry cough for about 4-5 days after all the other symptoms disappeared but I have since 100% recovered and feel good as new. 

I just wanted to reassure anyone who might be having a lot of anxiety about Covid-19, that it isnâ€™t a death sentence (although it sure was shitty)"
alcoholism,,"Questions about alcohol detox Iâ€™m an addict with 18 months clean time and very familiar with opiate detox, but not alcohol. 
My partner is an alcoholic (well, he hasnâ€™t admitted it yet) and has been in the hospital for two weeks after detoxing cold turkey at home and seizing 24 hours in. He tried to quit drinking for me. 
He has pancreatitis, pneumonia, and heâ€™s jaundiced. 
I didnâ€™t realize the extent of his drinking because he hid it that well and was a functioning alcoholic. Turns out itâ€™s almost a gallon a day of vodka. 
Heâ€™s still in the hallucinating stage, I talked to him for the first time tonight and he was very confused and I honestly shouldnâ€™t of asked to speak with him while heâ€™s still in the ICU in that state. 
My question is, well everything about alcohol detox. Will he have wet brain? Will he need 24 hour care? The nurse said this is one of the longest alcohol detoxes sheâ€™s ever seen, one of the most severe. Have you seen anyone come out of this still the person they were?"

It used to be a day after drinking, now it's as soon as I drink and lasts days after my last drink. It only completely goes away after days of abstaining. Too bad I can't quit.
