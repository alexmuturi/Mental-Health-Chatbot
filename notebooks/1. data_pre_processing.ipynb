    "\n",
    "**Mental health, fundamentally a state of well-being, is crucial for individuals to realize their abilities, manage life's normal stresses, work productively, and contribute to their communities. Despite the rising global prevalence of mental health issues, including a 13% increase over the last decade noted by the WHO, access to effective treatments remains uneven, particularly among urban youths who face distinct challenges and stressors.\n",
    " Saidika, a burgeoning mental health service provider for urban youth, has encountered challenges due to the growing demand for mental health services. The volume of clients has impeded the prompt allocation of therapy resources, particularly for urgent cases, prompting the need for innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health care delivery. By leveraging the capabilities of AI and advancements in NLP, the project aims to bridge the gap between the growing demand for mental health services and the current limitations in supply and accessibility.**\n"
